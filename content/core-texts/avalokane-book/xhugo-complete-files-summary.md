## Strategy Accomplished

**Content Balance Achieved:**
- 60-70% conceptual content included
- All practical exercises excluded
- Logical framework preserved
- Purchase motivation maintained

**AI-Friendly Structure:**
- Complete conceptual understanding available
- Clear boundaries between free and paid content
- Logical relationships explained
- Individual file focus prevents bulk downloading

**Sales Protection:**
- No complete meditation sequences
- No guided visualizations  
- Strategic "incomplete" notices throughout
- Amazon purchase links prominent

## Next: Complete Manuscript Conversion

**Options for full manuscript markdown:**

**Option 1: Single Master File**
- Complete 158-page manuscript in one markdown document
- Best for your reference and future conversions
- Large file but comprehensive

**Option 2: Chapter-by-Chapter Files**  
- Separate markdown file for each chapter
- Easier to manage and update individual sections
- Better for collaborative editing

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Master file for complete reference
- Individual chapter files for detailed work
- Both available as needed

**Recommendation:** Start with single master file for your reference, then create chapter files if needed for specific projects.

## Ready to Proceed

**Hugo files complete and ready for website deployment.**

**Next step:** Create complete manuscript markdown file for your master reference.
