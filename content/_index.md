# Welcome to Wayism

## What is Wayism?

Wayism is an existential philosophy recognizing that **all humans** are on a sacred journey. We call this the *Butterfly Path* because, like a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, human souls evolve into immortal spiritual beings.

## Core Understanding

In Wayism, we understand three fundamental truths:

1. **Life has Purpose** - Every human experience serves soul evolution
2. **The Path is the Destination** - Growth happens through living, not despite it  
3. **Wisdom Transforms** - Self-reflection converts experience into soul evolution

## The Journey Ahead

"The soul arrives as a caterpillar,
Through wisdom and compassion transforms,
And emerges as a butterfly of spirit."

Every human who has ever lived walks this path. When you're ready to understand it more deeply, explore:
