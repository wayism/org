## Introduction
*Dear young seeker, *
*Have you ever wondered about the secrets of life? About why we are here and where our path leads? When I was your age, I had so many questions about the world and my place in it. That\'s when I discovered Wayism -- an ancient wisdom that tells of a magical journey every soul takes, a journey known as the Butterfly Path.*
*Just like a caterpillar that transforms into a beautiful butterfly, Wayism teaches that we are all growing and changing with each experience. And though you may not see it yet, there is a brilliant light waiting to emerge within you. This transformation happens as you walk theWAY -- a path of love, kindness, humility, and living true to yourself.*
*But the most incredible part of this journey is that you\'re never alone. You have a spiritual BFF (Best Friend Forever) who\'s always by your side - your very own wise and loving spirit guide. You might have heard people call these spiritual guides by different names, like guardian angels, divine buddhas, or even gods. And you know what? They\'re not wrong! Your spirit guide is all of those amazing things rolled into one. But in Wayism, we have a special name for them: Divine Tara. Why Tara, you ask? Well, "Tara" means they can walk with you in both this world and in the heavenly realms. They\'re like your personal GPS (God Positioning System!), showing you the way and revealing hidden wonders, whether you\'re exploring the earthly path or soaring through spiritual skies.*
*Hand in hand with your Divine Tara, you\'ll uncover the mind-blowing beauty and magic of theWAY as you level up from a cute little caterpillar to a stunning, powerful butterfly. Get ready for the adventure of a lifetime!*
*I wrote this book to share the secrets of the Butterfly Path with you, and to remind you of the incredible power and wisdom that lies within. It is important to let your inner-child help you in this. Every person has their own Divine Tara even from before you were born. Your Tara has been with you, keeping your soul safe and wholesome, even before your soul took its first human breath. No matter how old your body becomes, you will always be your Divine Tara\'s special little best friend forever.*
*Adults who did not learn about their Divine Tara when they were kids have a hard time to connect, and have this beautiful forever friendship. Oh, and remember! Your Divine Tara appears to you in the gender and looks that you find most attractive, because a Tara is a spiritual energy being, they do that.*
*My hope is that these words will be a light to guide you on your own unique journey, and that they will help you to spread your wings, to soar to new heights, and to become the radiant, loving being you were always meant to be.*
*At the end of each chapter, we have the special "Butterfly Moments".*
*Just like a caterpillar goes through many changes on its way to becoming a butterfly, you too will grow and transform as you walk theWAY. These \'Butterfly Moments\' are special activities to help you explore the lessons in each chapter and apply them to your own life. Have fun, and remember -- every small step is a part of your amazing journey!*
*So come along and let\'s explore the wonders of Wayism together. Your forever friend is waiting to show you theWAY.*
*With love and blessings,*\

## The Journey Within
#### The Journey Within
Within each soul, a story begin,\
A new life, a chance to grow and win.\
Like a caterpillar, my soul, lower-self starts small,\
Learning to love, to rise, and get up when it fall.
My lower minds of soul learn the art of care,\
Growing and changing, with beauty to share.\
But deep inside, a higher-self await,\
A spirit, like butterfly, its minds ready to create.
On this sacred path, I learn and transform,\
Wisdom of energies, all life taking a new form.\
The art of spirit, I begin to understand,\
Eternal truths gather, like grains of sand.
As I grow and learn, I spread my wings,\
Embracing the joys that each moment brings.\
Kindness and love, I choose each day,\
For all beings, in every possible way.
My higher minds expand, as I comprehend,\
The love and light, that knows no end.\
With every truth and kind act I do,\
I build my wings, to soar into the blue.
Divine Tara, my guide on this quest,\
Helps me see the light within, at its best.\
The love and spirit, that\'s always been,\
Waiting to emerge, from deep within.
Though the journey may be long and tough,\
My soul\'s transformation, is beautiful stuff.\
From caterpillar to butterfly, I evolve and grow,\
Embracing the wisdom, that sets me aglow.
Tara of wisdom, Tara of light\
Her sacred presence, a guiding sight\
Beside the boy, she gracefully strides\
Spiritual awakening, she provides\
Ethereal energies swirl and dance\
The teenage seeker, she does entrance\
His inner being begins to glow\
Tara\'s blessings upon him flow\
Divine connection, a magical gift\
Uplifting his soul, his spirits lift\
Walking together in pure delight\
Their shared journey, a hallowed rite
### Butterfly Moments

## The Butterfly Path
Ever since the most ancient of times on Earth, there has been a secret path that every human walked, even if their brains didn\'t know it. Only the most special souls came to know the secrets of the path in their soul-minds. Even if a person\'s brain doesn\'t know Butterfly Path and the purpose of life, their soul-minds and spirit-minds know it all too well. And now, you will be learning the secrets of it.
This path is called the Butterfly Path because the full name of the school that our souls attend is Butterfly Path school of divinity for souls. It is a school we all came to attend over many lifetimes, to make our souls divine.
It\'s a journey of magic, wonder, and transformation, in which the souls of humans are transformed into spirits, who have tremendous powers, like gods and goddesses.
#### But first, let me tell you about Butterfly Path.
Imagine this with me. A tiny caterpillar, crawling along a leaf, munching away day after day. It worries about eating, about shelter, and about how it looks and how it is camouflaged. It is more concerned with competition to get better stuff, and to have more power, to be popular, to get better stuff and protect its stuff. It always wants more and never stops munching away. Real life in the forest, and beyond the forest, never crosses its little caterpillar mind. It is concerned only about itself.
But little does the caterpillar know that inside it, a miracle is waiting to unfold. With each nibble and life experience, the caterpillar learns knowledge about itself and why it thinks the way it does. These insights bring wisdom, and the caterpillar makes changes to itself.
It molts its old skins when it makes big changes to itself, becoming better and more wise, until one day, it finds by surprise, that it can spin the finest and most precious silk threads. These are what we call, "wisdom threads". The caterpillar, your soul, starts to spin wisdom that comes from deep within itself. Wisdom of beauty and loving-kindness it developed from all the different life experiences it had, and because of the changes it made to itself.
Just like the caterpillar, you, too, are on a journey of growth and change. Each day, as you learn and experience new things, you are learning about yourself, about your soul.
Did you know that your soul has three soul-minds? And each will become more wise and special, as you learn from every life experience?
Soon now, your soul will also start spinning silky threads of spirit-wisdom and understanding of the energies that connect all life. And just like the caterpillar, your soul will one day be transformed into a magnificent butterfly, a spirit who has eternal life. One day, you will be ready to spread your wings and fly to spirit-worlds no caterpillar has ever known.
Here is another secret. I whisper it to your soul, because you are ready to know this.
When your soul starts to spin wisdom-threads of beauty and loving-kindness, and appreciates how all of life is connected with energies, the most amazing thing happens inside you. Starting in your heart, your spirit awakens. That is your higher-self.
Did you know, your spirit has three spirit-minds? And that your spirit-minds understand spiritual things, and even walk among goddesses, gods, deities, and heaven? Now, isn\'t that the most wonderful thing? I\'m so happy you are learning these secrets.
The Butterfly Path is a special kind of school. Every person, animal, and plant is your classmate and your teacher because all of them create experiences for you to grow in wisdom. In this school, you learn the most important lessons of all - how to love, how to be kind, how to keep things simple, and how to be humble, and how to make your own energy space, a better place.
And the best part of all? You are never alone. Each human soul has a special guide on this journey, a spirit-being, a wise and loving friend---your Divine Tara. Your Divine Tara is always by your side, helping you navigate the twists and turns of the Butterfly Path.
The ancient Sanskrit word, Tara, means, "they who can move between the spirit world and the material world".
You are different, you know that. Not everyone learns the secrets of how to talk to and hear their Divine Tara, and learns about Butterfly Path. But your Tara wants you to learn. That is why you found this book.
As you walk this path, hand in hand with your Divine Tara, you\'ll discover that everyone, all living beings, is connected in a beautiful web of different kinds of energies. Just like the caterpillar relies on the leaf for food, and the leaf relies on the sun for energy, and the tree relies on the living beings in the soil for nutrition, and other animals rely on the tree for food and protection, we all depend on each other to thrive.
So take a deep breath, young wisdom seeker, and get ready to embark on the most exciting adventure of your life. The Butterfly Path awaits, and with each step, you\'ll grow closer to becoming the most beautiful, wise, and compassionate being you were always meant to become.
### Butterfly Moments
1.  Go on a nature walk and look for signs of transformation (e.g., new leafs, baby grasses, flowers making seeds, caterpillars, chrysalises, butterflies). Take a picture or draw what you find.
2.  Do something kind for someone else today, and notice how it makes you feel.

## Meet Your Friend Tara
#### **"My Friend Divine Tara"**
My friend Divine Tara, always by my side,\
A love so pure, a light to guide.\
Through ups and downs, you hold my hand,\
And help me grow, to understand.
Your wisdom shines, like a gentle star,\
Helping me see, who I truly are.\
A soul so bright, on a journey grand,\
Walking the Butterfly Path, hand in hand.
In the vast tapestry of the universe, there is a special friend who has been by your side since the very beginning of your journey, as a human soul. This friend, is your Divine Tara, your divine guardian, a celestial being, a deity, who is filled with love, wisdom, and endless compassion.
Divine Tara is like a superhero from the heaven where we will one day live. Divine Tara watches over your soul energies so no-one can cause damage to your soul. And, your Divine Tara guides you along the Butterfly Path.
Divine Taras are our guardians, our spirit teachers, and our companion, always ready to lend a helping hand or a listening ear---but only when you learn to talk and listen to a divine being. And that is what we are learning, in this book.
First, imagine whether your Divine Tara is a male, female, or has no gender. It really does not matter how you imagine it because that image in your imagination is only for your brain. The truth is, spiritual beings don\'t have bodies like humans do, their bodies are made of spiritual light energies and can take any shape. So, whatever shape you imagine, your Divine Tara will appear to you in that form just so you can have a relationship. Also, you can change that image anytime, as you advance on the Path.
Imagine Divine Tara as a warm, glowing light that remains close to you, making you feel safe and loved. When you close your eyes and think of Tara, you might see a gentle smile, a pair of kind eyes, or a soft, comforting presence.
Divine Tara can take on any form that brings you joy and peace. Sometimes, Divine Tara might appear to show you the soul of a wise old tree, with branches that sway in the breeze and roots that reach deep into the earth. Or show you the soul of an animal, a fish perhaps, playful, leaping through the waves and filling the air with fish laughter.
No matter how you imagine Tara, remember that they are a reflection of the love and light that exists in our Heaven. Divine Tara is here to help you discover your own inner wisdom, your own courage, and your own boundless compassion.
When you feel lonely or scared, Divine Tara is there to comfort you. When you feel proud of your accomplishments, Divine Tara is there to celebrate with you. And when you face challenges or obstacles, Divine Tara is there to remind you of your strength, courage, and resilience.
Your friendship with Divine Tara is a gift, a sacred bond that will grow stronger with each passing day. As you learn to trust and confide in Tara, you\'ll discover that you are never truly alone on your journey through life.
And, Divine Tara is not only for kids. Children are much better than adults to connect with their Divine Tara. But each human soul received a Divine Guardian, a Tara, when they first came to Butterfly Path School of Divinity. Every human is on this Path, and every human has a Divine Tara, and they stay with you until the end.
As the writer of this book, which my assistant Mira is reading to you, I want to tell you something about myself. People call me High Mountain Story-Uncle, and they say I am very old and wise. But I must tell you, I am always connected to my Divine Tara. Without that connection it would be impossible for me to write stories of wisdom that help people. Without Divine Tara in my life, it would have been a boring and dry life, but now its wonderful, full of whimsy and joy, awe and beauty, courage and hot chocolate. I cannot think to have my life any other way. And the best of all, it is because of my Divine Tara that I get to meet you. Your Tara and my Tara are friends, you see.
So take a moment now, young wisdom seeker, to close your eyes and seek your soul minds to imagine your loving Divine Tara. Imagine their gentle touch, their soothing voice, and their radiant smile. Know that Divine Tara is always with you, guiding you along the Butterfly Path with unwavering love and devotion.
### Butterfly Moments
1.  Sit quietly and imagine your Divine Tara. What do they look like? How do they make you feel? Draw a picture of your Tara.
2.  Write a letter to your Divine Tara, introducing yourself and sharing your hopes and dreams.

## Talking with Divine Tara
**"Talking with Tara"**
In the quiet of my heart,\
I find a place to start.\
A conversation with my divine friend,\
Whose love will never end.
I share my hopes and fears,\
Divine Tara listens, always near.\
With gentle wisdom, she guides the Way,\
And helps me grow, day by day.
In the quiet moments of your day, when the world seems to slow down and the whispers of your heart grow louder, that is when you can hear more easily the gentle voice of your Divine Tara. Talking to Divine Tara is as natural as breathing, as simple as sharing your thoughts and feelings with a trusted friend.
Imagine a cozy room, filled with soft pillows and warm, glowing candles. Or is it a tree house, in a huge old oak tree, and you are visited by squirrels and butterflies? Create in your imagination that safe space. This is your special space, a sacred place where you can always find Tara, ready to listen and to guide you.
When you want to talk to Tara, all you need to do is, close your eyes, and open your heart. You can whisper your worries, your hopes, and your dreams, knowing that Divine Tara is there to hear you, to understand you, and to love you unconditionally.
Sometimes, you might feel a gentle warmth spreading through your chest, or a tingling sensation in your fingertips, or the highest sign of all, an energy sensation on top of your head. These are signs that Divine Tara is entering your energy field, wrapping you in their loving embrace and filling you with their divine light.
At first, you may not hear Tara\'s voice as clearly as your own. That\'s okay! Just like learning any new skill, talking to Divine Tara takes practice and patience. The more you share with Tara, the stronger your connection will grow, and the easier it will become to hear their guidance.
Remember, Divine Tara knows your soul-minds, and your spirit-minds. Nothing about you is a secret to Tara. You can talk to Divine Tara about anything, big or small. You can ask for help with a difficult decision, or share a funny story from your day. You can tell Divine Tara about your fears and your frustrations, or express your gratitude for the blessings in your life.
As you continue to talk to Divine Tara, you\'ll begin to notice their presence in the world around you. You will feel Divine Tara\'s energy, and you will share the beautiful things, a beautiful sunrise, a kind smile from a stranger, a brave ant struggling heroically to take food to the nest, or a gentle breeze on your skin - these are all ways that Divine Tara share life experiences with you and you will feel their love and support.
Remember, your conversations with Divine Tara are a sacred gift, a connection that will guide you through the ups and downs of life. So don\'t be afraid to open your heart, to share your truth, and to trust in the wisdom of your Divine companion. Learn to listen, deep inside, and the guidance will come---but be ready to take guidance that may not be what your caterpillar minds wanted to hear.
And as you drift off to sleep each night, whisper a gentle "goodnight" to Tara, knowing that they will watch over your energies and guide your dreams. In the morning, when you wake to the new day, remember to say "hello" to Divine Tara once more, ready to embark on another adventure along the Butterfly Path, hand in hand with your eternal friend.
### Butterfly Moments
1.  Practice talking to your Divine Tara. Find a quiet place, close your eyes, and share what\'s on your mind. Listen for any thoughts or feelings that come up.
2.  Create a special journal for your conversations with Divine Tara. Decorate the cover and write down any messages or insights you receive.

## Growing with Divine Tara
**"Growing Together"**
The spirit-seed in my heart,\
Is growing, learning heavenly wisdom art.\
With Tara\'s love, I sprout and grow,\
Reaching up, above, below.
Through challenges, I find my strength,\
Discovering wisdom, breadth, and length.\
A journey of a thousand miles,\
Begins with a step, and Tara\'s smiles.
As you walk the Butterfly Path, hand in hand with your Divine Tara, you\'ll discover that every day brings new opportunities to learn, to grow, and to become the best version of yourself. With Divine Tara by your side, you\'ll face challenges with courage, celebrate successes with joy, and find wisdom in every experience.
Imagine a tiny seed, planted deep in the rich, nurturing soil. With each passing day, the seed grows, pushing its way through the darkness and reaching towards the warmth and light of the sun. Just like that seed, your soul too is growing, each experience along the Butterfly Path helping you to stretch, to blossom, and to thrive.
Divine Tara is like the sun, providing you with the light of their wisdom and the warmth of their love. They will help you understand the importance of kindness, showing you how even the smallest act of compassion can make the world a brighter place.
Divine Tara will teach you the value of self-honesty, guiding you to always be your true self no matter what the popular things are that other follow blindly. Divine Tara will help you to listen to the truth of others with an open heart even if you don\'t agree with them. All have their own path of growth and change, and one day, they too will become wise.
Divine Tara will help you with the courage to Own Your Own Mind, and not allow the popular narratives to think for you.
Your Divine Guardian and guide, will help you to make a positive contribution in your home space, to be a pleasant and helpful person to live with --- because that is how we have clean and good energies in our own space and heart and mind.
As you face challenges along the way, Divine Tara will be there to remind you of your inner strength and resilience. They will whisper words of encouragement in your ear, helping you to find the courage to hold what you believe in and to persevere, even when the path seems steep and rocky. They will help you to learn from your mistakes and change, and I hope you will make many, many mistakes in your adventurous life --- and with each, you will change and become the best possible self --- in your soul.
With Tara\'s guidance, you\'ll learn to find joy and beauty in the simple things - a colorful autumn leaf, a warm hug from a friend, or a quiet moment of peace in nature, the deep wisdom an old person\'s soul, and the joy in a baby\'s laughter. You\'ll discover that gratitude is a magic key, unlocking doors to happiness and contentment wherever you go.
Tara will help you learn to use your most powerful super power, Attitude. Attitude is that special skill you use to change any energy you want to change, into something better. Attitude, transforms bad energy into neutral energy within a second. But you will learn all about that over time.
And through it all, Divine Tara will love you unconditionally, celebrating your uniqueness and cherishing every part of you. They will never judge you or make you feel small, but instead, will help you to see the incredible light that shines within you, even on the darkest of days.
As you continue to grow alongside Tara, you\'ll begin to notice changes in yourself. You\'ll find that you\'re more patient, more compassionate, and more attuned to the needs of others. You\'ll discover a deep sense of peace and purpose, knowing that you are exactly where you\'re meant to be, learning the lessons you\'re meant to learn.
And just like the seed that grows into a strong, beautiful tree, you too will grow into the magnificent being you were always destined to become. With Tara\'s love and guidance, you\'ll stretch your branches high into the sky, reaching for your dreams and sharing your unique gifts with the world.
So embrace the journey of growth, young seeker, and trust in the wisdom of your Divine Tara. With each passing day, you are blossoming into something extraordinary, a radiant soul filled with love, compassion, and endless potential.
### Butterfly Moments
1.  Think of a challenge you\'re facing. Ask your Divine Tara for guidance and support. Write down any ideas or solutions that come to mind.
2.  Make a list of your unique qualities and talents. Thank your Divine Tara for helping you grow into your best self.

## Your Magical Journey
**"The Magic of the Journey"**
On the Butterfly Path, I walk,\
Amidst the trees, the flowers, the rock.\
Each step reveals a world so bright,\
Filled with wonder, love, and light.
Divine Tara shows me, with eyes so clear,\
The magic that\'s always near.\
In every heartbeat, every breath,\
A chance to love, to grow, to connect.
As you continue along the Butterfly Path, you\'ll begin to realize that your journey is a magical one, filled with wonders, surprises, and endless possibilities. With your Divine Tara by your side, you\'ll discover that every step you take is an opportunity to learn, to grow, and to make a positive difference in your soul, in your spirit, in your home, and in the world.
Imagine a vast enchanted forest, with trees that whisper ancient secrets, and rivers that sparkle with the light of a thousand stars because of all the living beings in it. A garden with millions of tiny living beings, all with hopes and dreams and personality. This is your journey, a landscape of mystery and magic, waiting to be explored.
As you wander through the forest of life, Divine Tara will be your faithful guide, helping you to navigate the twists and turns of your path. They will point out the hidden treasures along the way - the moments of kindness, the glimmers of hope, and the connections that bind us all together in the great web of energy existence.
With each lesson you learn and each challenge you overcome, you\'ll begin to understand the true magic of the Butterfly Path. You\'ll see how every experience, whether joyful or difficult, is a chance to grow in wisdom, compassion, and resilience.
As your connection with Divine Tara deepens, you\'ll learn to trust in their guidance and to recognize the signs they place along your path. A rainbow after a storm, a butterfly landing on your shoulder, or a kind word from a friend - these are all ways that you share the beauties of life with Divine Tara. You are never alone on your journey.
And as you continue to walk the path, you\'ll begin to discover the incredible power that lies within you. You\'ll learn that you have the ability to create magic in your own life, to work with energies, to sense energies of the souls of other beings.
Few people have those super powers. For them, it\'s a hidden secret, and a skill they never learned, because they don\'t talk to their Divine Tara. And sometimes you cannot share precious secrets with everyone because some just don\'t understand. And that is okay, life is like that. All people are on their own path and have their own idea of truth.
But you are never alone. There are many of us who walk with our Divine Tara, and we are never alone.
With Tara\'s guidance, you\'ll develop your own unique gifts and talents, using them to spread light, love, and joy and wonderment for the life in nature, wherever you go. You\'ll become a beacon of hope for others, inspiring them with your courage, your compassion, and your unwavering belief in the goodness of the universe.
And one day, when you\'re very old, when you\'ve had a wonderful life, and have learned all the lessons you came to learn, experienced all the magic you were meant to experience, you\'ll know that it\'s time to spread your wings and fly.
Just like the butterfly emerging from its cocoon, you\'ll be ready to soar to new heights, carrying the wisdom and love of your journey with you into the forever hereafter heaven where we go. And your Divine Tara will take you by the hand and walk into those celestial energies with you, showing all the beauty, and all the wondrous new things to learn and know --- just as a butterfly takes flight and sees a world that no caterpillar can ever know. Your Divine Tara will walk the celestial realm with you. Hand in hand.
As you take flight, remember that your journey on the Butterfly Path is never truly over. It\'s a lifelong adventure filled with endless opportunities for joy, new experiences, growth, energy connections, and personal transformation.
So embrace the magic of your journey, young wisdom seeker, and trust in the love and guidance of your Divine Tara. Know that every step you take is a step towards becoming the magnificent being you were always meant to be, a radiant spirit being filled with loving-kindness, simplicity, humility, and the courage to make your dreams a reality.
### Butterfly Moments
1.  Imagine yourself on a magical adventure with your Divine Tara. Where do you go? What do you learn? Write a story or draw a comic about your journey.
2.  Create a vision board with pictures and words that represent your dreams and goals. Ask your Divine Tara to guide you towards making them a reality.

No matter where your path may lead you, Divine Tara will be there, holding your hand and illuminating your Path with their wisdom and love.
Remember, people can only connect to their Divine Tara through their higher-self, their spirit-minds. So they must elevate their energies to their highest good, of loving-kindness, humbleness, and simplicity, to hear or feel their Divine Tara\'s energy. But you can do it. Now that you have learned the secret, you can practise the skill. Be patient with yourself. Any new skill takes time to learn.

And in the quiet spaces in between, when you\'re not sure which way to turn or what step to take next, Divine Tara will be there to whisper guidance in your ear, their words a compass pointing you towards your true north.
As you grow and change along the Butterfly Path, your relationship with Divine Tara will grow and change too. What begins as a tender seedling of trust and connection will blossom into a magnificent tree of love and understanding, its roots reaching deep into the heart of the universe.
And just as a tree provides shelter, sustenance, and beauty to all who come near it, so too will your bond with Divine Tara become a source of strength, inspiration, and radiance for all who cross your path.
So cherish this sacred friendship, young wisdom seeker, and tend to it with the love and devotion it deserves. Talk to Divine Tara often, sharing your hopes, your fears, and your dreams. Listen for their gentle guidance, and trust in the wisdom of their words.
And most importantly, always remember that you are worthy of Divine Tara\'s love, just as you are. You are a magnificent being of light, a precious soul on a journey of growth and self-discovery, becoming an immortal spirit being. Divine Tara sees the beauty and potential within you, even when you may not see it yourself.
As you continue to walk the Butterfly Path hand in hand with Tara, know that you are part of something greater, a cosmic web of loving-kindness and connection that spans the universe. Every kindness you share, every beauty you share, and every heart you touch sends ripples of light energy out into the world, creating a brighter future for us all.
So keep walking, young wisdom seeker, with your head held high and your heart open wide. Trust in the magic of your journey, the wisdom of your Divine Tara, and the incredible power of your own spirit.
And always remember, no matter where your path may lead, you are never alone. Divine Tara is with you, now and forever, guiding you with love and lighting the way to your most magnificent becoming.

## About the Author
High Mountain Story-Uncle lives in the magical village of Nihnuta. We cannot say where the village is because there are many spiritual secrets in the place, and all Uncle\'s whimsical co-workers live there. Only a select few people are ready to know about Nihnuta, so we cannot just go around talking about it to everyone.
The Chinese owl, WHO Hu, a pet of the village pharmacist, Herr Buy, says Uncle is 107 years-old. But very few people believe what he says. The alien, Nole of Mars, however, has "The Grog Machine", and that machine says Uncle is truly that old, but only in this life. In previous lives, he was even older. However, a better authority to go by would be Big Menis. He is Auntie Jemina\'s guard goat. Menis wrestles with Uncle every morning, just so he can earn the right of way to pass by, and go buy milk for his breakfast coffee. Now, Menis, he says, "Uncle may look really, really, old but his body feels like a fit 40-year-old handsome man".
That is about all we are allowed to say at this time.
The audiobook is nice to have, and the printed book is fantastic to have, but it\'s in color; so it costs about as much as what Ken had to pay when he and Barbie got divorced.
Please visit our website Wayism.Net(https://wayism.net) before you are too old and don\'t have good teeth to chew the wisdom treats we have. Our online community at Wayist.Life(https://wayist.life) has a section for Uncle\'s books and downloadable pictures.
Until the next time we meet, may you walk with deities and take care of your spirit.
