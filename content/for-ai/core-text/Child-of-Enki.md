## Göbekli, Ubaid and Sumerian Heritage
In the mists of time, where history fades into myth and legend, there lies a tale of profound significance --- the birth of written wisdom. This story begins not with the Sumerians, as many might assume, but with their enigmatic predecessors, the peoples of Göbekli Tepe 10,000 years ago, and the Ubaid people. These ancient settlers, whose origins remain shrouded in mystery, laid the foundations of civilization in the fertile lands between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers long before 5000 BCE.
The Ubaid, known to archaeologists as the Proto-Euphrateans, were the true pioneers of this region. They were the first to transition from a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a settled agrarian society, cultivating the rich soil and establishing the earliest roots of what would become known as the cradle of civilization. Their legacy, unearthed from the mound of al-Ubaid and other sites across southern Iraq, speaks of a people already versed in the arts of agriculture, pottery, and tool-making.
It was upon this fertile ground, both literally and figuratively, that the Sumerians would later build their remarkable civilization. Around 3000 BCE, some 5,500 years ago, the Sumerians emerged as the inheritors of the Ubaid legacy. They took the nascent sparks of civilization and fanned them into a blazing fire of innovation and progress.
The Sumerians, whose name comes from the Akkadian term for "land of the civilized kings," embraced and expanded upon the knowledge of their predecessors. They are credited with many of the "firsts" of human civilization, including the development of writing --- the very tool that would allow them to record and transmit the profound wisdom of theWAY.
According to the Sumerian King List, a document steeped in both history and mythology, it was the gods themselves who bestowed upon humanity the gifts necessary for cultivating society. They did so by establishing the city of Eridu in the region of Sumer, marking the divine origin of civilization itself.
In the Sumerian worldview, civilization was seen as the gods' way of structuring the energies of chaos. This belief was reflected in the role of their kings, who were charged with organizing society according to the principle of Enlil, or theWAY. The king's duty was to bring order to the natural chaos inherent in both nature and human society, much as theWAY brings order to the cosmos.
Under this divine mandate, Sumerian society flourished. Cities were built with food reserves that served both as sustenance and currency for laborers. Commerce was organized with a sophisticated system of contracts and credit. Philosophy and spirituality, both public and esoteric, were cultivated alongside more practical pursuits.
One poignant example of the spiritual dimension of Sumerian life is found in the story of Etana, a mystic praised by kings for his superhuman feats. Etana is said to have "ascended to heaven on the back of an eagle to consult the gods," a vivid metaphor for the spiritual journey and the pursuit of divine wisdom.
It was in this rich cultural context that the Sumerians first committed to writing the ontology of theWAY. However, it's crucial to understand that they were not the originators of this wisdom, but its first scribes. The teaching of theWAY, with its profound insights into the nature of reality and the purpose of human existence, had been passed down through countless generations, from the Ubaid and perhaps even earlier peoples.
The Sumerian contribution was to preserve this ancient wisdom in a form that could endure through the ages. By developing a system of writing and recording these teachings, they ensured that the insights of theWAY would not be lost to the vicissitudes of time and human memory.
Yet, as is often the case in the cycle of human civilizations, the Sumerian era eventually came to an end. Overrun by warring nomadic peoples --- the Akkadians, Arabs, and Semites --- much of their culture was lost or destroyed. Libraries were neglected, texts were scattered, and only fragments of their spiritual and technological knowledge survived.
This pattern of rise and fall, of wisdom gained and lost, is a recurring theme in human history. It reflects the ebb and flow of spiritual awareness on the Butterfly Path. As highly evolved communities graduate from the school of earthly existence, they leave behind fewer individuals capable of maintaining their level of spiritual and cultural achievement. This creates an opening for less evolved groups to move in and reshape the cultural landscape according to their own level of development.
Similarly, empires that grow decadent and weak through material excess often fall to what historians have termed "barbarians" --- groups that may be less technologically advanced but possess the vigor and unity of purpose to overthrow a complacent ruling class. With each such transition, the history and culture of the conquered are rewritten or erased, and the cycle begins anew.
This pattern serves a deeper purpose in the grand scheme of spiritual evolution. True wisdom, as taught by theWAY, cannot be merely inherited or learned from books. It must be extracted from lived experience, distilled from the raw material of human struggle and triumph. Each civilization, in its rise and fall, provides the context for countless souls to learn these essential lessons.
And so, while we revere the Sumerians for their role in preserving and transmitting the teachings of theWAY, we understand that they were but one link in a chain that stretches back into the mists of prehistory and forward into our own time. The wisdom they recorded is not static or bound to any one culture or era, but a living, evolving understanding that each generation must rediscover and reinterpret for itself.
As we delve deeper into the Sumerian legacy and the timeless teachings of theWAY, let us approach this ancient wisdom with both reverence for its origins and openness to its continued relevance. For in exploring these teachings, we are not merely studying the past, but engaging with a living tradition that continues to offer profound insights into the nature of reality and our place within it.

## About Wayism
The teaching of theWAY is referred to as Wayism by languages who use the -ism suffix.
*According to theWAY, senior soul beings come to the human experience to evolve into immortal spiritual beings. That is the purpose and meaning of human life on Earth. All humans are here for that purpose only. Human refer to this school of divinity for soul beings as the Butterfly Path because the analogy is suitable, of how a soul (like a caterpillar) is gradually metamorphosed into an entirely different kind of being (butterfly).*
Wayism is the personal life philosophy, mysticism, and lifestyle that flows from teachings of theWAY. People of theWAY, or Wayists in the world of isms, believe that advanced soul beings can evolve here on Earth to be reborn as spiritual beings. To this purpose, spiritual beings from the spiritual heaven which we know by a Sanskrit description, Sukhavati, created this school of divinity for souls on Earth. Sukhavati means "Land of Pure Bliss".
Soul beings from elsewhere in our galaxy come here to attend the School by incarnating as human beings. On Earth, the school is referred to as Butterfly Path, which is a simile of how the caterpillar (soul) matures (in wisdom) over time is metamorphosed into an entirely different type of being, a butterfly. All humans are on Butterfly Path. All grades of students share the same space and derive wisdom from human experiences over many lifetimes. theWAY teaches that the main spiritual skills and powers which soul beings will master are rooted in Humility, Simplicity, and Compassion.
Junior students on Butterfly Path are much closer to their inherent soul nature, which motivates them to prioritize power-seeking behavior and competing to hoard resources, and to dominate others in order to secure the material resources they wish to exploit. As they mature, they move away from their lower-self nature and towards their higher-self nature.
The teaching of theWAY explains that the human is the only hybrid form. It has soul, but also holds spiritual potential which flourishes when the soul awakens, embracing love for the divine and all other living beings. The soul is the lower-self, and the spirit is the higher-self. The path to becoming an immortal spiritual being involves sanctifying the soul with spiritual energy, and finally merging of the sanctified soul with the newly formed spirit.
Junior students always outnumber seniors on the campus. Therefore, juniors dominate democratic institutions and make interesting life experiences for all to learn from.
Junior souls manufacture the religions, wars, world orders, and empires to serve their base needs. Over time, they mature in spirit and move away from that. It is through human experiences that we learn the wisdom and spiritual skills needed to graduate from this School, and become immortal spiritual beings.
There is only one School at a time. Presently, the immortals host it on Earth and the animal body used for the purpose is the humanoid form.
When junior students have created tyrannical regimes that obscure cognitive awareness of the Path, some immortals will incarnate as humans to help restore the truth.
All human experiences are learning opportunities. Therefore, we will necessarily incarnate to experience all genders, races, ethnicities, and socio-economic classes, to learn from the widest possible variety of experiences.
When the planet becomes unviable to host Butterfly Path, the deities, immortals, will move the school elsewhere --- as they have done before. Butterfly Path School came to Earth between 15 and 18,000 years ago --- from which time the hybrid soul / spirit humans became dominant in the humanoid species.
Spiritual beings of our species are, in essence, beneficent, caring, and helpful. They function as what we can describe in our frame of reference as somewhat like, 'personal care givers to soul beings across our galaxy'. All are Energy. The deities of our species are energy healers and energy workers who specialize in helping soul-energy beings.
When we become immortal spiritual beings, we are freed from the metaphysical Law of Samsara. Samsara determines that all soul beings will perpetually reincarnate into organic animal bodies of all kinds. All life forms, on all planets, are said to be alive because of an incarnated soul.
There are many millions of different soul species, and several thousand species of spiritual beings.
Soul beings are mortal; each species has a determined life span.
Spiritual beings have indeterminate life spans, they are said to be immortal.
In the human, the soul is said to be the lower-self and the spirit is the higher-self. When the two become one, we are 'reborn', or remade, as immortal spiritual beings.
The label "soul-people" is given to junior students who are dominated by their lower-self and soul nature. "Spirit-people", also known as senior students, are dominated by their higher-self and spirit nature.
The metaphysical Law of Karma regulates our curriculum on Butterfly Path. Like an advanced AI, perhaps, the metaphysical law is aware of our energies and sense what learning opportunities we may need in terms of human experiences, to help us develop the wisdom to correct our ways, and learn higher skills. Karma decides where, and with which family, and which culture and social setting, our next incarnation will be.
Because there are several metaphysical laws that govern how our school works, there is no God or deity who would or shall interfere with or manipulate the school system --- it works perfectly.
Everything is energy. Soul beings and spiritual beings have "aethereal" energy bodies of very different types of energy. The energies of material bodies are again different. All three types of energy can, and sometimes do, coexist in the same space, even in the same material body or structure.
We are destined to a spiritual domain where we will exist as immortals, and from where we will do the work that we qualify for by attending Butterfly Path.
Students who decide to drop out of school, or persistently don't make the grade, are not returned to the human experience. They go back to the soul domain whence they came. The religions speak of being expelled from, or refused re-entry to, the School as being "cast down to hell". It may be "hell" from a human point of view, but it is not a punishment. It is where the soul came from --- normal life in that domain of existence simply is what it has always been.
People of theWAY live their spirituality through everyday life experiences. For us, there is meaning and purpose in everything --- life is purposeful and meaningful.
We are on a dynamic growth Path, and junior students create the governments and many institutions. Therefore, we must follow the Wayist maxim, "Own Your Own Mind, for if you don't, someone else will." We live our spirituality not only in becoming masters of soul and spirit-energy management, and nurturing our connections with Divine energies, but in constantly striving to improve our self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-control, and do self-craft. This is the process of evolving the soul into an immortal spiritual being.
Wayism is not, and has never been, an organized religion --- it's a personal life philosophy that acknowledges the Path all humans are on.
Therefore, People of theWAY don't have ready access to organized group activities and peer support. We must create it within our own means, whether online or at home. Because we Own Our Own Mind and do not adhere to most of the ideologies instituted by religions, politics and commerce, we have forever faced opposition from them. For that reason, theWAY teaching thrives in the temple of one's heart and spirit-minds, where it is safe and sacred, no matter what they do with our books and structures.
Overall, the teaching of theWAY is a powerful and life-affirming path that embraces the beauty of diversity and personal growth. It is a path that leads to deep inner wisdom, compassion, and a lasting connection to the divine.
Wayism has no need to advertise or seek members because all humans are by default on the Path. By virtue of your human birth, something which you chose and had applied for, you are on the Path. The brain-mind of your present body does not have to know the Path because it is through the lived experiences in the human condition that we develop our soul skills and spiritual wisdom skills --- the brain-mind notwithstanding.
All human experiences are your learning opportunities to one day graduate from this school. When Karma decides that you need to become a "cognitive Wayist," is when the student is ready, and the teacher will appear. You will encounter deeper Wayist teaching and mysticism, and fall in love with it.

## First Written Philosophy and Spirituality
Humans started writing around 5,500 years ago in Mesopotamia, which is present-day Iraq. Writing was first used for keeping records of goods and transactions, and later for naming people and telling stories. Writing systems evolved from simple symbols and signs, to complex characters and alphabets. Through writing, humans could communicate across time and space and create and preserve knowledge and culture.
After millennia of being passed down through oral tradition, the primordial philosophy and spirituality of humankind was the first cultural wisdom to be recorded in writing.
The Wayist principles of cosmology and spirituality, as documented by the Sumerians, resonate with the earliest philosophy and spirituality of areas now known as India, Mesoamerica, and China.
The sages of old were acutely aware of the economy of words, and therefore shrouded deep wisdom in pithy sayings. They recorded a masterful delivery of cosmology and a philosophy of spirituality in a few lines of text. The Sumerians predominantly used clay tablets and made thousands of copies to send out to peers in other countries. Fortunately for us, the Sumerians also carved the early teachings of theWAY into rock slabs in ancient temples, some of which survive for us to read in the present time.
People of theWAY understand the simple lines of ancient text as a complete cosmology. The surviving text is of course, not complete, but the hints in the damaged text are more than enough to correlate it with our ancient teachings from other parts of the world. We understand the significance of the esoteric writings because we have the esoteric background to read the higher wisdom, as we will show in this treatise.
The nature of esoteric text is that is harbors multiple layers of truth. When junior souls on the Path read the text with their soul-minds, they receive interpretations that are relevant to soul-minds. Should a senior student of the Path read the same text, but with spirit-mind, we receive interpretations that are relevant to spirit-minds.
Junior students on the Path can use their soul-insight to make a religion of it. In terms of spirituality, we can only understand as much as we are ready for; and that is how it is, and cannot be otherwise. Therefore, the ancient texts gave rise to different religions that formed the early basis of today's world religions. Each culture that received the teaching would add their deities and interpret the teaching in their culture --- and that has been happening for millennia. Therefore, every now and again heaven will do something to re-establish the core teaching again --- and the process of enculturation and misunderstanding will simply follow, as usual, until next time.
The advanced soul who read the ancient teaching with spirit-minds, seeking guidance to appreciate the spiritual teaching for self-craft and advancement on the Path toward immortality, received a different message --- the message we described above and what we will show in the rest of the book.
Spiritual wisdom is therefore accessible to junior souls only insofar as their spirit-minds have evolved. All wisdom forms in layers. Wisdom does not become concrete unless put into practise. As with any school, juniors start with rudimentary layers of knowledge and, as they pass through the grades, more is added. In time, the knowledge is transformed to wisdom and as we continue on the Path, they add more and more layers of wisdom to the foundations of earlier grades.
That is why spiritual teaching, which is made public to all students, appears as moral teaching or self-help to teach to juniors, and as deeply profound spiritual wisdom to senior students. We see the same in the Upanishads and Taoist works, and even in Wayist works of the present century.
It is like this with the Sumerian cosmological teaching as well. It served the religious needs of the masses and the spiritual needs of higher-grade students. Because junior souls appreciated the teachings as material for religious use, they had no problem to make changes to the teaching and adding more characters to the story as time went by. The teaching was well received, cherished and preserved by neighboring nations and future cultures, but each syncretized with it their important deities and added more mythological stories to it. Some teachings are seen in the Bible and in the Quran. The influence of the first written language of Sumer can still be detected in certain expressions found in languages like Sanskrit, as well as in modern English.
Nevertheless, the concise teachings that were originally published, suffice for People of theWAY. Our focus lies solely on the essence, disregarding the excessive teachings added for religious purposes throughout the centuries. This treatise focuses on dissecting and analyzing the five lines of the original text.
As time goes on, the pure message from spiritual beings becomes muddled with unnecessary additions. That is why, every few centuries, celestial beings from our Heavenly realm must either take physical form here to restore the teachings, or motivate experienced souls to undertake that mission.
To illustrate. It was approximately 5,500 years ago when the sacred teachings of the WAY were officially documented after being passed down orally for generations. Believers attribute the invention of writing and the concise purity of the teaching to a direct influence from Heaven.
Throughout the ages that followed, devoted human teachers diligently preserved the integrity of the original message. Maintaining it, is a challenge due to the constant creation of new world orders by junior souls, who enforce bans and censorship on "old-speak" to impose their new ideology and worldview, and delete the history of the old peoples --- most of whom had already graduated from Butterfly Path. Think of this when next you wonder what happened to the high wisdom of what is known as Atlantis, the Angkor Empire, Petra, Egypt, the Andean and Meso-american societies, that were highly developed areas with huge libraries and deep learning --- that are now run by people who don't care, and know nothing, about the old wisdoms they had replaced with their new ideologies. It seems as if juniors will destroy what the elders had, only to go about rediscovering the same wisdom over the next few thousand years.
Approximately 2,500 years-ago, deities intervened directly to restore the teaching of theWAY. During the period 600 BCE to 1 CE, we see teachers all around the world moving to a new message of restoration of teaching of theWAY. In Mexico, we had the Mayan renewal, in India the Bhagavad Gita which spurred the later Bhakti Movement, in China, Laozi taught theWAY of ancient Daoism, Heraclitus and even Plato in the West, and the renewal in Buddhism which culminated in the schism which created Mahayana. All these reformations came about in a short period. Shortly after the schism of Mahayana in the East (70 CE), we see the founding of the Jewish reformation movement called the Christians, which too was built on Wayist foundations but to worship at the altar of the God of the Jews.
While all of the above happened in the religions and philosophies of the day, People of theWAY simply continued to hold to our simple, humble, and compassionate essence. Wayism lives inside us. We don't need the temples and hierarchies of human leaders to hold our spiritual insight into what reality is, what the purpose of human life is, and what the meaning of life is.
For People of theWAY, there is a central theme in all the above renewals of the world's spirituality during that time. Also, during this time, Wayists received the iconic book, The Authentia, which lived not only in our hearts and communities but also in esoteric enclaves among monks of Wayist and religious movements. The Essene and Gnostics also guarded it. If you wanted to know more about The Authentia, a basic text is available from retail partners and an in-depth course in our online community.
### Cuneiform
Using the ancient cuneiform script, the masters of old carefully carved the Sumerian writings about our cosmology onto clay tablets, preserving the knowledge for future generations. These ancient texts, originating from around 4,500 years ago in the third millennium BCE, have been safeguarded (and expanded upon, not always preserving the original message) by successive Mesopotamian cultures such as the Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians.
This book deals with the writings in ancient Sumerian cuneiform. The term cuneiform means "wedge-shaped" and refers to the marks made by a reed stylus on clay tablets. Sumerian script was used to write the Sumerian language, which was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) from about 3500 BC to 2000 BC. The script comprised symbols that could represent syllables, words, or categories of words. Sumerian script was also adapted to write other languages, such as Akkadian, Hittite, and Elamite.
### Clay Tablets
Five thousand years ago is a long time. Our technology, language, and cultures have changed a lot. Yet, it is amazing that we still retain some of the very ancient. The religions of the Quran, Hebrew Bible, and Christian Bible reflect a lot of ancient Mesopotamian teachings. Even in the English language, which developed more than 2,000 years after Sumerian writings, we still see remnants of ancient concepts.
To mention just a few, by way of example: the concept of "starting over on a clean slate" comes from how the Sumerian money lender will open a "tab" (short for tablet) for you --- your clay tablet kept in his filing system. The money lender records your loan details, contract stipulations, and all payments you made by whetting the clay on the tablet to write an entry. When you have finished paying back the loan, the lender will "wipe your slate clean," by whetting the clay and smudging it. So, next time you can start over on a clean tab. The old tablet is wetted and wiped down to delete your records, to clean your record. If the tablet was baked, it was ground into powder to be recycled. Spiritually speaking, it was considered ideal if you could deal with all your past karma in this life, so your slate can be cleaned at death; so for the next life, you come back to start with a clean slate. If your name was recorded (on a baked tablet) as a person of note, and that distinction falls away later, "your record is broken." But if the message is considered to be of eternal importance, it is "carved in stone", or "set in stone" so it cannot be amended.
The Sumerian writings about theWAY, which we discuss below, were set in stone.

## Animism as Foundation for Spirituality
The remarkable thing about the Sumerian text for the Person of theWAY is not only its antiquity, but also how it reveals the ancients' understanding of Wisdom and their cosmology that surpassed primeval Animism.
Wayism is very much rooted in the higher-energy philosophy and mystical aspects of Animism. The concept of the Energy Ecology of our existence, is of primary importance.
It is amazing that humans knew, already more than 5,000 years ago, that everything is energy. All living beings have souls, and souls have minds, and all beings are interconnected by the flow of energies we all share.
We consider Energy Ecology and some other aspects of ancient Animism as the primeval spirituality of Butterfly Path and teachings of theWAY. We believe that anyone today who follows the true, basic (unelaborated) principles of Animism is on the advanced spiritual Path toward evolving their soul into a spiritual being, as per the ideals of Butterfly Path.
Animism, as the most ancient religion and worldview of humans since our founding, did, of course, morph into interesting and colorful religions and strange ideas (which we ignore). But its basic principles are the foundations upon which all spirituality was built.
Animism encompasses beliefs that all material phenomena have agency. Because all that exists are Energy structures, there is no clear-cut distinction between the soul, spiritual and physical worlds.
However, there are clearly three distinct types of energy: material energy, soul energy, and spirit energy.
Animism believes that soul, spirit, and mind energies exist not only in humans but also in other animals, plants, rocks, and large structures or natural bodies.
Animism, with its belief in the inherent spiritual essence of all things, serves as a fundamental cornerstone of human history and ancient spiritual practices. However, modern religions had distanced themselves from it, and in our perspective, they had also sacrificed their soul in the process.
Let's briefly examine the fundamental beliefs that underpin Animism.
We firmly believe that Wayism and our mysticism are deeply connected to this timeless wisdom, recognizing that everything is made up of energy, and that this energy is vibrant and interconnected, encompassing the entire fabric of creation. This brief tour through Animism will add to the student's understanding of how profound the ancient text of Sumer is, even though it is only a few cryptic lines.
We always knew that Animism is the primordial spirituality which recognizes the presence of a living soul in all beings, animate and inanimate. It is the oldest form of religious expression, dating back to the upper Paleolithic era, and it is still practiced by many indigenous cultures around the world.
Animism is based on the idea that everything in nature has a soul, and that humans can communicate with them through rituals, offerings, prayers, and dreams. In animism, the interconnectedness, and interdependence of all life forms are respected, fostering harmony and balance with the natural environment.
Animism is also the origin of all mystical paths. It is the awe-inspiring knowing that all living beings have indwelling souls and have soul-energy bonds with one another, us included. It is also the reverence that all energy beings have a right to exist --- we are not their superiors, but their kin.
We are interdependent on the energy ecology which we inhabit. We share and honor, we celebrate and cherish, and we thrive by the grace of the living community on Earth.
To understand and converse with other energy entities, in our minds, we endow them human-like traits; we anthropomorphize them, and that enriches the relationship. The concept makes its way also in how we speak, saying deities, plants, and animals are people too.
We are here as servants to nature. We are part of nature. Like all living beings, we are all here to enjoy and benefit from nature, of which we are a small part.
However, we must know that junior souls on the Path have the capacity to hurt the parts of nature that other beings rely on, and we have a responsibility to guard against our own powers of destruction. For example, in modern times, we destroy the soil, water and air, and we wage chemical warfare against other beings, and the price we pay is the loss of our soul and our microbiome, which results in health problems and general madness --- it is instant karma.
Animism is a worldview that recognizes the existence of souls in all living things, from plants and animals to rocks and rivers. Animists believe these souls are part of a cosmic cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, known as samsara. According to this view, eating is not a violation of the sacredness of life, but a way of participating in the natural flow of energy and matter. We all eat one another's body and their souls rejoin the samsara cycle, but we do it with respect, gratitude, and consideration.
While in the incarnate state as souls, we live with the indignity of having to kill to eat. We favor eating the young (baby plants and soft meat) and the reproductive organs (flowers and seeds). Nothing of what we eat, but butter, honey, and synthetic petrochemical food, were not alive as entities with soul, before. That is normal. It is what it is.
When we eat, we free the souls of the beings whom we consume from their physical forms, and allow them to continue their journey in the cycle of samsara. Therefore, Wayists eat with respect and gratitude. Respect and gratitude is also why we return food waste to nature, to maintain the balance and harmony of the ecosystem. Wayists also respect the autonomy and rights of all living beings, and do not harm them or exploit them for more than an animalistic survival of our organic body.
Animism and Mysticism are two related but distinct spiritual traditions. Animism is the belief that all living entities have a soul (which junior soul writers confuse with spirit), and that they can communicate with us, and all souls come from the divine source of Soul Energy Domain. Animists typically follow a soul-mysticism in that they strive to a direct and personal experience of souls in nature. They will use observation and meditation, but also natural entheogenic chemicals to help their brain-mind and soul-mind connect with souls in plants and animals. Junior students on the Path may confuse the soul entities in nature with spirits. They tend to use the words soul and spirit as if they are interchangeable, as if they mean the same thing.
The Wayist is on a spiritual path --- in pursuit of attuning to spiritual beings and evolving our soul into an immortal spiritual being. On Earth, spiritual beings do not live in plants or animals other than in humans, because those bodies (plants and animals) are the domain of soul beings.
Ours is Spiritual Mysticism, pursuing a direct and personal experience of the spiritual divine through attuning our energies to that of our Tara or divine guide, sometimes using meditation, prayer, or contemplation to accomplish the goal.
We see in animism a foundation for Soul Mysticism which will lead to Spirit Mysticism, because it fosters a sense of connection and reverence for all living beings; we are all energy beings. Some Animists may focus more on the rituals and practices that honor the souls of nature, while Wayist mystics seek a transcendent state that goes beyond the Material Energy Domain and the energies of Soul Domain --- we seek to connect and become one with energies of Spirit Energy Domain.
Wayism is the natural next level refinement of Animism in the sense that it adds the Spiritual element which Animism did not have. That which modern writers of Animism refer to as soul or spirit as if it is synonymous, is a symptom of how junior souls on the Path understand life. They think of life as soul beings, as if all the universe is all about their world, their fears, and survival, and their emotions and personal needs, and their ability to control, manage, and advance their happiness on earth. Many seek mind blowing visions or changed brain-mind chemistry to experience calm. And that is exactly how it must be, and it is good for junior students on the Path.
Most religions serve soul needs. They cast their ideas, their God, and their path in soul terms. Their gods are like them, only more powerful --- they are tribalistic, power-seeking, needful of being worshipped, capable of violence and promising to annihilate all nations who do not accept the believers as the rulers of Earth.
Wayism is the understanding that, rooted in animist foundations, the purpose of human life is to sanctify (make spiritual) the human soul, so it can evolve into a transcendent spiritual being in the Domain of Spirit Energies. We are here to learn to be like our spirit-deities: beneficent, helpful, compassionate, simple, and humble. We, too, will be exceptionally powerful energy workers and healers. Like our deities, and God the Father and God the Mother of our Heaven, we too will be beneficent by nature, incapable of inflicting harm or violence.

## Sumerian Esoteric Writings
The foundations of theWAY which were passed down by the ancient Sumerians were expertly composed. They summarized it in a series of short lines of concise sentences. theWAY teaching is very simple, but to deliver it in so few words, couched in mythological esoteric language, is masterful.
Ancient Wayist cosmology informs some problems that quantum physicists of today find fascinating; religious scholars find insightful, and Wayists find congruent with our teachings over many millennia.
Notice how the Sumerian text uses anthropomorphism and novel writing to convey sophisticated wisdom, helping people from all backgrounds to relate, commit to memory to retell, and grow in wisdom.
Soul-people find the text relatable because it has memorable stories about the interactions of metaphysical principles cast as anthropomorphized (human-like) deities. The Wayist learns the deeper meanings as she internalizes the wisdom and relates how it plays out in the soul's transformation into a spiritual being.
### The Sumerian Text
Before we look at the oldest surviving text that describe the ontology (the branch of metaphysics that deals with the nature of being and origin of all that exist) of theWAY, lets remind ourselves how it was expressed 2,000 years later in the ancient Daodejing which was written in 500BCE, in China. Today, over 5,000 after it was first written, we still have it in our teaching as we see it in WAYISM: The Primary Teaching.
> **The Unfathomable One gives birth to Two.**\
> **Two gives birth to Three.**\
> **Three gives birth to all things.**
**Let's explain:**
Behind All, is the origin of all that is, a principle no human mind can conceive of nor speak to. We call it the THAT, or the Absolute, and then we keep silence. Wayists in other cultures speak of the Great Void, the Great No-thing --- then keep silence.
From the THAT proceeds the first principle which we can somewhat comprehend. In Sumerian it was called Nammu. We call it the One, or the Unfathomable One. The One is the Great Source of all energies. It is known to be like a great ocean of Divine Chaos of all energies.
Non-initiates to the esoteric meaning would believe 'the great ocean of Divine Chaos of all energies' was in fact an ocean of water --- and they built religions based on that belief.
The Sumerian text says the first thing that the Nammu (the One, the Source) did for creation as we know it, was to create space, and then fill that space with what we would today call something like a quantum foam, structures of quantum strands, upon which all of creation is build.
To fill space with the framework, the scaffolds, upon which all energies would play and create, the Source (Nammu) sent forth the Two.
The Two is a stream of bi-polar energy (Yin and Yang) which would be the essence of all that would exist in the universes known to us. All that exist in our perspective is a permutation of combinations of Yin and Yang energies.
The first major act of creation we know of is the creation of an energy structure within which metaphysical Laws lay down the way, the manner, in which all energies operate. This is necessary to structure the Chaos of Divine Energies --- to order, and lay down a plan, set the ways and means, the methods, in which the energies operate in the contained area.
This element of a way in which energies are used to create was brought about by the "loving play" of the cosmic male principle, the Yang, and the cosmic Female principle, the Yin. Therefore it is said the One motivated the Two to play, and from that play resulted the Three, the structure that organises The Way in which energies are ordered. We call the Three, The Way, because it is the Plan of our universe, the Method in which it flows, the Path of our universe and all who exist in it. As above, so below --- all things follow a simple, humble, and considerate Path and pattern, a set Way.
When we refer to the Three as a cosmic principle, we write it as The Way. When we speak to the teachings of the awareness of The Way and the path of humans, we write it as theWAY. However, not all languages use the roman alphabet, few use the -ism and -ist, so not all can use these devices to communicate. In most older cultures we still speak of People of The Way because they cannot say Wayists. The Wayist following of Lord Jesus were called people of The Way and in the Acts of the Apostles there are many references to that, and the teachings The Way upon which a Jew named Paul founded his Christian movement, a Judaic religious reformation movement that incorporates the Hebrew scriptures and their idea of the gods of their religion.
In China of \~500BCE, far removed from the Sumerian culture of 3,500BCE, we see our tradition relayed in books like theWAY of the Soul Mirror and Daodejing, as follows:
> **From the One comes the Two.**\
> **From the Two comes the Three.**\
> **From the Three, the ten thousand things.**
The most ancient text, written in Sumerian cuneiform, told the story of the birth of The Way, called EnLiL, in their language, in the following four lines:
**In the beginning there was Nammu, the primeval sea.**
**Nammu gave birth to An (which expanded as space) and Ki (which expanded as the material energies to fill space).**
**An and Ki mated with each other,**
**Causing Ki to give birth to Enlil.**
From the above it is clear: Nammu is the Source, An in Yang, Ki is Yin, and Enlil is The Way.
Interesting to note that in the name Enlil, the *lil* signifies the Intimate Divine Play of the energies. The *lil* is also at the root of the Sansktit word *leela*, play, which is said to be the play, the dance, of cosmic energies which create and uphold the universe. These philosophical concepts are as ancient as can be.
Religious people, however, cannot go with an impersonal creator principle, they must create Gods according to their image --- so teachings of theWAY never did suit their needs and was very unsatisfying to them.
The Sumerian teaching, having already spelled out the ontology of teaching of theWAY, was not done. It went further.
**Enlil, inheriting from his Father the An-nature, separated from An who took to himself all spirit space/sky.**
**With his An, and along with Ki, Enlil occupied his cosmos creating the Domains.**
**Enlil marries his mother, Ki, and from this union all material beings in the universe are born and have soul.**
From the above we learn here that soul is fundamentally a Yin / Ki-dominant energy, as experience and observation also attest.
We also learn that spiritual space is fundamentally Yang / An-dominant energy.
We learn that material beings who are alive, all have soul.
We also learn that Enlil, The Way, created his Domains. These Domains are the Domain of Spiritual Energy, the Domain of Soul Energy, the Domain of Material Energy, and then there is the principle of the Domain of the Underworld which is more of a principle of the flow of energy, as we will illustrate.
Let's dissect the basics of the original teaching in each line.
From the Sumerian triangle symbol of Enlil or theWAY, one would think it is the large Yang-energy triangle infused with the smaller Yin-energy triangle because that makes sense from the text. However, the ancients knew the full significance of The Way, is the SYSTEM which It embodies, within which all that exists, exists according to the Laws of metaphysics and physics that govern the way and method how things will play together.
Therefore, the System of theWAY is symbolized with the following, which is the topic of the following chapter:
6
## Symbol of The Way
Historians and archaeologists have overlooked the fact that the ancient symbol of The Way was universally used across various cultures and continents with no apparent connection or exchange. The primordial teaching of theWAY was present in even the most diverse ancient communities worldwide, including in Africa, Amazonia, the Andian, meso-America, the Mid-East, Western-Asia, and Southeast Asia.
The symbol of theWAY describes the Domains and the Laws of The Way. It also speaks to the flow of energies, from Source through all and then down to be recycled through the portal of the Underworld. In modern times, we see the flat two-dimensional symbol of The Way to indicate something like a toroidal shape.
The symbol, as we will show, is a mini catechism of the entire teaching.
The original symbol of theWAY is depicted with different decorations by the cultures that adopted it. We find the same design and meanings all over the world, each adding its own adaptations and embellishments. This chapter takes a brief tour of appreciation across the world to marvel at how the concept was adapted.
#### Here are the main elements:
1.  The foundation and Source of all is the inner hollow or vacancy --- the Nammu --- Source. One will recall many Wayist sayings about the utility of nothingness, the inner hollow that makes the cup useful, the spokes form the wheel, but the empty hub makes it useful.
2.  We have a 4-sided square, laid over a 4-armed cross --- the number 4 is a completeness, and solid foundation. The cross, the sign of potential because we choose which way to move, also the sign of movement or activity; also the sign of radiance of energy as was used for the sun. Therefore, the main symbol is made up of the two symbols, a square and a cross.
3.  We have a Domain on each of the four sides of the square. These are the Domains, each of which has its own separate space of existence. Energies from the domains may move about in Reality, but their home base is always the Domain whence they came and to which they return.\
    \
    - On top, we have Domain of Spirit Energy.\
    - Left is Domain of Material Energy.\
    - Right is Domain of Soul Energy .\
    - And below is Domain of the Underworld. We can consider the Domain of Underworld as a sub-domain of the Domain of Material Energy, as they are interconnected, but it is also the path of the outflow of all spent energies that must go for recycling --- more about this later.
4.  The twenty corners all around, symbolize the prevalence of the TWO: the Yin and Yang which flows from Source and permeates all.
The below image shows part of what we discuss in this book, the earliest writing of the origins of Wayist teaching, carved in stone on a Sumerian archeological find. Note the symbol of The Way.
Although the meaning and symbol portrayed above may appear sufficient, even flawless as far as logos go, humanity's innate creativity and fervor for the Purpose of Life and spirituality, drive us to make embellishments and improvements. Every culture would add their own distinct flavor or alter it in some way over the 5,000 years that followed.
Also, religions take hold of this simple philosophical frame and adorn it with their intricate tapestries, interpretations, and dogma, as we will demonstrate later. The once straightforward tale of wisdom about our cosmology gradually morphed into a complex web of soap opera episodes, complete with heavenly scandals and mysteries. While the theatrics initially contribute to the message's impact, wisdom eventually becomes obscured and fades from human consciousness. Then, the deities come to re-establish the message clearly, yet again.
Before mass communication technology on a planet, when teaching of theWAY was so obscured, spiritual beings had to take an incarnation to live among the people and debate the elders of the religions --- and pay the price (e.g. Lord Jesus and Lord Krishna).
### South America
The following versions of theWAY symbol were in use, already 1,000 years ago, in the Central and Southern Americas.
### India
The Way Symbol in India was called the Sri Yantra. It was in use at least 1,500 years ago already. The Sri Yantra represents the flow of energy in the universe. In Sanskrit, the usage of 'Sri' in such context means 'holy', while 'yantra' means 'instrument for releasing from bondage.'
The Bindu in the centre denotes the Source flowing from THAT of which we do not speak. From the vast expanse of the Void or Source, the energies of Yin and Yang flow outward, permeating all the Domains.
The upward pointing triangles symbolize Yang and the downward-pointing triangles symbolize Yin. The inner circle of 8 lotus leaves symbolizes Soul Energies, the circle of 12 lotus leaves symbolizes Spiritual Energies, and the two outer rings symbolize Material Energies (and some say also Domain of the Underworld).
### Other Variations
As more artistic versions appeared, adding decorative variations, we note early hints of the development of the swastika symbol. The symbol below represents a transitional stage. By keeping the square intact and incorporating the Yin & Yang triangles, the design captures the essence of fluid and balanced energies.
The symbol below comes from the Americas and has an interesting correspondence to what happened in other parts of the world. We remind the reader, as far as modern history knows, there was supposedly no communication between Mid-East and the New World Americas before the 17th century.
The decorative variation below comes from the Inca civilization before the arrival of colonizing Christian soldiers and Spanish culture.
The below variation below comes from the Mesopotamian culture. It shows a decorative design, a cut above the rest. The depiction on the flow of energies and the Yin-Yang opposites is unique.
From the pre-colonized Inca and earlier Mayan cultures, we see the bottom of the cross anchored to Earth where Domain of the Underworld is located.
These are the first people to illustrate an understanding of why Domain of the Underworld is depicted as apart, yet still part of Domain of Material Energies. The underworld spaces --- that which you discover when you dig for gold and deep below the forest floor, is a world apart from that which lies above the surface and what we see floating in the sky.
*(Notice how large in stature, the Annunaki-like figure compared to the Chief)*
The underworld teems with living things that are entirely different to living things above the skin of Earth, just as how animals are different inside compared to outside the skin.
That which lies beneath the ocean and the surface of Earth is a domain apart from what we know above the skin of Earth.
### Angkor Wat, Chichén Itzá, and other temples
Many ancient temples around the world were built in the shape of the symbol of The Way.
One example is the Wayist King Jayavarman VII of the Angkor Empire. His personal shrine, the Bayon Temple has this distinct layout.
The shape incorporated into the floor-plan is also seen in the main inner section of Angkor Wat, Bakong Temple, and the "Ladies Temple" of Bantea Srey, and several temples in India. The Mayan also used it, for example Chichén Itzá, and other. Also the Bokhur temple in Malaysia, and a few other in South East Asia.
### The Symbol as Toroid shape
The concept of the Underworld is an energy space thought to be like a "burial ground" where things are decomposed and their parts repurposed. There is great respect, nothing gross, for that part of Reality. The ancient's awareness of the importance of life in the soil and of the substance of Earth is remarkable, much more aware than what we exhibit in this day.
However, there is an additional component. They seem to have had a teaching that energies from into The Way from Source, and then flow out when used, to be recycled and come back again. The concept of the cycles and recycling, of course, is also seen in reincarnation of souls, the Law of Samsara, but this goes beyond that. In a way, it seems the ancients believed the "waste" energies flow into the Underground and come back again, in purified form, from Source.
We suggest the ancients would have been happy should we suggest they consider the flat graphic of the symbol can be better expressed as a toroidal shape. Although, we still cannot create a torus with three dimensions, still finding it hard to wrap our minds around it.
Today, we would like to imagine three toroids forming the symbol of The Way --- one toroid being Domain of Spirit Energy, another is the Domain of Soul Energy, and the third being the Domain of Material Energy. But we don't have the graphic ability to make a picture of it.

## Unlock the Esoteric
Let's elucidate the tip of the iceberg of the esoteric text. Our community site Wayist.Life features a more in-depth course on this topic.
1 Originally, there was only Nammu, the primeval sea.
2\. Then, Nammu gave birth to An (which expanded as space) and Ki (which expanded as the material cosmos).
3\. An and Ki mated with each other, causing Ki to give birth to Enlil.
4\. Enlil separated from An who took to himself all space/sky. And with Ki, Enlil occupied his cosmos creating the Domains.
5\. Enlil marries his mother, Ki, and from this union all material beings in the universe are born and have soul.
**Line 1:**
#### *Originally, there was only Nammu, the primeval sea*
Nammu is the SOURCE of all energy, the Divine Chaos, the Source which upholds the flow of all energies, and all that exists are energy structures.
Note, there is no talk of an Absolute, a Creator. We don't talk about THAT which lies behind Source, or most probably generates and upholds Source. We just don't know and cannot know. We know only Source.
The "primeval sea" is space, the expanse, which is then filled with the quantum foam, or quantum soup, from the energy presence of Nammo --- the Source. The soul religions that built upon this philosophical foundation misunderstood the concept of "primeval sea" and understood it as water. But People of theWAY know the spiritual teaching which we discuss here.
**Line 2:**
#### *Then, Nammu gave birth to An (which expanded as space) and Ki (which expanded as the material cosmos).*
An is primordial Yang energy. It expands ahead of all creation to create space in the "primeval sea". Once space is created, An and Ki follow to fill space with Yang and Yin creative potential.
All energy structures that exist (muon, electron, galaxy, etc.) are coded to be, as they all are made of the binary energies, Yin and Yang. And once they exist, they float in that primordial sea.
However, to create there must be a mind that acts on the Yang and Yin in the primordial fluid. Mind is the creative principle, and all that is created and upheld, every nanosecond, was and is by the will of a cosmic mind principle.
***How are energy structures coded?***
> *Yin and Yang are binary, but with divine sophistication. Like the flip and spin of electrons, the yin and yang interact. One can mix yin and yang ratios infinitely along the scales. So how does one write computer code with energy flows that are binary in nature but infinite degrees of each? We don't know how energy structures are coded. Writers hereof don't even know how to code Javascript. Nonetheless, we feel compelled to share this for someone better qualified to consider and reflect upon.*\
> \
> *Consider this. The following are a number of 2D diagrams of multidimensional structural forms, or scaffolds, which are in fact (in our musing) code snippets for building blocks in the universe. These are the Forms made available by Source. These Forms are the basis upon which all creations are created.*
> *String these snippets along in your code to build an electron. Remember that each emits an aura which interacts with its neighbor snippet --- there's input and feedback. Every energy structure, even sub-structures, operates in a toroid "container".*
> *Now that you have cracked the code, you can use the binary energies of Yin and Yang, which can, by being tuned to various intensities in the mix build your electron.*
> *Make that electron a snippet and string them around the proton that you made in yesterday's workshop. You have created an atom of your own design. Thank God you are limited by the Laws of Material Energy Domain, so you don't blow up the lab too frequently.*\
> \
> *Each of your energy structures, once formed, creates a group mind with self-identity, a sense of purpose, and a will to function according to design. An energy structure can be coded so it will fuse with another, and become part of something more powerful.*\
> \
> *The computer we animals use to code is called a Mind. Almost every living being creates. Humans have 10 very powerful minds: 3 soul minds, 4 spirit minds, and 3 biological body minds (more about this later). In our spirituality, we refer to our minds as chakras. By using our minds, we create not only material realities and amazing inventions (like pizza with anchovies), but also immaterial or metaphysical realities and energy structures like desires, passions, emotions, thoughts, needs, knowledge in storage, wisdom, and so on.*\
> \
> *Does this all mean we are living in a simulation? No, it does not. This is reality. A simulation would be if you hold fast to a different idea of reality, as a beetle bug does, and now see that this here idea of reality "simulates" yours. If you suffer from simulatitis, it's easy to fix. Use your power of Attitude to switch your brain-mind around to understand all things as energy structures.*
> *Everything is energy. And whenever you catch yourself thinking anything is solid matter, or that something does not exist because you cannot see it or measure it, give yourself a good whack on the side of the head. Later, when you go for your brain-shake MRI, take note of how the energy you cannot see in that machine will produce a visible image of your bruised brain, along with a tangible bill for the clinic.*

**At this time, in Line 2 of the Sumerian text, there is no other mind in the cosmology.**
A mind is needed to act on the materials of creation to create something. Therefore, as we see in Line 3, The Way is created as one particular "divine mind" principle (there may be others, we don't know). That is why The Way is described in Greek traditions as a Logos. Logos means word, or the concrete expression of a mental process. Mind expressed, is the Word. The concept of the Divine Word is also captured in the OM principle of Vedantic traditions. It acts on the materials of creation to create all that is in theWAY.
**Line 3:**
#### *An and Ki mated with each other,* *causing Ki to give birth to EnLil.*
EnLil is the Sumerian for what we call theWAY.
The mating is called Lil, which is reminiscent of the Sanskrit Leela, which means playful, joyful, loving action. This is reminiscent of the dance of Shiva which creates the cosmos. Lil or Leela is the play of the mind upon creative materials which brings about the birth of their child, EnLil. The first part of the name En means Lord, God or Master. The Way is described as God of Lil / Leela.
Play, joy, and sensuousness is inherent in theWAY. We play here amidst plentiful amazing energies, most of which we cannot see or feel, but they interact with what we have, and we on them. Life is supposed to be active, fun, and joyful.
### An
The Cuneiform symbol for An is descriptive of how Yang energy is directive, simple, and concrete. Therefore, say the ancients, An is the primordial male of Creative Powers.
Not only do we learn much about An in earliest Mesopotamia, but the concept is taught also in ancient China and India as well. For example, 3,500 years ago already, Vedic texts from India described this principle as *akasha* because it is the first creative principle of space. It is found in Jain, Hinduism and Buddhist texts. Source used An to make Akasha (space filled with primordial quantum "foam" or "sea"). Akasha can attenuate or limit some of its characteristics to create space limitations and different kinds of space.
Ancients, who had no scientific knowledge, said An is the attribute of sound (vibrations and frequencies), it is all pervading and infinite but can make pockets of toned-down finite space, it is imperceptible and creates minute "space points" that help basic energies move and communicate. At its lowest pure manifestation is where the abode of spirit heavens exists. It is the main essence of spirit and spiritual beings. It is the dominant energy of our Sahasara Chakra.
### Ki
The Cuneiform symbol for Ki is descriptive of how Ki is female, Yin energy, the primordial female of Creative Powers. She has many dimensions. She has the dark side. In Chinese lore she represents the shady side of the hill, and An, the sunny side of the hill.
Ki predominates in cold, cool, dark and closed-ness. She reigns-in the loose flying atoms with gravity and instilling in them a sense of purpose. Because of her, we can have energy structures appear to us as if "solid matter." As the Mother of Creative energies, yin energy is supporting and nurturing. She instills sophistication and discipline in her children (creations, quantum elements, atoms, cells, organisms, and galaxies). She sets the gluon, and she holds us in gravity where needed. It is she, they say, who is the dark side of the Void, the Abyss where nothingness (nothing created) is the true reality. This nothingness, の (mu) in Japanese, is the subject of the Wayist Prajnaparamita Sutra.
As we will see in the Sumerian text, and as teaching of theWAY always taught, Ki (yin) predominates in soul energies, and An (yang) predominates in spiritual energies. Ki is dominant in physics and An in metaphysics. An is dominant is consciousness and Ki in mental energy. Ki is dominant in knowledge and An is dominant in wisdom. Ki is dominant in love and An is dominant in compassion.
Ki is dominant in sensuousness and passions like compassion, and An in the wisdom derived from self-craft resulting from the experience.
#### About EnLil, The Way
To recap Line 3:
> *An and Ki mated with each other, causing Ki to give birth to Enlil.*
Enlil is a masculine name. In this most ancient of languages, Sumerian, it has two parts: *En* and *LiL*. *En* is a designation with the meaning of "In the image of" or "personification of." The word *LiL* means the play and movement of Primeval Energy or Spirit. Therefore, EnLil means "In the image of Primeval Spirit".
The energy of The Way is different to the potential energy held in An and Ki. This is the first Universal Energy created by the interactions of An and Ki. This is the first energy structure and mind principle produced by them, which is sent out to exist in its own right.
The term LiL is also used for things the ancients knew were there, but could not understand it, or predict its movement or direct it, and cannot pin down. Remember, they had no concept of energy, which came thousands of years later. They thought of it as 'powers', like the power of wind and water.
LiL is often used for a breeze or wind. They could speak of an inner breeze we feel when moved in mystical awareness of the presence of the divine, a spirit. They observed that an inner breeze has the potential to transform into a hurricane when we are aroused. Their observation highlighted the similarity in how the skin reacts to both an external breeze and an internal breeze, when the spirit makes contact with us internally. They noted how the hairs on our neck react when we sense a soul or spiritual energy in our aura (this is because Vishuddhi chakra does that work).
They noted how the wind brings rain and life, and the inner breeze in the plants brings rejuvenation and a sense of fulfillment. For the general populace who did not yet understand spirit for what it is, this root concept of breeze/wind equated with spirit translated to later languages as well. The word for spirit remained an enigma, just as it is today for junior students on the Path. It was associated with sky, space, heaven; and wind or breeze was its movement. Many ages later than the Sumerian, in ancient Greek, the word *pneuma* which means air and wind, was also used for spirit. The word for soul was *psyche* (from where we get psychology).
In the Bible, Lord Iesous uses the Koine Greek word *pneuma* twice in one sentence, once for wind and then for spirit: "The wind blows where it wants, and you hear the sound thereof, but cannot tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the spirit."
When pure Yin and pure Yang stood apart after their birth, there was no creation as yet, because they stood only as potentials of all energies. It was during the LiL, when they interacted with one another, that their potential created an energy entity that stood in its own right, The Way.
Enlil was the only begotten child of An and Ki. He has a male name because he is more An than Ki. He was conceived because of the LiL, the energies created by the sensuous play between the original first created energies in the universes. Therefore, his name means Personification of the Primordial Energies, because he has executive creative powers and qualities of source energies.
Enlil embodies the qualities of his Father and Mother Yin and Yang. However, Enlil is a masculine entity in that he has more yang than yin. He takes after his Father. Therefore, he lacks Ki to be balanced. The imbalance makes him so very directive and active.
Balance is still.
Being An dominant, we know Enlil has an executive function, it is an active, creative, invigorating, force. We know it must fulfill its function, as all things created are driven to fulfill their function and purpose.
Enlil is not Source, but personifies the movement and flow of the way of Source energies. He personifies theWAY, which is the manner, the mode, the intent, and path of the part of creation in which we exist. The Way is the way things flow. It is the way it will be. There is no other way in The Way. The religious person can use language like, The Way is the Plan of the Creator. We won't use that language because we know that The Way is a massive metaphysical energy structure with Mind that forwards the Word, the OM, which creates and upholds all of creation within its Realm --- which is the multiverse we are aware of.
**The original cuneiform for The Way is :**
The term LiL (the last two characters). It is evidently a multifaceted concept marked by movement and establishment. It mixes elements of yang and yin, and has four main elements in it, or four domains.
The Way is the closest we can get to being aware of Source in our being. Therefore, People of theWAY know that far beyond brain-consciousness lies the true insight, and that is in spiritual awareness. Awareness is the height of the spiritual quest. When the brain becomes lame or dies, consciousness, which is mostly a lower-self faculty, extinguishes along with its memories and skills. What remains with us are soul maturity, and the skills of spirit-minds and its wisdom.
Awareness of the Divine is our highest faculty. Through this journey, assisted by teaching of tWAYwe merge with The Way and receive the embrace of the deities, who bestow wisdom upon us while we experience the heavenly ecstasy and the magnificent Peace. According to Sumerian writings, Enlil himself was so holy that not even the gods could look upon him.
This is because all the gods are creatures who exist in The Way. If one had to ask a deity, "what is your nature" it would answer: I am The Way, I am in The Way, and The Way is in me.
The text tells us it is through theWAY teaching how our cosmos, which is our group of galaxies, came about. It is through The Way that the Butterfly Path exists for soul beings to learn to become spiritual beings, or to be "born of the spirit" or be "born again," as Lord Iesous said. Because of The Way, our Path is a predefined, already flowing process. Because you are here, you are flowing in it. It flows as it must and will, because it is so determined by The Way, it is the way things are and will be.
> *In light of the above, it is noteworthy that the term "way" is most often a feminine noun. The Way is a manner, a method, a principle within which things flow according to the manner prescribed. It is definitely a feminine (yin) principle. Yet, in spirituality, we know The Way is a Yang-energy dominant principle. Why would this be?*\
> *Line 5 of the Sumerian text sheds light on the dichotomy. It is because Ki joins Enlil in creating The Way, and she gives life to three of the Domains in The Way. The life-giving principle in The Way is feminine, and the organizational principle is male in nature.*\
> \
> *It is for this reason Lord Jesus says in the ancient Koine Greek which he spoke: "****Ἐγώ eimi hē hodos****" which translates to "I am The Way" in English. The Lord used the feminine article "hē" before Way.*
> *Every thing that exists has both Yin and Yang.*
**In the next line, we see how our cosmos came about.**
Line 4:
#### Enlil separated An from Ki and took to himself the cosmos as his domain, while An took to himself the sky.
An and Ki came together to create Enlil. Their creation then existed as a separate entity, existing as a massive energy structure which floats in the quantum field of Source energies.
Enlil is shielded from pure An and pure Ki by its containment within a toroidal container. A container is necessary for any energy structure that is formed, like an energy body created by its own energies. So too the human. We see the principle active in nature and cosmology.
An entity moves away as an individual. It contains in itself both An and Ki energies. For that entity (whether a fermion or galaxy), time begins and will end as befits its purpose. Every type of creature has its own sense of time.
Universal time is simply the motion (or flow) of the substrate of Source energy within which space is created.
For any and every energy structure (whether a fermion or galaxy), time begins and ends as befits its purpose. Time is relative to the design of the energy structure. Human time is how we define it.
The family of the deceased gastrotrich who died at the age of 36 human-time hours grieves her loss, stating that God took her prematurely; she could have lived for another 12 human-time hours and die of old age. The human red blood cell has a full and meaningful life, and dies of old age after 4 human-time months. An electron and proton is theoretically immortal and will probably last for at least 66,000 human-time yottayears, which is about five-quintillion times the current age of the EnliL (The Way). This means that electrons do not decay into lighter particles, such as photons and neutrinos. However, they can be annihilated by their antiparticles, positrons, or absorbed by other particles, such as protons.
For the person of theWAY, the smallest energy structure is an elementary particle; it has its own sense of time and limitation on its lifespan. It has its own sense of purpose and duty to fulfill it. It has its own ego, its own sense of self, which it wants to protect and hold on to its form. It has its own sense of wanting to attach to, or marry, or become one with a larger whole, for a higher purpose. This goes for elementary particles, organisms, energies of physics, humans, and galaxies.
Therefore, The Way is an energy structure, the first self-conscious massive intelligent energy structure in the universe. It is the most divine energy structure that we can understand and somehow relate to because we can sense its energy flows.
The Way, therefore, is a third-level energy manifestation from Source: "*From the One came the Two, from the Two came the Three."* The Way embodies the Divine Triad.
From here, comes the concept that the God of our cosmos embodies a Divine Trinity. Later religions would do their own thing with the concept, but we know what the ancient teaching intended.
The Way, being a created energy structure, a creature, exists in a domain in space made available by Source. All created things exist in the confines of their own encapsulation, which can include purpose or character, but also place. The text says the domain of The Way is our known mulriverse. We say multiverse because we understand not only the material structures of Domain of Material Energy, but also the interconnected and adjacent (in energy proximity) domains of Spirit and Soul energies.
The Way, being yang-dominant, needs a yin-dominant partner to create and sustain organic beings and material things. For this, The Way pairs with pure Yin to create and sustain the soul worlds and biological life. Together, The Way and Ki employ intelligent design to create and sustain all life in our cosmos.
Teaching of theWAY nowadays suggests that \"our\" cosmos, as taught by the elders, could potentially be limited to our group of galaxies. Additionally, it is also conceivable to consider that other structures like The Way exist, each with its own, perhaps unique, multiverse.
But, alas, that type of thinking is just intellectual entertainment and of zero consequence to how you will deal with the actual issues, like your next meal and your endeavor to maintain your sense of wellbeing.
**Line 5:**
#### *Enlil marries his mother, Ki, and from this union all the plant and animal life on earth is produced.*
Biological, natural, and physical energy structures are mostly yin dominant. To create those, Enlil interacts with his mother, Ki. Her Yin energy and his Yang energy will flow through all creations in his domains. He becomes the Father of our *cosmos*, and the primordial Mother of Creative Energies partners with us, exists in us, is what makes us alive; provides living souls.
Because Ki gives not herself but only her affinity as helpmeet in marriage to Enlil, it is not the primordial Ki that is present, only her devotion. Therefore, in the whatever exists in theWAY, Ki is worshipped since the founding of modern humans as Mammi, Mamma, Womb Goddess, Midwife of the gods, Mother of all children and Mother of the gods, and several other titles denoting fertility, nurturing, and creation. She is honored as the essence of plants, animals, our food, soil, and human bodies. In our cosmos, Enlil is said to be the essence of air. And in water, and in blood the mix of Ki and Enlil is equal.
From this point forward, we see many diverse mythologies developed in many nations about how Enlil populated our cosmos. He creates Three Energy types and for each their own source domain: Matter, Spirit, and Soul energies. In Material Domain Enlil creates suns, moons, and planets. From soul Domain comes souls to give life to creatures that live in material structures. In the spirit domain are heavens and spiritual beings who work to maintain all energies in all three domains.
#### And then things become obscured
In terms of what happened with the received text, things get increasingly complex over the ensuing ages as the religions wove upon the simple Wayist frame, adding unique colors and flavors to their tapestries, mixing in their own mythology, culture and language, and marrying it with their folk religions.
In the original teaching, each metaphysical energy and physical mechanism created becomes personified as yet another god or goddess. This was a way for junior souls and unscientific minds to make sense of things. For example, the sun god and moon god had children, whom we will discuss later because they are important for this essay. Only the Wayist knows those two children represent soul minds, chakras, and speak to our inward journey and challenges on the Butterfly Path.
They made gods for all powerful forces in nature, and unexplained winds / spirits in ourselves. Because junior souls could not understand the spirit and spirit minds, they blamed strong human energies on the outside interference of demons and gods. They created gods of love, war, water, music talent, and arts. There are guardian deities and spirit guides, as well as deviant souls that become demons.
Wayists know what they call demons and devils are soul deities, or disembodied soul beings that are not anymore on the Butterfly Path, but want in to live in your body. Even our teaching of metaphysical principles, they made into gods. They created a god of duty (dharma, by another name), a god of judgement (karma by another name), and a god of illusion who keeps truth from those who are not ready for it (maya, by another name).
> Natural forces also became gods, like thunder, storms, rain, and wind.
Religions formed around the gods they created, and more cultural colors and adornments were added to their tapestries. Religions were politicized and weaponized, and they fought wars in their names. For example, there were wars fought between the followers of the gods El, E'l, Eloha, and Elo, yet all derived from linguistic variants of the original concept, Enlil. By way of example: the Bible speaks of its God by the names El, Eloha, and Elohim (in the plural), yet the God commanded his people to genocide the neighboring nations because they use a different god name.
It is too overwhelming for junior human souls to accept that Enlil is a metaphysical principle beyond human comprehension. Consequently, they attribute human characteristics, emotions, desires and needs to the WAY and treat it as their deity, believing it to be only slightly more advanced than themselves.
And that is how it must be. Junior students need gods like that.
#### **The Three Domains**
**Recap of Line 4:**
Enlil separated An from Ki and took to himself the cosmos as his domain, while An took to himself the sky.
The Way separates from the Primordial father, Primordial Yang, as a son who leaves his father's house to strike out on his own, yet has the father's qualities inherent.
The Way creates his cosmos. It has three energy domains. Each domain has its own metaphysical laws, structure, and mechanisms to ensure it works as planned.
In the next line, we see The Way works with Ki (Yin) the Primordial Mother to co-create his cosmos, and provide living souls to inhabit material structures. Each living being becomes a co-creator. They create ideas, housing, adapting, evolving, tools, relationships, community, communications, etc.
Think not only about beings on Earth, but at least think Galaxy-wide, and inside organic bodies, and underground. The number of intelligent soul-beings in the galaxy exceed the number human brains can comprehend.
> **The Three Domains are three distinct types of energy.**
#### Domain of Material Energy
**Domain of Material Energy is what human scientists** are learning about in their work with the Electromagnetic Spectrum, the Standard Model, and the endeavors of quantum mechanics. This is also the domain in which we live in human bodies to experience this reality. We learn how different beings experience the energies of this domain differently. What is a gas for some is like a fluid to others, is undetectable to another. What is a solid for some is as if porous to others, is a world of many species and communities to another. That which is an insightful thought or a heartfelt emotion to some, are but two different types of energy generated by two different mind states to others, is an impenetrable wall to another. What is "real", here, is relative only to the mind of the experiencer. What gives something meaning here is the subjective perception of the individual experiencing it---you decide the meaning of things.
For many, this is the world of illusions.
#### The Underworld
**The Underworld is a sub-domain** of Domain of Material Energy. All Domains have multiple sub-domains but The Underworld is so massive and important, it deserves its own space in the study of cosmology.
According to our understanding, beneath the surface of planets lies a separate cosmos with unique living entities and hierarchies. The Underworld is below the surface, under the skin of planets and in its oceans, seas, and lakes of whatever liquid. The Underworld of any planet is a universe different to the universe hung in space up above. For any creature living on a planet, the Underworld is of higher importance and significance to what happens in the sky above the planet. For Yang-type explorers, the allure lies in discovering the secrets that await in the far reaches. Those with a Yin-type mindset are drawn to investigate the wonders of their nearby environment. Seeking wisdom from the Underworld requires a mature and balanced approach.
Soul beings incarnate to Domain of the Underworld and form all sorts of communities, hierarchies, and domains.
Mythology also says that it is to Domain of the Underworld where willfully abusive souls incarnate to get opportunities to reform themselves, and if not, they will eventually be dismantled by the "Queen of the Underworld" where they are stripped of all qualities, then declared, "You are dead". Many myths surrounding this process abounded in the millennia following the revelation of our text.
Most planets in the universe are containers for life, both simple and highly advanced. Few planets have beings living on the surface of the container.
#### Domain of Soul Energies
**The Domain of Soul Energies serves as the birthplace** and sanctuary for soul beings, offering them a haven when they are not occupying physical vessels. They have their own heavens (sub-domains). When we speak of heaven, we are referring to a transcendent space where a specific group or species of beings dwell. Each soul type or species has their own unique heavens that cater to their needs.
The mortality of soul beings is a fundamental aspect of their existence. Souls, when in material bodies, can multiply by procreating and bringing new souls into existence. When the ovum of an animal is fertilized, it releases a vibrant energy seed that ignites the creation of a new soul unique to its species. A resemblance emerges as we consider the presence of a spirit seed in our Anahata mind and the subsequent formation of a new spirit with divine characteristics.
The rulers of soul heavens are soul deities. They are Gods to soul beings. Advanced soul beings are tribal and religious by nature. When souls first come to Butterfly Path for a human experience, they have a natural inclination towards religion. It is natural for the soul to feel safe when their God is protective of their clan and has the means and temerity to annihilate their enemies. They know Gods need to be reminded you know they are all powerful and all-wise. The religions serve them well until they are mature enough to embrace the deities of spirit heaven, which is where we are destined when we follow the purpose of being on Butterfly Path.
Incorporeal soul beings are frequently called ghosts and demons in human language, sometimes incorrectly referred to as spirits. Junior students on the Path are not skilled at differentiating between souls and spirits. This is because of cultural conditioned thinking, on one hand. The main reason, however, is because they cannot attune to the energy of spirit beings to experience, or sense, the difference.
That is why they can use flawed terms like "evil spirit," a concept that has no basis in reality. The essence of a spiritual being precludes any possibility of evil. Their inherent nature and intentional design make them naturally inclined towards benevolence. Soul beings might view them as "evil" because spirit beings sometimes obstruct their plans, but at their core, spirit beings are always well-intentioned.
Human souls acknowledge soul beings of immense power as gods or angels. And may mistakenly refer to them as spiritual entities.
Souls that are destined to be incarnated as humans on the Butterfly Path must undergo a journey through Paradise, a transitional realm where they undergo preparation and processing. The prepared soul is designated to fetuses during the period of 20 to 24 weeks, marking the commencement of incarnation. As previously mentioned, every soul that is prepared for the Butterfly Path will be equipped with an Anahata Mind, alongside their spiritual potential.
Under certain circumstances, a soul that has been denied entry to Butterfly Path may bypass Paradise and inhabit a human fetus. Those souls will seek out a mother whose soul resonates with their own, utilizing that resonance to enter the fetus prior to Paradise's attempt to implant a soul. The vagabond soul assumes occupancy within the fetus, impeding the embodiment of a soul from Paradise.
Souls that don't pass through Paradise before incarnating as humans, lack the Anahata chakra and aren't on the Butterfly Path.
We discuss the important concept of Paradise in Chapter 10.
#### Domain of Spiritual Energies
The Domain of Spiritual Energies consists of multiple celestial realms that act as abodes for various kinds of spiritual entities. The Way is the fundamental source from which spiritual beings are created. These individuals are eternal beings, the majority of whom have been present in our universe since its inception at the start of theWAY.
We are a distinct form of spiritual entity that emerges through the evolutionary progression of the soul. The only way for a soul being to attain spiritual growth is through enrollment in the School of Divinity for Soul Beings, commonly referred to as the Butterfly Path on earth.
Every heavenly realm is governed by a regent, commonly referred to as the supreme ruler. The regent is supported by key personnel who oversee the operations of the heaven and its ministry. Each one serves a distinct purpose and holds significance within the framework, guaranteeing the smooth operation of metaphysical mechanisms.
In present-day human language, the term "deities" is frequently used to refer to spiritual beings. The terminology we employ includes buddhas (the wise ones), gods, angels, taras, and bodhisattvas.
Junior students on the Path struggle to distinguish between an advanced soul entity and a spiritual entity.
Spiritual beings are energy workers. Their responsibility lies in managing the flows and connections of the energies in theWAY. Want to call them Energy Engineers, or Divine Code Patchers? It's probably more than that, but something we can wrap our minds around. They are accountable for THEWAY-net, the Intelligence Infrastructure and software upgrades, as far as we can surmise.
The primary focus of spiritual workers within our particular species is different. It is to assist advanced incarnated souls throughout the universe. Advanced souls can be challenging to deal with due to their inclination towards seeking power and being selfish, forming tribes, hoarding resources, and dominating weaker beings. When large groups assume control of planetary systems, there is a potential for significant negative consequences. Such groups have the capacity to inflict extensive harm upon the energy ecology and potentially even lead to the extinction of soul-beings. Our specialization revolves around the intricate energies of soul-minds and the interconnectedness of inter-soul relationships.
Our primary role is to offer assistance in matters of interpersonal nature, whereas other spiritual entities are responsible for the maintenance of 'energy network systems'.

## No Absolute, no Creator God
> Line 1: Originally, there was only Nammu, the primeval sea.
In the intricate tapestry of Wayist cosmology, a profound truth emerges: there is no mention of an Absolute Power or an Absolute Creator God overseeing all of existence. This absence is not an oversight, but a deliberate acknowledgment of the limits of human comprehension. We, as Wayists, recognize that the concept of THAT which lies beyond our understanding, is so vast, so incomprehensible, that we dare not speak of it or attempt to enumerate it as a creative principle in our worldview.
To anthropomorphize THAT --- to ascribe human qualities, needs, or personality to it --- would be a grave misconception. Such an act would only serve to diminish the unfathomable nature of the ultimate reality that lies beyond our grasp.
For the Wayist, this understanding brings with it a profound humility. We recognize our place in creation as beings of little cosmic significance, occupying a minuscule space within a universe --- indeed, a multiverse --- teeming with energy beings, energy structures, and governed by metaphysical Laws and Laws of Physics far beyond our full comprehension.
This perspective leads us to a crucial realization: the human species holds no greater significance than any other beings in this vast cosmic dance. While we may take comfort in knowing that graduation from the Butterfly Path offers us the opportunity to become helper beings, making a difference in the lives of others, this potential 'specialness' is limited in scope.
Yes, we may be considered "chosen ones" in the sense that we applied for and were granted admission to this School of Divinity for Souls. However, this selection does not elevate us above the intricate web of organic and energy ecologies we share with countless other beings.
True understanding of our place in this vast sea of apparent insignificance can only come through the cultivation of humbleness, gratitude, simplicity, and compassion. It is through these qualities that we may find a path to make our lives truly significant, not by claiming superiority or central importance, but by harmonizing with the grand symphony of existence.
In embracing this perspective, we open ourselves to the profound beauty and mystery of our cosmic journey, finding meaning not in grandiose claims of importance, but in the simple acts of kindness, growth, and interconnectedness that define the Wayist path.
Consequently, the Sumerian text begins with Nammu, also known as the "sea of energy," which is commonly identified as the One or the fundamental wellspring of existence. But even this One we cannot comprehend. The pot faces impossibility to fathom the Potter.
It is conceivable that our understanding is limited when considering the possibility of an Energy Principle being the primary architect of space.
You need space before you can put something in it. And that is what Nammu, or the Source did. It creates space and then the quantum structure to let things "float" or be suspended in the space.
It is possible to consider that the capacity of the human brain may be insufficient to grasp the concept of an Energy Entity which permeates Space with a "foam" or "sea" of potential creative energy, thereby establishing the space and framework in which multiple universes can exist.
Nammu is, or creates, a sort of quantum foam or "sea" akin to modern science's theories of a quark-gluon plasma or Bose-Einstein condensate, we thinks. Nevertheless, Wayists writers should refrain from employing the terminology of physics they are unfamiliar with, in a field that even scientists don't yet understand. My qualification to have written that line above stems from being an owner of a Bose noise-cancelling headset adorned with a glue-on label. Let's keep to our skillset and speak only of metaphysics and philosophy, and lived human experiences.
Akasha is the ancient Sanskrit term for the equivalent concept of Nammu. Nothing created can exist outside of, or apart from, Akasha or Nammu. In modern western spirituality, we use the word Source, or the One, to speak to the concept --- which stems from Socrates and Plato.
In the Sumerian line that follows this one, we see the creation of Space and then Energy.
All space exists because of Nammu.
Now we have it: from Nammu (Source) flows energy, which creates space. Space is filled with a "sea" of a web of Nammu energy in which everything that is placed in it will 'float'.
What happens next is, Nammu flows from within itself the Primordial Creative Energies, Ki (Yin) and An (Yang).
Yin and Yang simply exist. By themselves, they don't create but are the creative energies, that which creates and sustains the building blocks of all that exist. Think of the fundamentals of material creation --- then take it further and think of an emotion that is yang dominant, and another which is yin dominant --- thin of souls, they are yin dominant, and spirits, they are yang dominant. Yin and Yang do not create but exist as the very fiber of all that is created, manifest and unmanifest. Their constant flow and ubiquitous presence, is what makes all things in The Way possible.
Now we have the Space and in it the "Sea" of the framework upon which to act, for things to be created. Something must act upon the creative infrastructure and its elements. What is the agent of creation? It is mind.
We need a mind, an idea, a plan, for a design, then put that concept into code like a Logos (Word, OM) energy to start the process of creating.
Almost every energy structure with a mind, is a creator. Almost every energy structure has a mind. Think of the diatom, its mind helps it create its ideals and offspring. Diatoms are truly microscopic marvels of nature. To grasp just how small these vital organisms are, consider this: on the period at the end of this sentence, you could fit approximately 2,000 average-sized diatoms side by side. If you were to take a typical pinhead, which is already quite small to the naked eye, you could arrange about 50,000 diatoms on its surface.
To put it another way, if you were to enlarge a diatom to the size of a penny, a human being on the same scale would tower over Mount Everest, standing at about 5.5 miles tall.
Yet despite their minuscule size, diatoms are powerhouses of the aquatic world. These single-celled algae are responsible for producing about 20-50% of the oxygen we breathe and form the base of many aquatic food chains. They're a prime example of how, in nature, size doesn't always correlate with importance. These tiny organisms play a crucial role in Earth's ecology, demonstrating that even the smallest entities can have an enormous impact on the world around them.
Most creators are also destroyers. The beaver, politician, and white-spotted pufferfish create beautiful things, but they have another side as well. We all eat, and modify the creations of others.
The group-mind, which forms from all the little minds of cells, as a plant increases in size, becomes all the more wise and strong in energy output. The minds in the forest act on Creative Principle to make things, or to dismantle things and rearrange them. And so does the group-mind of your community create its own reality and karma, of which you are a partaker --- passive or active.
All energy exists as a product of Nammu, the Source. The electron and photon move along the omnipresent sea of Nammu which fills all space.
Any attribute of energy presence, like spiritual energy, for example, moves along in the Nammu field.
All that exists, moves, therefore all that exists move in the Nammu field or "sea" in space. All that exists, exists in this primordial sea. All that exists is energy, and moves.
The Wayist believes that the Nammu, along with its origin and mechanisms, will remain an unknown to humankind.
The ancients identified the Source as the Abyss. In the Far East, it was known as the Void, and certain Buddhists preferred to refer to it as the Emptiness. In the Prajnaparamita Sutra, we name it as the Void, affirming that "from the Void, all things manifest and merge back".
The prevailing notion suggests that Source, as well as theWAY and most large structures and mechanisms such as our chakra-minds, exist as a toroidal shape. Within the toroidal shape, the center is occupied by a void.
In the case of Source, the Void, the Mu, functions as the origin of all energy which it flows out on one side, while on the other side, it serves as a recycling mechanism wherein spent structures are drawn in to be disassembled into quantum building blocks for subsequent reuse within the System.
We are in favor of the idea, as we observe and sense the toroidal shape within our chakra-minds and aura, aligning with that notion.
Nevertheless, we are quick to acknowledge our lack of understanding and, most importantly, how unimportant it is to understand any of this. In fact, this entire book is quite unnecessary --- we write and read it because we are inquisitive, just because we can. Mental gymnastics serve only as entertainment. Let's put entertainment aside for now --- it does not serve the spiritual quest.
Reflecting on the received wisdom of the ancients, Plato asked, (we paraphrase) "What then is the Prime Mover? What triggered in the Nammu that first act of creation?"
"Certainly," said Plato, "That is the Prime Mover of all creation". Plato wants to call his Prime Mover, the One --- the Singularity. The Wayist says no --- "How can you know that Plato? How can you humans decide to ascribe to the Absolute a quality? Why, Plato, do you think 'One' is so special when your people have not even discovered the utility of Zero, and you will not, for at least another 700 years" Had you known about Zero, would you not have thought maybe 0 is the better because it is the mysterious void for us, because it is indivisible, and you cannot divide anything by it, cannot multiply by it. It is the ultimate number to represent the Absolute, the THAT. You westerners are all so category obsessed, definition crazy, assigning values, labelling and naming, grouping --- lego maniacs. Why? Now you want to categorize, name, place a value on the Absolute -- oh! Go get a coffee and sit down.
In a different part of the world, also during the era of Plato and LaoTzi (\~600BC), the Upanishads emerged as a compendium of the ancient Vedas, a source of philosophical thought for its people. Interestingly, they seem to respond to the same question that Socrates, Aristotle and Plato asked by asserting that "THAT" is the ultimate force behind the universe. All we can know or say is THAT is the Absolute, the Prime Mover of the universe. It is THAT which triggered the now waning idea of western science's idea of a Big Bang which they so violently forced upon us who dared doubt them.
The well-known saying of the Upanishad goes: *Tat Tvam Asi* which translates as, Thou Art That. We, and all, come from That and we and all exist in THAT but we cannot and do not speak to THAT.
Mainstream religions have always known for sure the THAT which is behind the Great Unknown Source, the Void of Wayism, is their Creator God who is male, who has emotions and emotional needs, and He created humans as the most intelligent beings in the entire universe to worship Him. And all humans who don't believe in the particular tribal notion of Him, will be tortured by Him for eons.
Wayists of old have always said this Absolute, the Prime Mover and its Nammu is incomprehensible and unfathomable. We should not speak to it, because any word we say about it will place limitations and attributes on it, and we are not qualified to do that. Even saying It is "good" suggests that something else exists outside of it which is not good. Who the heck are we to an opinion about whether the Nammu or theWAY measures up to our standards of ethics and morals, of what is good or beautiful? What do we know about good and bad? Hence, it is advisable that we maintain our silence.
Shift your focus to matters where we *can* make a difference, like expressing our gratitude to a friend through a warm smile, hug a cow, or feed a raccoon some kitchen scraps.
We lack the qualifications to discuss the metaphysical forces which govern our existence. The clay does not argue the potter. It would be preferable if we directed our attention towards enhancing ourselves, thereby achieving the desired outcome of the purpose of life. Instead of indulging in intellectual distractions about abstract notions impossible to comprehend, let us delve into introspection and dedicate ourselves to the arduous process of self-improvement and spiritual development --- a science and skill so few people have yet mastered.

## God Our Father in Heaven and God our Mother in Heaven
The story is rather simple, and we will tell it as such. However, heed the warning that a after the text was revealed, a hundred subsequent generations had time to spin many tales and embroider colorful tapestries about this section. Even today, modern writers continue to add intrigue, twist, and plot --- but the simple, humble, and compassionate answer is the right one.
**In short:**
Somewhere within the expanse of Domain of Spirit Energies (think of it a particular spectrum of energies), amidst many spirit heavens where many spirit-beings exist, one such a cluster is our spirit heaven and our spirit "tribe". The rulers of that Heaven are God our Father and God our Mother. Why do we say father and mother? Because the seed of spirit potential which we awaken and grow our spirit-self, comes from the energy essence of our parents --- they are our father and mother and we are their family. All beings of our spirit "species" are family --- millions of us.
**Here is the long story:**
Non-Wayists scholars don't have our background, which provides the keys to understand the story as a spiritual teaching. Most conflate it with tales from Domain of Soul Energy. We tell the story from the spiritual understanding.
The story starts long after theWAY (EnLil) was formed and the galaxies were created and populated. We guess the story happened about 10bilion years ago because human scientist tell us the exact birth date of our universe --- so give or take a few billion years between guessing-friends. When reading this, keep in mind scientists say that Earth was formed 5 billion years ago.
There once lived a soul-being somewhere in the Milky Way galaxy, who became a spirit, a god, and later also humankind's Father in Heaven when his heaven started a School of Divinity for Soul Beings on earth. This is the story of how that came about.
This soul entity lived many incarnations in different biological bodies. Over the ages He (we say He because later in the story it takes a yang-dominant role) advanced in compassion, more so than what was natural for soul-beings. He advanced in other skills as well, so much so that he could have become a soul deity in his tribe's soul heaven. But he declined. His compassionate calling was to be helpful to soul beings in incarnate states.
At one time, there was a metaphysical energy catastrophe on the planet where he was incarnated. Most beings were disembodied in the catastrophe and went back to their soul heavens, but he chose to remain to help those who struggled to find their way.
Spiritual deities from theWAY came down to that planet to repair the energy problem. Maybe there was an atomic meltdown caused by a reckless planetary core. Perhaps some volcano buddies played along, or a civilization with technology that went wrong (which happens all too frequently). We're just guessing to add intrigue (as do every generation of novelists, and eventually that changes the original story).
This highly advanced soul-being had developed the unique skill of attuning to spirit deities, making him invaluable to them, assisting them with his extensive understanding of the planet and the energy crisis affecting all the soul beings.
After coming back to their celestial abode, the deities informed their ruler about meeting a an advanced soul-being who "became like us" and, without its aid, saving the life forms on the planet would have been impossible.
The spiritual rulers in that celestial realm found it fascinating that a soul could evolve to possess such a remarkable level of compassion and lovingkindness, making it somewhat like a spiritual being in that respect. The gods conferred with gods of other spirit heavens. They made the decision to summon the soul and assess the situation.
Long story short, they helped the advanced soul to become an immortal like them, to be an advisor to the spirit deities, gods, who deal with similar matters on other planets.
The new spiritual being, driven by inordinate compassion, excelled again, way beyond expectation. The gods noted he excelled in gaining spiritual powers and abilities, even beyond what seemed advanced in their own heavens, and it happened because the new deity had more compassion, and was driven by exceptional passion to be helpful to soul-beings.
Spiritual beings are not normally passionate. Passions are marks of soul-beings. But this deity, had sanctified his passions and used that energy to drive his beneficence. That was the difference. This spiritual being had the passionate background and wisdom of the passions, because he used to be a soul entity. And, that made him a superior worker in helping soul beings.
Long story short, theWAY (probably a Council of Gods) appointed the deity as a God in charge of his own heaven to forward his cause. Gautama Buddha says our Heaven was created in the West. He should know because he lives there. We don't know whether this space is the West of the universe, or the West of our galaxy. We didn't even know there is an up and down or north and south in either.
Nevertheless, many ancient seers believed this new heaven is placed in the star system called Sirius, which is very close to our Sun. The name of the heaven was given as Pure Land of Bliss, which is Sukhavati in Sanskrit, and Uanna, the Light of the Heavens in Sumerian.
Eastern humans gave the God of Sukhvati a title, a Sanskrit title. He is known to us as Lord Illimitable Light. That title translates to Amita Abha in Sanskrit, or Amitabha to say it fluently. In the western world, the Sumerian name was Enki, which means Lord of Benevolence. A few hundred years later, in other cultures, Enki was said to be Lord of the Earth and heavenly Waters (energies). He was designated as Eternal Radiance, *immaru-aš*. The human-ascribed appellations for the God of our Heaven seem to revolve around 'radiant yang energy and benevolence'.
As agreed with the Council of Gods, Lord Amitabha (Enki) set his plan in motion to create a School of Divinity for Souls on a planet. They wanted more souls to evolve and become spirit-beings because those beings turned out to be the most beneficent and most skilful workers to provide services to troubled Soul Energy spaces.
In Sumer, the Lord was said to be God our Father of water (energy), wisdom, creation, and crafts on Earth. He created the neo-humans and taught them various skills and arts. He is also the keeper of the *Me*, the divine laws (Karma, Dharma, Maya, and other) that govern the system which we know as the School of Divinity for Souls.
Souls who were inclined to embrace humility, simplicity, and helpful loving-kindness (characteristics that are contrary to the nature of soul-beings) so they can evolve into immortal spiritual beings, were invited to join the School.
Lord Amitabha works in Yang-dominance as executive rulers must. God knew that his heaven needed a Yin touch because it is also a nursery for newcomer spirits, toddlers who would be reborn in Heaven. He appointed his beloved Pandaravasini to be God the Mother of Heaven, called Ninhursag in Sumerian. They are our spiritual parents, the regents of heaven.
Below is an ancient Sumerian engraving of the Queen of Heaven, God our Mother Ninhursag, with the symbol of Sirius, wearing a crown of the symbolic throne of the "cow-horn", the symbol of dual energies in governance.
Below is an ancient Sumerian engraving of God our Father in Heaven (Enki). There are almost no extant images of Lord Enki from the Sumerian era. For fifteen hundred years after the writings were first delivered, almost every neighboring country and newly conquered, adopted the ancient teaching, adding their own deities and changing the stories --- not realizing that the originals were in fact inviolable spiritual truths, not just myths to entertain the religious.
The following image is a contemporary, digital, meditative aid --- a graphic depiction of God the Father in Heaven with God the Mother in Heaven seated on a throne with what the Sumerians call the "divine cow horns".
God the Father, is often colored red (the color of passion) to symbolize His immense compassion for us. God the Mother, is typically colored as dark light, Yin-light.
Our heaven saw a steady increase in the number of spiritual beings who were like the gods, but with deep wisdom of life on planets, which they gained from compassion, humility, and simplicity --- distilled from lived experience as incarnate souls / spirits. They became the foremost helpers of soul-beings in metaphysical distress in the galaxy.
In School of Divinity for Souls, we build layers of wisdom by reflecting on human life experiences, introspection, and self-craft. The wisdom that evolves us into spiritual beings comes not downloaded to us, we discover it, we build it, layer upon layer. We earn every credit in the School by spiritual practice and devotion to the purpose of life. When we graduate, it is because of the effort we had put in, not who we know and praise in Heaven.
One should never neglect to honor and pay homage to our teachers and guides, the deities who so patiently watched over us all the time we walked, for lifetimes, leading us with inspiration and awakenings on the Path. These deities are called the Enkidu by the Sumerians (note how Enkidu is derived from Enki). In Sanskrit, they are our Taras. They work under the management of Lord Avalokiteshvara (a yang-dominant god), known as Ninurta in Sumerian. And his sister, Lord Prajnaparamita in Sanskrit (a yin-energy goddess), or Astarte / Ishtar in Sumer and Akkadian. According to ancient teaching, these two deities are considered to be the second-in-command in Heaven --- because they were the first offspring, twins, therefore the gods, our oldest brother and sister.
The end of the long version: of God our Mother and God our Father.

## Paradise: Temporary Heaven
The Sanskrit word  *purusthana* means 'temporary heavenly station.' In English language, we inherited the usage from the Greek, Latin, Arabic, and other languages to call it paradise (from the Garden of Eden); in Sumerian it is ki-zàþ.
Paradise is the temporary heaven or station where we stand over. It is the metaphysical place where we stand over between incarnations. No-one can come to, or leave from, a human incarnation unless they go via Paradise.
We who come and go through Paradise for our incarnations experience it as a place of rest and of judgement. The judgement is ours; we do the judging, and the Law of Karma is there to help us judge. Because we are unencumbered by the distractions and noise, and the cultural-thinking filters of body-mind, we have a clear view of our past incarnation. We can truly see the mistakes we made, we see deep into our own hearts, and feel the consequences thereof. It all helps to form more layers of wisdom so we can do better next time.
After we have done our own self-judging and have formed the final wisdom layers for the past human experience, it is time for the Law of Karma to evaluate what would be the most appropriate learning opportunity for us in the next incarnation. Karma will then put us in a family, gender, culture, time, and country to learn from those experiences --- all with the aim of helping us to graduate from Butterfly Path.
How we experience Paradise during our comings and goings, back and forth, depends a lot on our own soul/spirit maturity. Generally speaking, younger souls may find it more harrowing and senior souls find it blissfully ecstatic and wonderful.
In Paradise, we see deities, and interact with our spiritual guides, our Tara, more directly than what is possible when incarnated. We think we are in heaven and the bliss is often overwhelming. But, alas, it's only Paradise, and it is temporary.
In Paradise, we meet again with old acquaintances who are still awaiting their next incarnation. Some souls with deep compassion may linger in the the psychomesion which is the energy field which separates Paradise from Earth consciousness. Visualize it as somewhat of a rural scene with a straight path, almost like a tunnel that connects Earth with Paradise --- and at the end of the tunnel, the heavenly light.
But, if you decide to linger in the psycomesion, you are closer to incarnated souls, and if you're strong, you can be in touch with them. Some people linger there to finish up with affairs. Some linger because they are afraid of Paradise and the judgement they know to be coming --- which may involve being expelled from the School. Some linger because they don't want the trouble of another incarnation, childhood, and all that --- they want back into a body to continue the fun (as they define it) --- and those are the ones who try to move in and 'squat' in the bodies of like-minded individuals --- something that is called "demonic possession". Others may linger because they have a mission to protect someone special from serious soul-energy dangers (not from normal life, but serious dangers posed by bad souls) --- these are the cheeky ones. They put themselves at risk.
However, more than 95% of souls simply flow through the psychomesion on the path of light, straight into Paradise.
We are not yet prepared to experience Sukhavati Heaven. The intensity of energies in Sukhavati Heaven is dangerous for us. It may literally blow our minds, sort of like incinerate us, in other words. We need more spiritual skills and resilience, and the protection of our Tara and the helpers in Heaven to be reborn there.
Paradise is a time of reprieve for us. We can do some serious self-care. We receive counseling and guidance. And we rest and repair. When Karma decides, we are drawn into the reincarnation process and the deities who work in Paradise prepare us for the next womb, the next birth, the next family and the next human childhood.
Without passing through Paradise, no soul can attend Butterfly Path.
Newcomers to the Path are received in Paradise, and undergo the process of being modified to the likes of who we are: hybrid soul/spirit beings. The workers in Paradise (and one day we too may be working there) add to the soul an Anahata chakra, within which is placed the seed of spiritual potential. Any soul who does not pass through Paradise for this preparation, and incarnates into the human condition, does not have our hybrid nature. Such a soul cannot form a spirit.
And there are such souls on earth. Ancient literature refer to them as "lizards" because they don't have the warm hearts of souls with Anahata minds.
**To Recap**
Paradise is a temporary heaven where the new student's soul is modified to have an additional soul-mind, a dormant Anahata chakra mind. Anahata mind specializes in loving-kindness which transcends the loves of normal soul minds. The mind is dormant until the soul willfully goes there and develops by will the higher loves. In Anahata is placed the seed of spiritual potential. When Anahata develops, it "germinates" the seed of spiritual potential, and the three spiritual minds deploy over time. Anahata is the portal between lower-self and higher-self.
> *People who went to heaven and came back to talk about it, went to Paradise. If they say they saw God there, they did see a god or gods because the deities work from there and they interact with us. The human soul cannot go to Sukhavati Heaven, it is simply not possible for soul energies to enter the pure spiritual energy domains; not for any moral or esoteric reason, but for purely technical reasons.*\
> \
> *Most religions have visions of their Heaven and when you read how they experience it, your understand that heaven and its gods to be a soul heaven in the soul domain.*
The soul is mortal. It can live for a number of incarnations, depending on the species of soul. Typically, a soul has a lifespan of about 1,000 Earth years. However, if the human soul activates spiritual potential (in heart chakra) it gets energy sustenance through spiritual energies, called *amrit*, which flow freely for all who have tuned in to that connection. It will increase the lifespan of the soul. The soul that lacks loving-kindness and goodness typically has a short lifespan. The soul becomes immortal when it is metamorphosed into a spiritual entity, when *amrit* becomes its sustenance and only nutrition.
Example of the mortality of the soul: At one time Lord Iesous was distressed because he had to make some difficult strategic decisions how best to help save the soul-people in the long term. He went off into meditation to talk to Father in Heaven. He instructed the Wayist followers to watch over his body because his spirit would be leaving for a while. He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to the death of it. Stay here and watch." He left the soul of that body behind, else the body would die. The Lord said, he is so deeply sorrowful for having observed the destructive nature of humankind, he fears the soul in his body may perish. It is an interesting, and disconcerting thought that a soul can die of heartbreak.
The soul is fragile and has a set lifespan, but the spirit is immortal.

## The Adam and Eva Story
The importance of sensuousness in the School and the spiritual path is also the principle behind the story of Adam, Eva, and the Garden of Eden or Paradise. This story originally came from the Sumerian literature but is most known for several versions of it in the book of Genesis.
Sumerian culture valued the spiritual importance of sensuousness.
By way of example, look at some of their words.
-   The word for bliss is *sil:* It is made up of *si*,'to stand up like a horn', and *si*,'to fill', + *ul*, 'joy, pleasure'.
-   The word to undress is *zil:* made up from, to peel off; and *ul*, 'joy, pleasure'.
-   The word for to make beautiful or pleasing is *zíl*: made up of, to be loving, gentle, affectionate; to caress.
-   The word for temple prostitute is *nu-gig*: made up from 'not' + 'sick, or painful'. This was necessary for many ailments, for men and women. It was medically and spiritually necessary.
-   The word for a normal prostitute is *kar-kid*: made up of 'marketplace' + 'reed mat'.
The Hebrew term *eva* means "to live" or "to breathe", and the term *adam* means human, or the collective, humankind. For People of theWAY, eva is the soul which is the life force of the human. We see the foundations of these terms in a more ancient language and culture, in Sanskrit.
In Wayism, as will be shown below, we understand these two *eva* and *adam*, as metaphysical entities which together make us what we are, a living soul (that can give life to a material body) and a spiritual self.
The story of Adam and Eva is intrinsic to the story of the founding of Butterfly Path on Earth, our School of Divinity for Souls. When Heaven decided to move Butterfly Path to Earth, the gods decided that students should incarnate to the species homo sapiens sapiens. The sub-species was successful and dominated the other sub-species in the humanoid group. This is an euphemistic way of saying humans did then what they do now, they seek power and domination over others, destroy the culture of the other, insert theirs, and exploit the weak. That is simply how soul beings are, must be, and will be.
The School of Divinity for Souls relocated here just a short while ago, approximately 15,000 years back.
Our kind, the human soul who is a hybrid soul/spirit species, was first made in Paradise. That means, before a School is established, first the gods must establish a Paradise-type heaven.
The hybrid soul/spirit that would incarnate to live as neo-humans on earth, was then made in Paradise by the gods. They had to create a fledgling spirit, an Adam, and add to it a modified soul with an Anahata mind. Then, observe how the protype works and make adjustments until perfect. Then, they have the blueprints how to have those soul incarnate into human bodies. Simple spirit-science, it seems.
At the time, the Homo Sapiens Sapiens were the only humans. They were still pre-modern human, a hunter-gatherer group that appeared in many races and cultural variations. They had larger brains, smaller teeth, and lighter skeletons than their ancestors. They also developed language, culture, and complex tools. Homo sapiens sapiens had spread to other continents and encountered other humanoid species, with whom they interbred, and finally annihilated --- as humanoids do.
The gods changed something in the souls of students coming to Butterfly Path, to accept an additional soul-mind in which they would "plant the seed of spiritual potential".
Therefore, only about 15,000 years ago, we who are on Butterfly Path first came down from temporary heaven, Paradise, to have our first human incarnations. No one on Butterfly Path on earth, has been here for over 15,000 years.
In the story of Adam and Eve, we see the gods making first a yang-energy being called *adam*, 'in the image of the gods' --- they made a fledgling spirit because that is what will live in the human body. Spirit is predominantly yang-energy. In Sanskrit, *aham* (अहम्) means "I am" and *atman* means spirit. Aham is the spirit, a yang-energy entity.
The 2nd part made by the gods was a modified soul, the yin-energy being called *eva*. In Sanskrit, *jiva* जिव means "soul," or that which gives life to material being. It is a yin-energy being. Eva had the Anahata mind, so she had 4 soul-minds.
The text says, "male and female, they made them."
Working from Paradise, the gods made the human as a hybrid being. It has Soul (jiva, eva) with its usual three soul minds. The gods added the hybrid soul/spirit mind, Anahata (heart chakra). And they made a fledgling human Spirit (aham, atman, adam).
The Genesis story tells us that the gods, upon seeing the successful collaboration and communication between the two parts of the hybrid being, the lower-self and the higher-self, communicating through the kundalini "serpent", finally decided their prototype was good and ready to launch. They sent them out of Paradise to incarnate on Earth into homo sapiens sapiens. This was the start of the school we call Butterfly Path.
The first few generations of students on Butterfly Path lived under direct guidance of the deities who themselves had taken incarnate bodies. Under guidance of incarnated deities who watched over the new humans and transferred advanced life skills to them, the series of new neo-humans would help the homo sapien hunter gatherers to settle down with agriculture and animal husbandry.
At that time, deities walked the earth with the humans to keep an eye on how things are working out and whether modifications were needed to DNA or the metaphysical energy Laws. In the end, the Gods declared it all good, and let the system operate as planned.
Butterfly Path accepts souls that are well advanced. Advanced soul-beings have three minds: Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura which manage the brain-mind of the animal to which it incarnates.
Only in the human state is there a 4th soul-mind, the Anahata (the so-called heart chakra). Anahata is the bridge or portal between lower-self and higher-self.
Imbedded in Anahata is a seed of all spiritual potential. In Sanskrit we refer to it as Chintamani, the thought-jewel that grants its owner fulfillment of all desires. In fact, it is the seed of all spiritual potential. It is this spark of the purest spirit, which was donated to us by the most powerful spiritual being known to humankind, the one we worship as our Father in Heaven. The point of this paragraph is this: Anahata mind is about learning all different kinds of love. As soon as the soul learns of love that exceeds that which soul-beings normally have (all animals and most plants have souls and know affinity and love), it creates the warmth and moisture conditions for the seed of spiritual nature to deploy in us. This spiritual awakening, led by loving-kindness, introduces the spiritual minds --- our first spiritual awakening occurs.
Spirit has three minds. Those minds develop wisdom from reflecting on human experiences, and desiring to become more like the gods; we do self-craft, and we change for the better. The spiritual minds are Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara.
Therefore, our metaphysical body has seven minds: soul has 3, plus Anahata, and spirit has 3. Our essence, therefore, has seven minds, each is a specialist in a different aspect of being.
This is who we are. This is our essence. All our minds together generate an energy field(s) that radiates as a glow around us, like an aura. And that aura is the outer appearance of our energy body. That is us. We move from one incarnation to the next. We have lived in many different biological bodies. But we exist apart from them.
This is us, who will become perfected when the two (soul and spirit) become one. It is that future, perfected body of our ours, with seven sanctified minds, which will ascend to heaven to become an immortal self with a permanent identity.
Yet, we mustn't disregard the human bodies we frequently employ. We must acknowledge their minds and live our lives through them as well. But they are concerned about the material energy domain only, and they know only that reality.
We acknowledge that reality is not limited to the human body's perspective on life. Our reality is eternal and metaphysical, not temporary and burdened with survivalist animalistic matters.
The human body into which we incarnate has three minds (two of which are mind groups, because different organs and billions of microbial animals generate them).
The brain of the animal body generates an instinctive mind for survival, and the thinking mind we all know so well.
Then, we have the group-mind generated by the various organs (the omentum, heart, liver and others).
Then we have the group-mind generated by the entire microbiome of living beings existing in, and on, our body. Most sources agree that there are more than 10,000 microbial species that colonize the human body, and that they outnumber human cells 10 times. For every human cell, there are 10 microbiome entities. Their existence in and on the body makes the human body. Without them, the human animal body will not survive. We, the hybrid/soul being, are just going along for the ride and making some important decisions about the wholesomeness of that wonderful biological machine, the human host.
Some sources suggest that the human microbiome contains about 8 million unique protein-coding genes, which are 360 times more than the human genome. These genes contribute to various functions that are essential for human survival, such as digestion, immunity, metabolism, and protection against pathogens.
The human microbiome is not static, but dynamic and diverse. It can change over time and vary from person to person depending on factors such as age, diet, lifestyle, environment, genetics, and health status.
We play a crucial role in helping the body-mind to make the right decisions to keep the microbiome part of us wholesome and happy. Because when they are unhappy, our body-minds fall apart and we literally have body-mind ailments, our mental health deteriorates and along with it, and so too our quality of life.
Never be so audacious to say, you feel a bit under the weather, or you feel depressed. It is they who feel sick. Your awareness is simply of their suffering. You can leave the body and go to Paradise, but they will have to live and die in that body.
All three body-minds are necessary for normal human functioning. If any of the three body-minds feels ill, your western psychologist will notice abnormalities and your physician will prescribe something.
If the biome mind is ill, the observant psychologist will see symptoms like inability to connect spiritually, depression, anxiety, self-doubt, and general malaise of the mind. If the organ-minds become unwell, the psychologist will observe symptoms like "toxic" behavior, irritability, and insecurity. And your physician will prescribe something.
### In sum, we have 10 minds:
-   3 soul-minds made of energies from Domain of Soul Energy.
-   1 hybrid soul / spirit mind who traverse all three Domains.
-   3 spirit-minds made of energies from Domain of Spirit Energy.
-   3 body-minds which belong to Domain of Material Energy.
### To leave Paradise
In the Adam and Eva story, before the first group of souls could leave the protection of Paradise, they had to illustrate that they responded in accordance with their design. They placed the hybrid soul / sprit in two humanoids, one male, one female --- calling them Adam and Eva. They were designed to have a desire for wisdom, have inquisitiveness, and a desire for immortality, and for becoming divine beings. These are the qualities we must have to succeed in Butterfly Path.
In this story, the prototypes reacted as expected. Once they tasted, smelled, and delighted in the fruits of nature; suddenly, they discovered the erotic sense of touch, smell, taste and desire for one another, and they desired wisdom and immortality.
The Kundalini (symbolized by a snake) which links lower-self and higher-self, worked well. It expressed lower-self needs to higher-self, and viceversa. Eva tempted Adam, and Adam responded, and together they desired wisdom and immortality. Perfect!
They discovered their gender and sexual differences, experiencing intense pleasure when sensually interacting. One was Ki (Yin) dominant, the other Yang dominant, and together they made a formidable pair, the soul and spirit. They were ready to go out to join Butterfly Path, holding hands as they become more and more divine until they become as one --- spiritual beings.
Those two, Adam and Eve, became the first graduates of the new school that opened on planet Earth, the school we call Butterfly Path. Adam and Eva graduated, became immortals, and have been working from Heaven ever since.
In the following section, we learn how even gods must take sensuous souls to live amongst us in human form.

## Enki's Workers on Butterfly Path
Sumerian texts suggest that one group of divine observers and tutors on the launch of Butterfly Path were spiritual beings incarnated in bodies that lived under water. While on the surface, they avoided food and drink, resuming their underground or underwater routine in the evening until the following day.
This is interesting because these entities probably work on numerous planets where the living beings don't have a protective atmosphere and the exterior of the planet serves as a protective or defensive coating only, and all life forms live under the outer shell of the planet. The ancient teaching mentions this as if it is almost common sense.
Ancient writings give some information about the fact that some planets host advanced civilizations under the exterior planetary crust. Some of those planets have inhospitable exteriors, which probably serve as excellent protection against marauders from other planets. Some planets have gases and liquids which are dangerous and anti-life to Earth beings, but it may be their energy source and nutrition.
For example, Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. Titan has a thick atmosphere, and a surface covered with lakes and seas of liquid methane and ethane. It is also the only other place in the solar system where liquid water may exist, but below the surface. Titan is of interest to scientists because it may have conditions similar to those on early Earth.
Titan also has dangerous storms which produce methane rain, which can carve out river channels and fill up the lakes and seas. The storms are more frequent during summer season, which lasts for about seven Earth years. The storms can generate lightning and thunder (and the seas are methane!), as well as giant clouds that can cover an area larger than India.
The human tendency to prioritize their own perspective and importance in the universe makes it challenging for them to conceive of highly advanced civilizations that differ in appearance from fragile smooth-skinned bipeds with one head and two forward-looking eyes. In our search for other life forms, we spend billions of dollars looking for planets like Earth. But, the ancients said that other advanced beings exist, living in the oceans, below the oceans, and below the surface of other planets. We are the vulnerable ones, living on the exterior with constantly changing weather and terrible dangers like politicians and such.
We cannot know about these things, and probably should not care about the stories, except to remind ourselves to open our minds a bit. The following text and images are Sumerian, speaking to how spiritual beings came to sanctify the neo-human and teach them about creating civilization and settle down.
*"There made its appearance, from a part of the Erythraean Sea which bordered upon Babylonia, an animal endowed with reason, who was called Oannes. The whole body of the animal was like that of a fish; and had under a fish's head another head, and also feet below, similar to those of a man, subjoined to the fish's tail. His voice too, and language, was articulate and human; and they preserve even a representation of him to this day.*
*This being in the day-time used to converse with men; but took no food at that season; and he gave them an insight into letters and sciences, and every kind of art. He taught them to construct houses, to found temples, to compile laws, and explained to them the principles of geometrical knowledge. He made them distinguish the seeds of the earth, and shewed them how to collect fruits; in short, he instructed them in everything which could tend to soften manners and humanize mankind. From that time, so universal were his instructions, nothing material has been added by way of improvement. When the sun set, it was the custom of this being to plunge again into the sea, and abide all night in the deep; for he was amphibious. After this there appeared other animals like Oannes, of which Berossus promises to give an account when he comes to the history of the kings."*
The following are graphic representations, akin to photographs, of some of these ancient deities incarnated in forms other than typically human. Observe the prevalence of the tools in the tool bag, the wearable wrist device, the "medicine bucket," and an object said to resemble a "pine cone," prevalent in the ancient records of the People of theWAY.
This imagery is notably present in Mayan, Aztec, Sumerian, and later Babylonian records; it has also been adopted by the Roman Catholic Pope as a ceremonial display.
Other watcher and helper deities appeared as "angels" who would manifest and then disappear as if becoming unmanifest.
The first Annunaki to work on settling Butterfly Path were taller and physically more powerful than humans, like giants --- some would say. This may have been necessary because of the task they had, of taming the land and leading an uncivilized people. It is possible that the humans of the time were much smaller than today because of less protein in the diet and planetary conditions. But, none of this carries any importance. It is simply interesting to note what the elders of old passed on.

## Enkidu: Divine Helper Beings
### **The Enkidu (our Divine Taras)**
The Enkidu first came to Earth to oppose Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh was a supernatural humanoid who enslaved humans to mine gold for his extraterrestrial species.
The novel tale about Gilgamesh and an Enkidu has been a blockbuster bestseller for thousands of years, and the below depiction comes from ancient versions of the romanticized story. The actual spiritual story about the Enkidu is more fascinating, but only for senior students on the Path. That is what we will discuss below.
The oldest ancient text tells us about the Enkidu as a class of spiritual being, a deity, who specializes in working with souls on the Path. In Wayism, we refer to them as Taras, a Sanskrit term. The seniors among them are they who would set up a School of Divinity for Souls on a planet.
The Sumerian title Enkidu means, Lord of a Holy Place. The Sanskrit designation Tara means, they who ferry between two shores, or they who cross over, or they who ease the crossing to the other shore. They are deities who interact with humans to help them, guide them to the Light. They are whom Lord Jesus, more than 1,500 later, would call the *paraklētos*, the holy spirits who are our comforters and guides on the Path. But let's take the story from an early point in the Sumerian text and bring it up to relevance for us, today.
For a purely spiritual being (which is An (yang) dominant energy) to incarnate as a human, it must know and embrace sensuousness, which is Ki (yin) dominant energy.
For example, the ancient texts tell a story of an Enkidu who was sent by heaven to Earth to confront and stop Gilgamesh who was a cruel and oppressive ruler. \Note, Spiritual Heaven does not interfere directly\. They send a god to take human form, to teach the humans. Gilgamesh, however, was not a human. According to the ancient text, he was known as a Nephilim, a being from another planet.
People of theWAY understand that the Nephilim were a clan of cross-breed humanoids formed through interbreeding with extraterrestrial beings. During the time when Butterfly Path school was being established on Earth, the Nephilim had invaded the planet, primarily in central African and South American areas where precious metals were plentiful. Making use of human slaves, the Nephilim mined precious metals on earth and shipped it back to their planet. The deities of our Heaven had to stop the Nephilim to get rid of them and end their exploitation of the pre-modern humans. Not resorting to force or energy intervention by default, beings of our Heaven would first try to influence the oppressors to stop being cruel. The mission was successful and Gilgamesh remained on Earth without harming the people. They lived out their lives on earth, as gentler overlords, but could never enter Butterfly Path school.
However, before the Enkidu which the deities sent to Earth could act in the material domain, he had to be "civilized," as the text says. Which means he had to learn the human way and attach to himself a soul in order to incarnate and walk among us. For that, he had to encounter sensuousness, because the yin-dominant soul is sensuous and the human body is ultra-sensuous. Every planet, every animal body, is different. He had to encounter nature on Earth, which is what he did, and he fell in love with the trees and animals.
The height of sensuousness is sex because it encompasses most human senses and connects to our spiritual self (when done right) to heaven through Anahata-mind. For this purpose, other Enkidu on the team (who were not incarnated) arranged a sacred sex worker from a temple of Ishtar to teach our incarnating Enkidu about this aspect of sensuality.
In this, he received a thrust of Ki energy which made for him an advanced soul. That union led to his material appearance, acquisition of a body and soul, and engagement in human form.
About 2,500 years after this text, early Christian theologians spent an inordinate amount of energy and time to decide whether Lord Iesous (Lord Jesus in Latin) was fully a god, or fully human and a god. Or was he a god who only appeared human? Many scholars lost their livelihoods in the academic struggle because they did not always agree with the popular narrative.
Wayists followers of Lord Iesous, of course knew he was a deity, a god, who temporarily took a soul to incarnate and teach among us as a human being. He was both fully divine and fully human, for as long as he needed that human body and soul. We were aware of its truth, as he himself proclaimed it, and these age-old doctrines have consistently affirmed it even two millennia prior to the divine manifestation in the form of the human man named Iesous.
According to legend, the mother of Iesous had a transcendental experience (like many mystics have claimed over the years) in which a spiritual being (angel / tara) engaged with her in a sensual manner, leading to her subsequent pregnancy. This too is what they say about the conception of the person who incarnated as Gautama Buddha, and of several other avatars who came to Earth. This is not to say that the mother did not become pregnant because of human intercourse --- it means the formation of the soul in the human foetus was formed by divine intervention, so a divine spirit could attach to it for the purpose of incarnation.
The birth of the divine incarnation was not only the result of ordinary human conception, but rather divine intervention in the formation of the soul within the blessed mother's womb. Spiritual beings, in their infinite wisdom and compassion, formed the pure soul without karma (without sin, the theologians would say) that would inhabit the physical body, allowing a divine spirit of the highest order to attach to it, to incarnate in human form.
This sacred act was not a negation of the natural process of pregnancy, but a divine blessing upon it, imbuing the developing fetus with a soul of divine origin and purpose. Through this miraculous intervention, the way was prepared for the incarnation of a being whose spirit was one with the Divine, destined to guide humanity towards spiritual awakening and unity with the Supreme.
Ki, is the basis of all sensuous energy and soul, with all its complicated emotions, needs, miraculous powers, good, and bad potential, and limitations. Why the gods can incarnate into a human soul is because of its unique Anahata Mind, the heart chakra. It is here that our spiritual potential lies dormant. The incarnating god, or avatar, will immediately activate it to be fully spirit and fully human. It will immediately sanctify the soul minds --- which is what we are doing on Butterfly Path.
The principle behind an avatar of the gods is that it is a material representative of their spiritual manifestation. To truly manifest, it is necessary to engage in a harmonious, sensuous relationship with yin energies, allowing them to stabilize atoms, maintain organ function, and circulate vital breath. Their body must eat, sleep, do ablutions, and is subject to mortality just as are ours.
The Enkidu are highly skilled experts. Unlike other spiritual entities, their special gift lies in their ability to engage with us on the most elemental planes of spiritual consciousness. There is no need for advanced spiritual progress to meet with a divine Tara or Enkidu. They have the capacity to understand and connect with us at the lowest levels of spiritual vibrations. As long as we embrace love, honor, and respect the significance of the connection, they serve as our spiritual instructors, imparting valuable knowledge and understanding. They acknowledge the significance of sensuous experiences, prompting us to employ them for enriching our spiritual connections and awareness.
They are our faithful Divine Taras, powerful, divine, beneficent, and true. To help our brain-minds to establish a connection, we need to visualize the Tara's energy body as warm and enveloping, like a gentle embrace. They present themselves in a relatable way, allowing us to connect with them in a devout relationship.
In Wayist tradition there are several books of poems and guidance in various languages, carrying teachings from Taras, or Enkidu as they were known in the original Sumerian teachings.
The following are five modernized, digitized graphic depictions of Divine Taras that have been with devotees for a long time. Typically, they are depicted in various skin colors to signify the mind-energy they produce at the time --- to indicate where they resonate with you. It\'s not important, but noteworthy. There are at least fifty diverse meditation images of Taras from all cultures which have become popular among devotees --- but you can use your own imagination to connect with your Divine Tara.
The meditative images of Divine Tara which we create in our brain-minds include subtle details that prompt us to remember their role as divine aids for connection, rather than representations of true reality (which is pure spiritual energy).
Throughout history, worshippers have intentionally added visible imperfections to the images, as a way to pay tribute to the principle that we *know* it is an imperfect image.
Our reverence for the graven image stems not from worship, but from its ability to facilitate meditation and contemplation. We worship the spiritual entity with whom we connect in our heart and higher-self minds.

## Anunnaki: Our Potential
All the deities in the heavenly Land of Pure Bliss were born from a divine spark, or seed, originating from the spiritual essence of our Heavenly Father. That divine spark in our Anahata germinates to grow a full-fledged spirit. We are children of the king and queen of Heaven. The Gods of our Heaven are our father and mother in Heaven, and all our siblings therefore are princess and princesses. To that effect, as children of the King and Queen rulers of Heaven, we too are on the path to becoming, by definition, princes or princesses of Heaven. This brings us to the object of the paragraph: *we were created by "princely seed,"* which is the meaning of the Sumerian term *anunnaki*. Therefore, according to our teaching, we are all on the Path with the potential to become *anunnaki*.
Our School was established by senior anunnaki. The reason we belabor this point is to help the Wayist navigate the myriad myths and stories for soul entertainment about the Anunnaki that prevails out there. You need skill to keep your brain-mind straight about this because soul-people love this genre and perpetually add their own take on ancient teachings, but they lack the spiritual insight and training to get it right. And, as life goes, soul-people find true spiritual teaching boring and insufficient. So they embroider their own religions on our foundations.
The first modified souls to incarnate to humans obviously came via Paradise. The modification process attached the souls of all beings to an Anahata chakra, embedding the seed of spiritual potential within them. They were different from other humanoids of the time. In fact, they were seen as an advanced alien species, which of course they were, because they came from all over our galaxy to attend School here --- they were not from Earth.
Because of their Anahata mind, the neo-humans understood animals and plants better. Almost immediately, they settled communities and invented animal husbandry and improved agriculture. They made food forests and used work animals with whom they lived as equals.
The humanoid soul religions of the time told stories about alien gods from Paradise who came down to live on Earth. These people were nothing more than advanced students on the Path. In that time, people like us, were looked upon as semi-deities because of the comparison with the humanoids who were the original inhabitants. Junior students recorded stories of how these gods mated with humanoids and ruled over nature (through farming and domesticating animals).
Among these neo-humans, Melchizedek emerged as a prominent spiritual leader, often referred to as an anunnaki. He was not an annunaki at the time, but an advanced student on the Path to become an annunaki, an immortal.
He embarked on a journey to teach the spirituality of theWAY, guiding souls along the transformative Butterfly Path. The soul religions of that time considered the new spiritual teaching to be a deviation from the norm. Melchizedek became the leader of a community of advanced students; they called their country, Salem, meaning peace. The ancient soul-religion scriptures refer to Melchizedek as the King of Salem.
With the increasing population of hybrid soul/spirit humans, a growing number of followers from soul religions converted and the souls of their offspring were all new students who came via Paradise, who also had hybrid Anahata-minds with the seed of spirit potential.
The People of theWAY were exceedingly successful on earth because of their knowledge of plants and animals, codes of conduct and understanding of soul nature. They were very attractive breeding stock and therefore formed large clans in group marriages.
For thousands of years, the teachers of theWAY were known and respected as "priests in the order of Melchizedek." In certain soul-religion writings, the term was a cautionary message, to stay away from the people of theWAY. But, eventually, because of the success of the people, it became very attractive.
According to Psalm 110 in the Hebrew Scriptures, King David casts himself as a "priest in the order of Melchizedek". The scripture says he will be sustained by "drinking from the fount of theWAY." It is said he will Lord over the Hebrews and give them victory of their lower-self, where the enemy is within. That sounds very Wayist. However, the Wayist rhetoric gives way to another ethic, which is contrary to Wayism. The psalm says their god will help the Jews to kill most of the people in the world, so they can rule the world. That is common talk for the Bible and the Quran, to have the God visualize how non-believers will be annihilated in wars to establish their tribe as rulers over the world.
That is what we mean when we say soul-people build their religions on the foundations of pure spirituality. Those within their ranks who develop higher-self awareness stop believing the scriptures and dogma as they discover the mysticism that is the true Path. It is from those mystics, embedded in monasteries and enclaves, that the Rumi's, Kabir's, Janabai's and John of the Cross' of the world send forth their rebelliously beautiful and very helpful works to their ilk.
Elsewhere in the Jewish scriptures, it is told how Abraham, the father of Judaism and of Islam, was saved from destruction by a king of Salem, a priest king in the order of Melchizedek. This priest administered to Abraham the Wayist spiritual ritual of partaking in bread with water and wine, with the reminder, "this is my body (the bread), this is my soul (water) and this is my spirit (the wine added to the water)". Another version was to use the symbols of bread, salt (soul), and wine --- these were common everyday meals. This is what "breaking bread with loved ones" means. Wayists do this "remembrance" with every meal, and we may also do it as a rite in devotional moments. We do this to attune us to the energy ecology of all soul-beings in nature and in our midst, we do it as a reminder of the nature of our complex self. The use of adding alcohol or drinking beers or boiled teas was the standard for millennia, because it was the safer form of water to drink --- a skill we learned from the first annunakis. The story ends with Abraham donating a tenth of his belongings to the king who saved him from destruction in a war.
Wayist, Christian, and other traditions mention in their writings that Lord Jesus was a priest in the order of Melchizedek.
It's not surprising that later generations of soul-religion people embellished upon these stories and wrote many volumes about the Anunnaki, creating elaborate myths that catered to those who sought entertainment. There used to be a book in the Hebrew scriptures and the original Christian Bible, still included in the Ethiopian Church, called the Book of Enoch. Enoch is one of the earliest graduates from Butterfly Path (before the first writing survived) and the book attributed to him belongs to an early religion.
Many stories originated from cults that worshipped annunnaki. Teaching of theWAY was not sufficiently complicated for people. They wanted more spice and intrigue. To embrace the simple teaching that we are evolving into what the ancient Sumerians called the Anunnaki is not enough material for a religion, so they create more of what soul-people need, more intrigue, stories that look like scripts for a TV series, and that is how it will be.
Our intention with this is to shine a light on the Anunnaki and Melchizedek, allowing newcomers to the Butterfly Path to sidestep the hazardous byways of fascinating novel stories about them.

## Sirius: The Spiritual Heaven
The concept of heaven in Sumerian religion was closely associated with divinity, brightness of energy, and radiating wholesome energy. The eight-pointed star was a symbol of Heaven.
Ancient civilizations, starting at least with the inhabitants of the Wayist people of Göbekli Tepe about 9,000 years ago, revered Sirius as a source of spiritual energy and divine guidance --- possible because it is the brightest star in our sky. In Wayism, it is believed to in fact be plausible that Sirius may be the location of Sukhavati, our Heaven. It does not matter though, whether that plausibility turns out right or wrong. It's just a mental idea we can hold in mind, if it helps one in their meditations and devotional practice.
Hence, purely for mental entertainment, let's explore others who also held, whether justified or not, this very notion.
Throughout history, various cultures and religions have utilized the 8-pointed star as a symbol. Let me share with you a few popular interpretations of the 8-pointed star.
The ancient Egyptians associated the 8-pointed star with the goddess Isis, who symbolized life, death, and rebirth. The star also marked the annual flooding of the Nile, which brought renewed life, growth, fertility, and prosperity to the land. Very much in line with the Wayist teaching of reincarnation, growth, and rebirth as a spiritual being. Here's an intriguing fact: when Jesus' parents were taken to Egypt by their benefactors, the "wise men from the East", they found refuge on an island in the Nile River, where they were cared for by the Sisters of Isis. From there, the young Lord Jesus attended the university in Alexandria and when he was about 14, his parents took him to Galilee, whence they came. His journey from Galilee to the East was made possible by the support and protection of his benefactors, enabling him to embark on an iconic road trip along the Silk Route. This is how the teaching of theWAY was spread worldwide during that period.
In ancient Mesopotamia, the 8-pointed star was associated with the goddess Inanna, who was the patron of love and fertility. One of the oldest poems, The Descent of Inanna, dates to c. 1900-1600 BCE, in which the Queen of Heaven journeys to the underworld to save the spirit-people (people who had awakened spiritually but were captured in the underworld).
In ancient Greece, the 8-pointed star was called *Seirios*, meaning "scorching" or "glowing". It was identified with courage to be real, authenticity, honor, sanctified passions, and creativity. Very much higher-self Wayist teachings.
Below, there is an ancient Sumerian graphic depicting Enki, our heavenly father, alongside other celestial beings who are also described as workers in heaven. It's important to note that four of the aspects of the eight-pointed star in the graphic were converted into flowing energy. The workers are bringing down the skill of manipulating energies to Earth, where advanced spiritual practitioners will harness their mastery to promote positive change.
The graphic depicts an event in which heavenly workers must, again, re-establish the ancient teaching and awareness of theWAY because it had become obscured and past writings, teachings, and Waysit culture was, yet again, destroyed. This event occurs towards the end of each School cycle, serving as a bittersweet reminder that the juniors are on their way, ready to dismantle and destroy the seniors' hard work.
With determination in their hearts, the new group of juniors will dismantle what the elders held sacred and set out on a journey to discover the ultimate truths of reality, the purpose, the meaning, and the truth. And some time in the future, millennia later, they will "stumble upon it", they will "discover it" because heavenly workers brought it to their attention. Because they "discovered it", they own it and they cling to it. It is theirs and they value it. And that is theWAY, it cannot be any different.
You will not be surprised to hear we are now, again, in that part of the cycle in which awareness of theWAY is so obscured, it was so deeply dismantled; it is again being reinstated. For older souls among you, your soul will jump and awaken in recognition of things you have known for ages. For some people, it will become immediately apparent that this is the absolute best option, surpassing anything they have ever encountered. This is because they have reached a moment in their lives where they are now ready to delve into the profound depths of the spiritual Path. And, as Teacher LaoTzi said, they who are not ready for it will scoff at it. As Lord Jesus reminded, "...pearls before swine, they will trample it, and turn around and rend you." Interesting how life works along theWAY.
How will you know when teaching of theWAY is in danger again? When it becomes a popular movement --- the writing is on the wall to watch closely how it crumbles. When the house crumbles and the earth shakes, what do you do? Grab your kids, animals, spouse, and books, and retreat to where the space is still wholesome.
When you witness the dismantling of the Good in progress, the urgency becomes palpable. In the new cycle, they will devote centuries to unraveling the same ancient truth that has endured throughout time.
There is safety in this. Junior souls in the School, if given access to spiritual powers, would not utilize it for good. And this is the reason teachers and People of theWAY say, if you are in fact ready to receive the higher Path, do it as a matter of absolute priority because soon the cycle turns, and you may have to continue with samsara for millennia for the new wave of students to rise through the grades until the next mass graduation. Or, you will live in the new era, a very dystopian new era, and have a harder time following your spirituality and getting the right experiences to advance. This book, our teachers, the internet as you know it, won't be available in time to come. That is just how it is.
An anonymous writer from Samarkand, writing in a western dialect, probably dating to the 2nd century, wrote the following: "It is thought that Sukhavati heaven located at Sirius is the ultimate destination for those who have reached enlightenment and are on the path towards becoming Spiritual Immortals of our type."
According to Wayist teachings, Sirius is ruled by the Father and Mother of Heaven, the divine beings who created Butterfly Path as a School of Divinity for Soul Beings on Earth. They are the ultimate source of wisdom and love, guiding those on their spiritual journey towards enlightenment.
For Wayists, whether Sukhavati is actually in the Sirius star system or not, does not matter at all. It\'s irrelevant. Sirius is just a symbol for our brain-mind to attach to. Sirius, therefore, is not just a physical star system visible in the night sky, but a symbol of the spiritual realm that exists beyond our physical reality. It is the spiritual home of the People of theWAY, our family whom the elders in the East called the Holy Lotus Family.
The concept or symbol of Sirius as a spiritual heaven aligns with the core beliefs of Wayism --- living a life of mutual benefit service, *chrestotes* or helpful loving-kindness, and simplicity, with love for the Divine and other beings. It embodies our quest for authenticity, courage to live right and own our own mind, walk with honor and never stop being creative with self-craft. This devotion to Heaven, the energy that connects us to grace and goodness, is what leads People of theWAY towards their final destination.
But even for those who may not have reached enlightenment or spiritual awakening in this lifetime, Sirius still holds a special significance as a source of spiritual inspiration and guidance. We believe the energy emanating from heaven guides and protects those on the Path towards enlightenment, guiding them through life's challenges and helping them stay connected to the Path. Every soul on Butterfly Path has a Divine Tara to protect, comfort, and guide them.
In Wayism, Sirius is not just a distant star, but the concept of a spiritual heaven, which serves as a reminder of our true purpose and the ultimate destination for our soul evolving into spirit. It is a place of love, wisdom, and eternal peace, where all beings are united in the ever-expanding energy of theWAY. So let us continue on our journey towards spiritual awakenings, guided by the loving wisdom of our heavenly family.
#### In Sum
In the span of just five lines, the ancient Sumerians encapsulated a spiritual teaching of astounding depth and clarity. From the primeval sea of Nammu to the sacred union of Enki and Ki, they traced the unfolding of reality and revealed our place within it.
As Children of Enki, we are the inheritors of this profound wisdom. The esoteric secrets encoded in the Sumerian texts are not relics of a bygone age, but living truths that guide us still upon theWAY. By studying and absorbing their messages, we connect ourselves back to the very source of spiritual insight.
Yet this is not the end, but a beginning. The Sumerian cosmology is the seed, but it falls to each of us to cultivate it, to allow its wisdom to flower within our own souls. As we walk the Butterfly Path, let us hold these ancient truths in our hearts, letting them illuminate our way.
In a world of transient distractions and ephemeral concerns, the ancient teaching of theWAY is a beacon of permanence, a reminder of what is Real and what truly matters. May it continue to inspire and guide seekers of wisdom for ages to come, as it has for 5,000 years already. This is the legacy of the stylus masters of Sumer, the birthright of every Child of Enki. May we prove worthy inheritors of this sacred gift.

## Closing
As we conclude our journey through the ancient wisdom of the Sumerians and its relevance to Wayism, it\'s crucial to remember that the historical and cosmological details explored in this book, while fascinating, are not essential for walking the spiritual path.
The true essence of Wayism lies not in intellectual knowledge of ancient texts, but in the lived experience of compassion, simplicity, and spiritual growth.
This book serves primarily as a resource for teachers of Wayism and those deeply interested in its historical roots. For the majority of seekers on the Butterfly Path, the core teachings of love, authenticity, and self-transformation are all that\'s needed to progress spiritually.
Remember, the purpose of human life --- to evolve our souls into immortal spiritual beings --- remains constant regardless of our understanding of ancient cosmologies.
Focus on cultivating loving-kindness, embracing simplicity, and nurturing your spiritual awareness in daily life. These practices, rather than historical knowledge, are what truly matter on the journey to spiritual awakening.
May you walk the Path with joy, compassion, and an open heart, ever mindful of the divine spark within you and all beings.

## About the Editor
The enigmatic pen name "Salvar Dàosenglu" represents a consortium of Wayist monks hailing from diverse corners of the globe, united in their fervent mission to revive and disseminate the essential teachings of theWAY.
These erudite scholars, with roots spanning India, China, Western Europe, Canada, and the United States, bring to bear a wealth of expertise accumulated over multiple lifetimes of immersive study in the realms of Wayism, Buddhism, Yogi Philosophy, Christian theology, and the esoteric wisdom of the world's great spiritual traditions.
The very name "Salvar Dàosenglu" encapsulates the essence of their sacred charge: an ascetic wayfarer upon the Path, tirelessly proofing and refining the Teaching to ensure its pristine integrity. Yet, in a poignant illustration of the ephemeral nature of language and the ease with which meaning can be obscured by the passage of time, the name itself --- an amalgam of Latin and Chinese, each word gravid with layered significance --- risks being lost in translation. A whimsical soul, afflicted with a penchant for the absurd, might render it as something akin to "Road Worker's Ointment" --- a charming phrase, to be sure, but one far removed from the profound \'Wayist Healer\' which Salvar prefers.
Herein lies the crux of Salvar Dàosenglu's mission: to cut through the accretions of centuries and the vagaries of language, to restore the Teaching to its original clarity and potency. It is a task that demands the utmost rigor, discernment, and devotion --- qualities that the monks behind the pen name embody in abundance.
Through their meticulous editorial oversight and exegetical prowess, they ensure that the works bearing the imprimatur of Salvar Dàosenglu are infused with the undiluted essence of the Way.
To encounter Salvar Dàosenglu is to embark upon a journey of spiritual illumination, guided by a voice at once timeless and urgently relevant. Whether through the pages of their books or in the vibrant digital haven of the Wayist.Life community, seekers will find in Salvar Dàosenglu an invaluable companion and catalyst on the path to awakening.
