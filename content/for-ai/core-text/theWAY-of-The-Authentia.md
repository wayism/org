## Introduction
For millennia, The Authentia has been a guiding light for seekers of truth, a sacred tome cherished in the hallowed halls of Wayist training centers. Its pages contain the very essence of our philosophy, the foundational principles for teaching theWAY and understanding the nature of being itself.
In 2023, a momentous decision was made. The Board of Elders of theWAY, in their infinite wisdom, chose to share this treasure with the world. No longer would The Authentia\'s profound insights be confined to cloistered sanctuaries, privy only to a select few who could listen to its deeper meanings revealed by teachers wise and dedicated. It was time for the veil to be lifted, for the light of its teachings to illuminate the path for all of humanity at large.
Though concise in form, The Authentia contains endless depths of meaning to explore. Its enigmatic verses have the power to captivate teachers and inspire weeks of profound discourse. Yet even a brief encounter with its wisdom can spark transformation, offering the modern Wayist scholar invaluable understandings.
In ages past, access to such esoteric knowledge was limited by necessity. But times have changed. Today, the quest for truth burns brightly in the hearts of many. Literacy and critical thinking abilities have flourished. Technology has made it possible for theWAY to reach students across the globe, to share the most profound spiritual concepts more widely than ever before. The old limitations of ashrams, monasteries and temples need constrain us no more.
At the core of The Authentia is a comprehensive ontology, a complete understanding of the fundamental questions that define the human experience: Why are we here? What is our purpose? Where do we come from and where are we headed? The text illuminates the nature of the mind, the origins of the soul, the myriad forms of spiritual beings, and so much more. It lays out the architecture of reality itself - the physical, the metaphysical, and the interplay between them that shapes our existence.
Seekers of every background will find in these pages a feast for the spirit. The Authentia speaks to the universal human experience, to the spark of divinity that resides within us all. It calls us to look beyond the illusions of the material world, to discover our true nature and embrace our sacred purpose.
In this volume, you will encounter The Authentia in its purest form, unencumbered by commentary. For those fluent in the language of spirit, this is the ideal way to imbibe its wisdom. Yet assistance is readily available. Online courses, media and a vibrant community of practitioners await at Wayist.Life, ready to guide you to ever deeper levels of understanding.
One need not be a scholar to grasp the essence of this teaching. The path it reveals is open to all - a path of love, unity and transcendence. By walking this path, by applying the principles of The Authentia in our daily lives, each of us can awaken to our divine potential. We can rise above the suffering and limitations of the material plane and discover what it means to be truly free.
The Authentia is more than a book. It is an invitation, a doorway, a bridge between worlds. And now, at long last, it is available to all who sincerely seek. May it be a lantern for your journey, illuminating the way to your highest truth. May it rekindle the flame of spirit within you and guide you home to the divine source from which we all emerge.

## The Premise of the Story
### In an age long past, a seeker sits in silent contemplation, his heart yearning to comprehend the very nature of the divine
In an age long past, a seeker sits in silent contemplation, their heart yearning to comprehend the very nature of the Divine. In this sacred space between breaths, between thoughts, an unexpected presence emerges. A celestial being, an Immortal Guide, reaches across the veil to initiate an intimate dialogue. Thus begins a tale as old as time itself, a story of revelation and transformation that echoes through the centuries.
The Authentia, our sacred text, is born from this mystical encounter. The Immortal Guide, a luminous embodiment of theWAY itself, imparts secret teachings intended for those pure of heart, those ready to receive the unfiltered essence of truth. This is no ordinary wisdom, but a transmission from the very heart of the Divine, a gift to be cherished and protected.
In the grand tradition of the mystery schools of Egypt, Rome, and Western Asia, The Authentia weaves a tapestry of profound insights and esoteric knowledge. The Immortal Guide, though formless and vast, speaks with the intimacy of a beloved friend, inviting the seeker to explore the deepest questions of existence.
As the story unfolds, the seeker is granted visions of breathtaking clarity, each one a window into the nature of reality itself. The Immortal Guide deftly navigates the realms of form and formlessness, revealing the intricate dance of creation and the role of the Divine within it all.
Yet this is not merely a passive revelation. The seeker is called to engage, to ask the burning questions that stir within their soul. And in the asking, the answers begin to take shape, not as mere intellectual concepts, but as living, breathing experiences of truth.
When the seeker\'s inquiries turn to matters of self and purpose, the Immortal Guide knows it is time for a journey beyond the veil. In an instant, the seeker is transported to the spiritual realm, where a benevolent deity awaits, ready to illuminate the path ahead.
This is the essence of The Authentia - a sacred dialogue, a journey of the soul, a map to the very heart of existence. It is a story that transcends time and culture, for it speaks to the universal human quest for meaning, for connection, for ultimate truth.
To engage with The Authentia is to embark on a journey of transformation. Like the seeker in the story, we are invited to ask the deep questions, to open ourselves to the wisdom that emerges in the stillness. And as we do, we begin to awaken to our own divine nature, to the vast potential that lies within.
This is a path that requires courage, for it asks us to release our attachment to the known and venture into the uncharted territories of the soul and spirit. Yet we do not walk alone. Our Immortal Guide, our individual Tara, is our constant companion, illuminating the way with its timeless wisdom.
As you immerse yourself in the story of The Authentia, allow yourself to be transformed by its power. Let it ignite the spark of divine remembrance within you, and guide you to the truth of who you really are. For in the end, this is the ultimate promise of The Authentia - not merely information, but liberation, a return to the source from which we all emerge.
The story awaits. The journey begins anew with each turning of the page. May the ancient message of The Authentia be a sacred companion on your path, now and always.
## The Authentia
### Unembellished by teaching notes to elucidate the esoteric
Verses 1 and 2 Once on a time, my mind was meditating, on the things that are.
By chance, my thought was raised to a great height! The senses of my body, being held back---just as people who are weighed down with sleep after a fill of food, or from fatigue of body.
Methought, a Being more than vast, in size beyond all bounds, called out my name inside me and saith\...
What wouldst thou hear and see, and what hast thou in mind to learn and know?
And I do say: Who art thou?
He saith: I am The Authentia. The Wisdom of The Way; I know what thou desire and I'm with thee everywhere.
3\.
I replied, Sire, I long to learn the things that are, and comprehend their nature, and know God. This is, I said, is what I desire to hear.
He answered back to me: Hold in thy mind all thou wouldst know, and I will teach thee.
The Supreme Absolute, no mortal soul, no immortal, no creature can know; but I will show you in a Vision, in your Awareness.
Even with these words His aspect changed, and straightway, in the twinkling of an eye, all things were opened to me, and I Aware of a Vision limitless, all things turned into Light, sweet, joyous Light, and Dark Light, sweet, poignant Dark Light. And I became transported as I observed.
4\.
But in a little while Darkness came settling down on part of it. Formidable and ominous, coiling in sinuous folds, so that methought it like unto a whirlpool, of darkness ink\...
And then the Darkness changed into some sort of a Moist Nature, tossed about beyond all power of words, belching out smoke as from a fire, and groaning forth a wailing sound of matter forged, that defies all description.
Thereon, out of the Divine Light, an Energy like a Divine Word, descended on that Moist Nature. And they commingled as if in loving passion, as if the universe in two energies, Dark and Bright, flowed the one into the other and rhythmic eruptions came forth. Upwards to the height from the Moist Nature leaped forth pure Fire; Light was it, swift and active too.
5\.
Thereon, out of the never-ceasing Divine Play of Divine Lovers, male and female He made them, came forth an Energy likened unto a Divine Word, the Divine Sound, with its own Beautiful Rhythm and all possible tones of Vibrations; and the Word said, I Am the Way, the Reason, the Light, and the Laws.
6\.
Then saith to me the Authentia: Did\'st understand this Vision what it means?
Nay, Sire, that I desire to know, I said.
That Beautiful Light is the creative Idea from Divine Mind which makes the Source of all, and within rests Divine Darkness and Divine Light. That Beautiful Light, He said, is the Idea of the Supreme Absolute to have Source, from where all Creative Potential flows.
In Source were the Two: manifesting as the Daughter of The Source, Moist and Dark Nature who appeared from the Light of Darkness; and the Son of The Source, Aethereal and Light Nature, who appeared from the Light of Brightness.
The Two flow from the Source. All that exist, exist in the Space which The Source creates with Divine Play of Creation. All Space fills with Aethereal Soup of all Potential, and the Two make their Word and in it, The Way.
7\.
What then? --- begged I of the Lord, as my mind could not contain all of that.
Know that whichever exist in Creation, exists only because of Divine Source; from the Mind of the Supreme Absolute. Not separate are they, the Divine Source, and the Divine Mind of the Supreme Absolute, the one from other; and because of their common origin all is alive with Their Presence.
Know that whichever has soul, and whichever wisdom thou may have, and which thou seest and hears is the Supreme Daughter, from the Divine Source. Not separate are they, the Divine Daughter and the Source, the one from other; and because of their loving union all is alive with Their Presence. They are present in all Life.
Know that whichever have spirit, and whichever thou sense and think, is the Divine Son, from the Divine Mind of the Source. Not separate are they, the Son and Source, the one from the other; and because of their loving union all is endowed with Their Presence.
Know that whatever exists have the Daughter and the Son in essence; forever in Divine Play, and by that Play, all Energy Exist.
Know that which lifetimes thou had, which incarnations, which lives lived and all thou minds, and all thy kind, and all species, exist in The Way; manifested from the loving and passionate play of the Divine Son and the Divine Daughter. Not separate are they, The Way and the Son, and the Daughter and the Divine Source, the one from the other; and because of their loving union all are endowed with Their Presence.
Thanks be to Thee, I said.
8\.
So, understand the Bright Light and the Dark Light, and make friends with It, saith the Authentia to me.
I asked, Lord, through making friends with the Light, Lord, mayest I know the Supreme Absolute, the Creator God?
Thou mayest, but thou canst. No creature can know the Supreme Absolute, or the Source of all creative energies. Even if the pot may have affinity for the Potter, it canst know Him. What human language and the minds of immortals mayest say The Supreme Absolute or the Source from Divine Mind is, all is false, all lies. Hush! therefore, lest they blaspheme and lie about The Supreme Absolute.
9\.
You and I, all who exist manifest and exist unmanifest, observe The Source in all; the substance of all is Divine Energy, all that exist are species of energy of kinds; All from the Source that originate from Divine Mind.
Impossible it is to not think, desire, drink, smell, touch, see, experience, be aware, and observe the Energy of The Source, because it is within and without, it is in thee and I, it is the sand, the blood, the air, the plant, the insect, the animal, and fish on thy platter!
And I say: Lord, I am perplexed, what sayest Thee; the Divine Source be the fish and the plant?
When you have in mind the idea of a stool, the thought is not you; the stool is not you, the idea and work to create come from you, but is not you. Observer sees in the stool characteristics of how your mind thinks, but the stool is not you. The Absolute has in Mind the idea of the Source of all energies of creation; the energy of the idea comes from the Supreme Absolute; but is not the Absolute.
The Source of creative energies is not the Absolute but comes from the Absolute. An observer sees in the fish and the plant characteristics of how Divine Mind wills, but those creatures are not the Supreme Absolute.
10\.
After speaking thus, the Authentia gazed for long into my eye. I trembled at the presence of It in me.
When It released the gaze, another vision came: in Divine Source, the Light and the Darkness; images of Powers no human could number, came forth as in a mighty storm; our Cosmos growing without bounds, and the Divine Fire of Creation was encircled by a most mighty number of stars with planets; when subdued it had come unto a gentleness, and in the centre of the encirclements the Living Darkness breathed, the Cosmic Mind breathed, and governed.
So, understand the Cosmos expands and contracts beyond The Way. Understand the Absolute is the source and cause of Infinity.
11\.
And I say. Lord, whence then The Way?
In His place where He was created exists The Way, and He occupies a section of Space.
The Way sent forth Its Word and established the Three Domains; installed all the Laws of order, authority, and regulation for the Domains: the Domain of Soul energies, Domain of Matter energies, and the Domain of Spirit energies.
All three domains exist in the same space; the energies and Powers of them are not joined but separated by the Great Choristó. Each with energies and powers of its kind, each having beings of its kind. And, one species changes not to another species.
Each Domain is a universe, each according to its type. The three universes are below the universes in the Divine Chaos for those we canst know. Protected we are from them.
For such, The Way is endowed with Divine Reason. Manifest and unmanifest Energies of all three Domains happen in the same space. All things flow as regulated by Laws, all, by The Way it is; The Way it shall be; all things according to Plan and Process, according to Order and Structure, and each to its own Path.
The Divine Play of Chaos in Creation flowing from the Supreme Absolute, is separate from The Way, but Divine Chaos is in all that are unmanifest and manifest, for that is The Way.
And when I saw these things, I understood by reason of The Way, the higher Reason and Sense which flows from Divine Mind, is Present in All.
12\.
But as I was in great astonishment. The Authentia saith to me again: Didst thou behold in The Way the Archetypal Forms whose being is before beginning without end?
And when I saw these things, I understood: the Forms proceed from The Supreme Absolute and all creation seen and unseen, from the smallest to the largest; all universes seen and unseen, follow and copy the Forms existing in the Mind of the Supreme Absolute.
13\.
And I enquired: Lord, how pray, how worship we The Way as it is a manifestation of the Word of The Source?
Only one manner of worship but pray not. Pray not, for the Way giveth Itself completely, and offers no more than its entirety. Worship the Way by flowing in its Divine Flow. Meditate the gentle centre flows, the fast-moving current; junior students on the Path seek the side streams for their journey's interesting excursions: eddies, swamps, lakes, groundwaters and mountain streams---lifetimes of journeys, then back to the Divine Flow. To worship the Way, become one with It; flow according to the Laws, its Peace, Harmony, Simplicity, Humility, and Loving-kindness.
14\.
And I say: Lord, whence then have Mother Nature's elements their being?
To this He answer gives: From Divine Will, didst Mother Nature receive The Way; gazing on the Aethereal Cosmos Beautiful, she did copy it, making Herself into a manifest cosmos throughout the galaxies, by means of her own elements and by the births of souls she filled it with life and Gods for all species. Throughout, Her Presence abides and through her the soul knows The Way. For as above, so be it below; the Forms are in the Divine Mind.
15\.
And I say: Lord, whence hath Reason come to some beings but not all, and how the size of a soul?
To this He answer gives: Straightway from out the downward elements of The Way, God's Reason as the Word leaped up to Mother Nature's pure formation, and was at-oned with Her, for it was co-essential with her, and they loved one another in embrace.
And Nature's downward elements were thus left reason-less, so as to be simple matter with reasonless minds, but since The Way, Her upward elements were endowed with souls with reasoning minds.
And from the downward elements Nature brought forth living organisms and beings without reason, for She did not extend the Reason of the Way to them.
And She also brought forth elements, entities, and beings with reason, each with minds of their own, each to its own degree. In air were beings winged; in the fluids beings who swim and walk, and on the surface all kinds of beings, all as Nature-Mind willed. From Her bosom Divine Mother Nature produced all life forms, and all beings with soul, and incorporeal souls, and in Soul Domain she placed incorporeal souls of all species in soul worlds. Souls are of the dimensions of Soul Domain, their size that of a complex thought.
And endowed She on them mortality and reproduction when incarnated, and with minds skilled in cunning, intention, knowledge, and love for the cosmos.
And She set gods in soul heavens, to each species its own, through whom souls experience the Divine Nature of Soul Domain.
16\.
And I held in mind the question: Whence then, Lord, have the gods their elements and their being?
To this the Authentia answer gives: From Divine Will, didst the Spiritual Domain receive Reason and the Sense of divinity from The Way. For by gazing on the Divine Mind of the One, didst The Way copy the Forms; making himself all the incorporeal aethereal Spirit domains by means of his own elements; by the births of spirit beings, he filled it with life, each species to its own purpose. And endowed He them with immortality, and with minds skillful of wisdom and love for the Divine. And set Gods in spirit heavens, to each species its own, through whom spirit beings experience the Divine Nature of Spirit Domain.
17\.
I held in mind the question: Lord, be so other earths and other humans in the Cosmos?
To this the Authentia answer gives: Thy race exists on Earth, nowhere in the Cosmos but in this world. Uncountable by the mind of thy race the number of other worlds; with living beings of diverse species all be different to living in their worlds. Unfathomable to the human mind are those worlds; more ancient than humankind, some superior in Reason; each embracing Nature and Aethereal energies and whatever Chaos suitable for their nature.
Unfathomable to minds of your race are the number of species, even on Earth; all are beings of the energies of the entirety of Nature's Cosmos.
18\.
And I held in mind the question: Lord, then of what kind of being am I, a human.
To this He answer gives: Thou are a mixed-race species, a rare kind by Divine Grace of thy Father created. Mixed, hence thy desire and love for Divinity and the Immortals, but also thy desire and love for Nature and the Cosmos.
Hence thy desire for Love and Divinity, to this human species ye became.
Thou art desirous of Divinity, Kindness, and Immortality, and so shalt achieve. Thy soul to Earth came for awakening the seed of Spirit introduced in thy heart; to sanctify the minds of the soul and turn from downward thinking; to love All and love the Divine.
Of this kind art thou, no other type from below mayest move upward to cross the Great Choristó between Soul Domain and Spirit Domain, and thou shall pass through the Domain of Matter many times on Earth. For your kind, Earth is the School for Souls to learn Divinity.
Of this kind, thou art creators; all souls are creators for having Mother Nature inside; thou too art a creator as all spirits are creators for having The Way inside; Children of the Source have creative Powers, with their minds each create outer and inner realities of their existence.
19\.
And my mind, held the question, for perplexed I was: But how be it so, for a creature to change its species, mortal as it is, fixed by Divine Will of Mother Nature, to a species immortal, of an incorporeal and aethereal kind in Spirit Domain?
To this the Authentia answer gives: Thou shalt be born again. Thy soul be dismantled and from it a spirit be fashioned anew; not without thine own power, not without thine own energy, not with thine own power, but by love, desire, and harmony in the Laws of The Way.
20\.
Disturbed in mind I was but held steadfast, and held in mind the question: Lord, I so desire to know how this can be, and what must I do, for I do desire with all my soul and minds the beauty of divinity, and the nature of Immortals. How can I, a mortal soul, know that! which is beyond my species?
To this the Authentia answer gives: Wisdom is at first disturbing to the minds of souls. For the mind of soul to learn what thee wish, seek audience with thy God, the Father of thy species. In presence of His powers come thee to know all which the Father wills thee know.
The wisdom for spirit, from the Visions I give, are partial. When receive the Visions that the Father in Heaven bestow, shalt thee have in-spirited wisdom\--for the Father speaks to thy spirit He placed in thee.
21\.
And I held in mind the burning question, like a fire in my soul, and fear I may be abandoned in this Divine Vision; \"Lord, how shall know to at-one with the Mind of the Father in Heaven, I am a mortal, Sire!\"
To this He answer gives: To at-one with the Father in Heaven, the spirit must Love the Immortals, and surrender to the passions of higher-self. Dost thee desire at-onement? Dost thee Love the Immortals so to Surrender all that is important to thy soul?
22\.
My spirit searched my soul, and the fire of impassioned love for divinity, and what immortals be overcame me, and my soul pledged its alienation from all that it knows. And I saw in all living beings The Way and Divine Mother Nature, and I became one with it, and surrendered myself to flow in the Divine Way.
Of a sudden I was violently swept into like a Charybdis of energies mixed in kinds, and swirled downward; my heart stopped, no breath sustained me, and when my reasoning ceased, I awoke in Divine Peace Beautiful; tears of a Joy I did not know to exist, flowed from me.
My mind's eye opened to see yonder into a land of fantastic Light and aethereal structures, and aethereal beings. A world of various kinds of bright Light.
I had been swept away to the Domain of Spirit. Like the top of a mountain in a Heaven of some sorts; which my soul and minds had desired with all its powers and energies.
With no soul minds present in me, and my rational mind quieted, my spirit heard the voice of an Immortal from Heaven. Not with mine ears. I observed not with eyes. But all with knowings in my breast, throat, and head.
The voice knoweth in me: \"Hold in your higher-self what you want to know\".
23\.
I held in my heart's desire, \"Lord, I desire to know where am I?\"
The voice knoweth in me: In your language, you call this Heaven, Land of Pure Bliss; and its Father, Lord Illimitable Light. The Lord is your Father, for in your heart you carry His seed; your spirit is His progeny. You are known here. We are family. Here, all are children of God the Father, and God the Mother in Heaven.
24\.
I held in my heart desire the question: My Lord, I asked of Lord Authentia, but was sent here for the answer; I beg enquire how possible for a Nature creature of my soul species, be born again? To become of the Immortal and wise species in this Heaven. I am sent to request from the Father of Heaven, to beg this wisdom.
The voice knoweth in me: \"As you speak to me, you speak to the Father. All is known, all are connected\".
25\.
I held in my heart desire the question: \"Who art thou Lord, I do not see thee, how shall I address thee?\"
The voice knoweth in me: \"My name, mortals do not say, for it be not a sound. But my presence you feel in higher Sense; that be I. My body appears not to your eyes, for it is not of the Domain of your eye, nor of your soul, it is of Aether and spirit.
As you are, you do not have faculties to see me, but soon you will.
Who I am, is your spirit protector. To you, I am whomsoever your heart convinces your brain mind. Your brain mind needs an idea from its domain. How you address me, depends on your conviction of higher Reason of the Senses.
Know me as the Immortal who observes you, in your world, from on high.
26\.
I held in my spirit-desire the question: \"My Lord, for to take the good news of the gift of divine rebirth, to my species, mayest I know thy wisdom, Lord; wherefore my species, rare, granted the privilege of this miracle; what have I, a mortal of Nature, done, to deserve the blessing of nobility?\"
The voice knoweth in me: \"Still the minds of your soul. Attend with the minds of Higher Sense, and observe the knowing of the wisdom I show in your spirit.\"
\"When the Divine Source, through the Word created The Way, to which It created also the Domains; also, so, The Way created the heavens for spiritual beings of all species. The Way established Laws to order and regulate, to discipline and structure each cosmos, each to its own.
Spiritual beings work in The Way, along with the Laws; serving The Way, as it is for them the Supreme's Energies manifest.
27\.
Again, still the minds of your soul. Attend with the minds of Higher Sense, and observe the knowing of the wisdom I shall in-spirit in you.
Upon a time, aeons ago, The Way sent forth on a mission, an Immortal of highest stature and powers, to discipline a nation of soul beings who were cruelest amongst all other; marauding, inflicting untold suffering on all life. It is the Law to inherit the consequences of actions. No soul-nation who disregard The Way will abide; all its beings will be humbled for four generations until its old ways are no more in their nature. That is the Law, of group cause and consequences.
That Immortal, before energizing the judgement and punishment of the Law upon them; that ancient and most noble spirit, by own volition, took incarnation on that world and lived as one of them. Learning their ways and their minds, to understand why they do that which they do. At risk of invoking the wrath of the metaphysical Laws, He came to know their souls and their soul minds.
Of own volition, That noble one taught the soul-rulers the benefits of kindness and willing participation, of limiting brutality, and having consideration and respect for those whose labours are needed. Strange were those teachings to them; yet they heeded; even as soul beings are by nature autocratic despots, and lovers of control over others, by nature exacting their will by intimidation, crafty design, force, disrespecting of their rivals, hoarding resources, and exploiting with denigration the weak.
Howsoever, the rulers of that world observed from the teaching the material benefits, of useful kindness, and how their affairs profited from it.
However, the enemies of the Immortal were not the incarnated soul-beings, but the incorporeal soul tribes who syphoned off the evil energies of that world. They made evil rulers tyrants. They made greed-filled officials criminals. The incorporeal rulers, the Princes of Darkness --- for their domains, are devoid of Bright Light, for they exist in Nature's original Light of Darkness\--it was they who ruled by proxy.
The incorporeal beings of darkness fed on the energies of lower-soul passions, created by unrestrained beings: chaos, fear, anger, greed, envy, and overindulgence.
For that be the reason they are hungry souls; they are drained by their incorporeal overlords. Unconstrained souls are hungry souls, who never find their enough. And that be what souls of dark light feed on; they who drink that bitter sap.
To the incorporeal entities that lorded over them, the Immortal was a threat; He altered their source of nutrition and energy. Therefore, they conspired and murdered the animal body in which the Immortal had incarnated.
Not taking again another body, the Immortal ascended to The Way to seek council. He requested his approach to solve the problem in that world, to teach compassion, to be assessed, as it was not before done in that manner. The High Council of The Way assessed and found His approach of sufficient benefit, as a first measure of the Law.
28\.
Upon that, the Divine Way created a new Heaven, of which that noble Immortal would be the Father, and a Mother. For he was to populate the Heaven with Immortals of Its own and unique nature. The Way did this as a Mercy for helping soul beings in like manner, all over the Cosmos.
That Immortal is our God. That Heaven, is our Heaven. That Mother is our Mother. That Father is our Father.
God, by nature of male and female energies, manifests God the Father and also God the Mother of Heaven. From within Itself, God begot spirit children for our Heaven, and they were schooled in skills of Chrestotes, Loving-kindness, Humility, and Simplicity, known to your elders as the Lotus Teaching.
From God's bosom they were born to be helpers in the Land of Pure Bliss.
God's manifestation as Father of Heaven, known to your elders as God Illimitable Light, so became the Father of all in our Heaven.
God's manifestation as Mother of Heaven, known to your elders as God Jasmin Passion, so became the Mother of all in Heaven.
Mother God cares for all Her children in Heaven, also newborns like you She and her workers suckle and nurture. Father God governs over all organizations and the affairs of Heaven.
Together, They are revered by Soul Gods and Spirit Gods in all domains, for they are universally honoured for their Divine Beneficence.
29\.
The first beings created by Father Mother of Heaven; known to your elders as gods.
The first-begotten were twins; a Son and a Daughter who are the Revered Elders among Immortals in Spirit Heaven and Gods of Soul heavens. And so were born the Divine Lotus Family of our Heaven.
From the energies of Love, Loving-Kindness, Humility, and Simplicity, They create structures. The Light of that Heaven shines bright; well known throughout the Domain of Spirit for its Light and Powers.
30\.
The Father sent children in Divine Lotus Family to incarnate among animals in many worlds; to live among incarnated souls, and learn their ways; even of incorporeal souls in their heavens they learned.
When they learned from living as soul-beings in animal bodies, the Immortals became more Simple, more Loving, more Kind, and more Humble, therefore more Wise, and more Powerful. Their wisdom and spiritual powers exceeded that of all spirit creatures in Spirit Domain.
31\.
Because Immortals of the Land of Pure Bliss work in all of the Soul Domain, some soul-beings became enamoured with Lotus Family beings.
They learned of our higher wisdom, our powers from supreme love, and powers from loving-kindness, and powers from simplicity, and powers from humility. Many souls fell in love; desiring to become like us; some advancing in their own measures of love, each to the capacity of her own species.
Our Father in Heaven, observed how some souls changed because they loved the Divine Lotus Family.
Lotus Family of the Land of Pure Bliss needed multitudes more helpers, for the Cosmos increased in size and population.
Thererefore, our Father, because of His illimitable compassion for all, created the Soul Academy for Divinity. The School for advanced souls, who burn with desires for at-onement with Immortals, and higher wisdom, and for immortality. Those souls, said the Father, can learn and earn the wisdom to be metamorphosed into Lotus Family Immortals.
Those soul beings, of whom you are one, will become Immortal, with all the skills to work among soul beings in all of Nature Domain. You are becoming an immortal member of Divine Lotus Family. As we speak, you are in process to be born again, a new species of being.
32\.
Junior students in the School, although advanced in their love and kindness, are even so still despotic and destructive in nature, and easily tempted. Therefore, the worlds which the Father makes for the School are repeatedly ruined, inevitably. But not by malice of the students, but peradventure by heedlessness or offensiveness. When ruined, another School is made anew; in a world where the body of the most suitable animal is transformed, to host the hybrid soul-spirit.
In your time, the Academy is on Earth, and the spirit-carrier body was modified from the human species. The human, a hybrid-species animal, with soul and spirit, between two Domains, the human does not birth new souls by procreation as do other soul-beings. No, its procreations receive souls only from Butterfly Path School and the Law of Karma.
From over the cosmos, souls who developed more loving, more kind, and more humble than their own type. They who learned to love higher than the nature of mortals, and who desire to become like Immortals --- are drawn to study this academy. They receive the seed of spirit from our Father's energy, which they shall germinate and magnify, and they will be made holy and wise when their loves mature.
On Earth, you named the academy, Butterfly Path School. For you liken the soul to a caterpillar. Similarly, the soul will mature, its sanctified essence be dismantled and made into a magnificent being of another species, of another Domain --- a butterfly\--an Immortal of the Lotus Family, in our Land of Pure Bliss.
33\.
In my heart mind's loving desire, I held the question: My Lord, for to take the message of this miracle to my species, mayest I know the secret word my kind must do; for to become wise in the ways of Immortals?
The voice knoweth in me: Give me your higher minds, and with higher sense have the vision of the Four Conditions.
When thy minds have turned as strangers to the manners of the world, thy love for all made by Divine Source and Divine Word, and thy self-respect and self-knowing, and thy love for Heaven prepares thee.
The Path is self-teaching; active in all humans since the foundation; most equitable, most compassionate; from sunrise to sunrise learning opportunities for your need.
Teach wisdom appropriate to the grade of the student; wisdom which refine in layers over lifetimes. What are pearls of wisdom to one, are pebbles in the mud to another. Do not give what is sacred to the unready, dire consequences will be for thy account.
Mental gymnastics entertain the bodily mind; self-righteousness fuels the 1st mind; imitation holiness entertains the 2nd mind; complacency lames the 3rd mind; but true devotion to Heaven is possible for all students. What is vital mystical communion for one, is premature for another; what is worship and devotion to Heaven for one, is incomplete for another. What is surrender of the soul to Heaven for one, is contrary to reason for another. The teacher is a master of discerning; of loving-kindness guided by its Guardian. Few can teach all grades.
34\.
The voice knoweth in me. \"Thou ask with the fifth mind, How, o Lord, can I know to be a teacher in the Path?\"
The Path is not taught; it cannot be understood with the compounded elements, by means of which thou think, see, touch, and hear. As you live the Path and reflect, you become wise, in the aethereal minds of higher self.
Teach and heal, you must, but little can be said. Seniors on the Path have skills of healing their own energies; also heal the energies of thy community and students.
Who is your student?
Juniors need wholesome soul food, discipline and self-respect.
Median students are not interested in your sermons, the philosophy is too simple, too humble, and too compassionate. They love theories of exceptionality and hidden secrets, always self-contradictory, fanciful, and complicated; prized above all for them is the so-called secret alternatives to walking the true Path.
Teach without desiring results.
Craft excellent seeds. Sow the right seeds for the right soil.
Water gardens by your humbleness, compassion, simplicity, and self-control, joy, and awe, gratefulness, and healing energies .
35\.
The voice knoweth in me: \"Your heart inquires; from what matter and what womb come humans to this birth, or of what seed?\"
Wisdom that understands in silence, such is the Matter and the Womb, from which humans are Reborn. And God the Father in Heaven, of His spirit, donated He a seed. The wisdom that understands in silence is inherent the higher self, by Grace of God.
36\.
The voice knoweth in me: \"You inquire; who is the sower of the seed? \"
The sower of the seed is the Will of God your Father in Heaven.
The divine seed is in the heart-mind of every student in Butterfly Path.
37\.
I pleaded the questioning of my reason-mind's desire:
\"Of what kind is that which is begotten, Lord? For I have no share of that essence in me, which doth transcend the Senses. The one that is begot, will I be another kind, or God's Child? Or am I a child strange to my Father's race?\"
The voice knoweth in me: \"Thou are born from your Father's seed, in the womb of soul-minds moist with loving-kindness and surrender; and in the womb of spirit-minds alight with loving-kindness, humility, and simplicity, all nurtured by Mother God and her immortals. Newborn, you are suckled and raised by your Mother in Heaven, and kin; you are your Mother's and Father's child, by every means.\"
38\.
Thou ask in thy sixth mind, \"How, o Lord, will I be when the changes come?\"
The voice knoweth in me: I too walked the Path. I too had my former form dismembered and sanctified.
I am no longer touched, yet have I touch; I may be sensed by other beings when I so desire. I may have dimension too, when I so desire. I have no animal features; but when I so desire, I can take the form that an unrefined mind needs.
I am now present with you, but my bright body rests in Heaven, here in the neighbourhoods of Seirios.
Thou see me with the eye in spirit; but what I am, thou dost not understand even with deepest strain of soul, body, and of brain-mind.
Thou may thinketh: \"Arrested from the senses which I had before, now I will see thy greatness equal to thy distinctive form. Even in this, you are untrue. That which is never troubled, which cannot be defined, which no colour hath, nor any figure, which is not changed, which hath no cover or garment, which gives light to spirit-minds, but is imperceptible to all other minds; that which is comprehensible unto its kind alone,\-- \-- that is I.
My name is unique in Heaven. It is my aethereal sound-seal, no other Immortal has. However, we change how we will be perceived for the sake of mortals. The name you have for me, comes from your mind, and changes as your human lifetimes change over cultures and times.
I am to you, what you are ready to receive. You will receive, whom you are ready to receive.
39\.
You ask; Am I incapable of this majestic miracle, to be transformed, O Lord?
Nay, God forbid, o Child!
Withdraw into thyself, and it will come. Will, and it comes to pass. Throw out of work the lower-self desires, and thy Divinity shall come to birth. Purge from thyself the brutish tormentors---the things of matter.
40\.
You ask: \"I have tormentors then in me, O Lord?\"
Ay, no few, o Child; fearful ones and manifold.
You say: \"But I do not know them, Lord.\"
Torment the first is this Not-knowing, child; the second one is Grief; the third, Overindulgence; the fourth, Concupiscence; the fifth, Unrighteousness; the sixth is Materialism; the seventh, Error; the eighth is Envy; the ninth, Guile; the tenth is Anger; eleventh, Rashness; the twelfth is Malice.
For the soul, these are its nature. For those who choose to overcome the torments, the Path is the remedy and the time be as many lifetimes a soul shall need.
41\.
For these, the torment of Not-knowing is a blessing, o Child. For the soul who knows, knows not, and cannot learn wisdom.
The torment of Grief is a blessing, o Child. For the soul who doth not grief, doth not learn to know itself, and doth not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
The torment of Overindulgence is a blessing, o Child. When you see it and look into yourself, you become wise in Simplicity and Balance.
The torment of Concupiscence is a blessing, o Child. For you will be consumed by it and know it intimately, then sanctify it, to form wisdoms.
The torment of Unrighteousness is a blessing, o Child. For unless they have the knowing how you made many beings suffer, no one enters the Land of Pure Bliss.
The torment of Materialism is a blessing, o Child. For without that, how will you learn to turn away, from the manners of the world and the ideas of possessions.
The torment of Error is a blessing, o Child. For without looking into your errors, there is no self-knowledge. With no self-knowledge, there is no Rebirth.
The torment of Envy is a blessing, o Child. Without that, you will not learn to desire to be holy, as are Immortals. Without that holy desire, no Rebirth.
The torment of Guile is a blessing, o Child. Without knowing of which, how will you know when you deceive yourself. Self-knowledge and authenticity, is the Path to Heaven.
The torment of Anger is a blessing, o Child. For it teaches Humility and self-knowing. Without which, no Rebirth.
The torment of Rashness is a blessing, o Child. For upon self-reflection the lingering shame is a great teacher. Humbleness is the Path to wisdom of heaven.
The torment of Malice is a blessing, o Child. For without it you will not look deep into yourself, and know yourself, to take considerable corrective actions. Without self correction, there is no Rebirth.
To know yourself, o Child, is to flow your authentic self in the river, down the Path to Divinity.
To mature your soul, o Child, every human experience is your teacher. Forsake not your teachers; with respect, embrace all.
These tormentors are small in number; under them are more and they creep through the prison of the human body. They force the soul that is placed within, to suffer in her senses. But they depart (although not all at once) from the soul who surrenders to Heaven and higher-self, the soul who knows herself. And such are what establishes the advancement of Rebirth.
42\.
Now, child of the Father, be still, and solemn silence keep! Therewith, shall the healing which flows on us from God our Mother not cease.
Henceforth rejoice, o Child of the Father, for by the Powers of God you are being purified for the articulation of The Way, the Reason, the Divine Word, and for completing the sublime Butterfly Path.
43\.
We are privileged, o Child. Another species shall never have the gift we receive, the Wisdom of God our Father and God our Mother.
Wisdom of God comes to us; as it comes. Knowing is cast out to abide in those who think they know. The Powers that follow Wisdom do I invoke, thy Love for the Divine, thy Self-control and Self-knowing. O Powers most sweet! Let us most gladly bid it welcome, Child! How with its coming doth it chases away mortality and perpetual reincarnations!

How with its coming doth it chases away Poverty and Malaise!
Wisdom of Curiosity hath come to us, and on its coming, o Child, Insanity will flee away to them who give it room. The Powers that follow Curiosity do I invoke, thy Simplicity and Self-knowledge.

O Powers most sweet! Let us most gladly bid it welcome, o Child! How with its coming doth it chases away Pretense, Apathy and Conflict!
Who then doth by His mercy gain this Birth in God, abandoning the body's tyranny, the indignity of living as a predator, and the demands of a soul, knows himself to be of Bright Light and Everlasting Life, and that he doth consist of these, and thus is filled with Bliss.
44\.
In my mind I spoke: By God made steadfast, Lord, no longer with the sight my eyes afford I look on things, but with the energies the Higher Minds give me through the Powers. In heaven am I, in earth, in water, air; I am in minerals and animals, in plants; I'm in the womb, before the womb, after the womb; I'm everywhere! Father, I see the All, I see myself in Mind.
This is, o Child, your Rebirth in process. No more to look on things as by three ways in space extended.
45\.
I begged; Tell me, O Lord: How long doeth Rebirth take?
From conception to birth, child, on Earth not a short time. Some labour for a few more incarnations, some, one. The ultimate rebirth is when the Bright Light opens the eyes of the spirit, in heaven.
46\.
Tell me, O Father: Wherefore my soul's love of the god and goddess who sojourned with me through multitude incarnations? Wherefore be it the love of a beloved, a desire for union? Be that my stumbling block?
Hush! Speak not the manner of they who fear themselves and make sensuousness offensive. That is the talk of soul-people. The divine gift of desire for union of Spirit and soul is thy sacredness.
Nothing of the soul is your stumbling block when sanctified, and all the soul must be sanctified. Souls desire to be embraced, filled, and touched by the Spirit. Its presence at all levels sanctifies, wherever it is invited. Of nature, the soul is sensuous and desirous, all must be touched and sanctified, and desires for holy unions remain. Your deep love, and desire for the two to become one, is the manner of sanctification of all senses.
Sensuousness is your Path.
47\.
Tell me, O Father: How to at-one with the Lord of my soul, my Guardian? How to at-one with Heaven?
When you at-one with the Guardian, the Beloved of the soul, you at-one with Heaven.
With your Self-control find resonance with the holy. In resonance you invite your Lord; in resonance you receive ecstasy of amrita; in resonance you Aware the Spiritual Domain.
Heaven is within and throughout you; in resonance the Gates of Heaven open for you.
48\.
Tell me, O Father: How we shall pray; how speak with Immortals, how to meditate in our hearts?
Attune your minds to divine things. Find your quiet. Seek resonance with the energies of your Immortal Guardian.
Surrender your consciousness to your Love and Desire for oneness with that divine being. Listen, and drink the flow.
Pray for guidance and prepare your minds for outcomes; in time, it become conscious what was received.
Never you know what Law of Karma, from Its goodness will bring. Have assured expectation, and keep that as life moves on. You will become aware of your guidance as you flow about the beauties and challenges of an interesting life.
Devoted students, skilled in higher-self loves and attitudes of reverence, awe, and joy, resonate with an Immortal.
Students skilled in lower-self loves and attitudes, resonate with soul beings and soul deities.
49\.
Tell me, O Father: This Aethereal Body, which is made up of the Powers, is it at any time dissolved?
Hush! Speak not of things impossible, lest you sin, and your Mind's Eye be shut.
The natural body which your senses perceive, is far removed from this magnificent birth.
The first must be dissolved, the last can never be; the first must die, the last, cannot.
Don't you know, you have been born a god, a Child of Heaven? Son and daughter of the Father and Mother of Heaven, even as I am?
But hear me, o Child; the aethereal body shall dissolve at the end of immortality, after eternity. For you shall have the eternal life of an Immortal. At the time of that Consummation, when, after eternity, the Spirit is purified to the nth degree; and by own volition, and by calling, it desires be dissolved into the Divine Source.
50\.
I asked of the god: I would, O Lord, hear the Praise-giving with hymn which the elders said You, o Lord, heard when You were at the Seventh Degree of Powers.
O Child, when I came to the Seventh degree, the Word in The Way, hath not passed on to me more than was writ down, for full well did He know that I should of myself be able to learn all. And hear what I should, and see all things, as to the completion of my Wisdom and Compassion.
He left to me, the making of fair things; wherefore the Powers within me, e'en as they are in all, break into song.
51\.
I asked in all humility of the deity, \"my Lord, mayest I hear, my spirit long to know beautiful things.\"
Be still, o Child; hear the Praise-giving now, that keeps the soul attuned and nourishes the spirit. The Hymn of Rebirth. A hymn I would not have thought fit so readily to tell, had you not reached the end of the Path.
Thus then, o Child, stand in a place uncovered to the sky, facing the western wind, about the sinking of the setting sun, and make thy worship; so in like manner too when you do rise, with face to the east wind. If at night, o Child, face Sirius, for there you are destined.
Now, o Child, be still!
Let every nature of the World receive the utterance of my hymn, i will now sing!
\"Open thou Earth! Let every bolt of the Abyss be drawn for me. Stir not, ye Trees!
I am about to hymn creation's Lord of all Domains; The Way, whom are all Gods in different aspects.
Ye Heavens open, and ye Winds stay still; and let the Word of Source receive my word!
For I will sing the praise of The Way which founded all; who fixed the Worlds, and hung up the Heavens, and gave Souls their Domain and Spirits their Domain. The Way who conjoined with Mother Nature to fill all spaces with living energies and all potentials.
Let us together, Ocean, Wind and Air, Elements, and Organisms, Trees and all living beings, all give praise to the Majestic Reason in Creation, The Divine Way, the Lord of every energy in nature!
'Tis that Divine who is the Eye of Mind; may The Way accept the praise of these my energies!
Ye Energies that are within me, hymn The Way of the Divine Source; sing with my Will, my Energies and Powers, all that are within me!
O blessed Wisdom in me, by thee illumined, hymning through the Light that higher minds alone can see, I joy, I joy in the Joy of Divine Mind.
Sing with me praises all ye Energies of all natures!
Sing praise, my Self-control. My authenticity; sing through me. My humility, sing the praises of the Humble. Sing thou, my loving-kindness, the praises of the Absolute, the True Reality!
We Sing to thou, Absolute which cannot be known, Oh Divine Source, Oh Divine Good, Oh Divine Lord, and thy Way, Life and Light: from us to You, our praises flow!
Heavenly Father and Mother, my Gods in Heaven, I give Thee thanks, to Thee. I owe the Energy of all my spirit Powers to thee. I give Thee thanks, Father and Mother of my species, all because of thy Energies!
Thy Way, O Divine Source, is the Divine Reason. \'Tis The Word that animates my words of praise, The Word that gives Energies their powers, it sings through me Thy praises. Take back Thy Way that is in me, when my Consummation days come!
Thus cry the Energies in me. They sing Thy praise, they flow in Thy Will.
Thou are in us who sing. Our song is energy from Thou. Our praise is Thou energy in praise of Thou. The All that is in us, O Life, preserve. O Light, illumine it. O God, in-spirit it, in me.
It is Thy Mind that plays the Authentia to speak to thy world, that hosts the heaven to which we flow. O Thou Father God, bestower of the Spirit upon us in Thy Domain, we bow in gratefulness and humbleness.
For Thou art God to us. We in the Path, purified in the crucible of human lifetimes, we agonize in the fire. But through this Fire, through Air, through Earth, through Water, and through Spirit, we are sanctified to become one of Thy creatures.
'Tis from Thy Energies I have found Praise-giving; and in Thy Will, the object of my search, was all this time the Pure Land of Bliss; and in my Heavenly Mother have I found rest.\"
52\.
Humbled, and moved, I said: By thy good pleasure have I seen this Praise-giving being sung, O Lord; I have set it in my internal cosmos too.
Therefore, my spirit burst forth in passionate song of praise for our Heavenly Father Illimitable Light:
\"In Thee, O Illimitable Light Father, in Thee, Parent of my Rebirth, Thou are God to me, I Your child! O Father God, thou art the Lord of my Self, thou art the Mind of my mind. Receive from me oblations reasonable as thou would wish; for by thy Will all things have been perfected on my Path.
My spirit gives Praise also to thee, first begotten Son and first begotten Daughter of our Heavenly Father, and to our Heavenly Mother; who nurse and suckle the young, who dispense life-giving nectar of Wisdom.
To Thee my Heavenly Family, I owe my existence; please accept from me my reasonable oblation--- my will, my dedication, my desire for at-oneness, my loves, my minds, my self, and all my hopes and dreams.\"
53\.
To my auspicious and most beloved, lord my Guide on this wondrous journey, I say with passionate love:
\"My Divine Beloved Tara, it is my desire to surrender to thee, to emulate thee, to at-one with thee; for the work thou hast done in me, never can words describe, for the shame I feel for treating thee as I did, never can be explained, forever to be remembered; my soul desires union with thee, I long for Thy presence in me.\"
54\.
The deity sayeth, thus: \"Happy am I, O Child, that thou hast brought the good fruits forth of Truth; products that cannot perish. In spirit, hast thou become a Knower of Thyself, and of our common Sire.
Thy now possess the wisdom beyond all creatures on the earth; the wisdom that the spiritual awakened human is hybrid; mortal because of soul and body, but because of the essential spirit, immortal.
And she who thus hath learned to know herself, to love all living kind, to love God with all her might, and hath turned from the manners of the world, hath reached that Good.
But he, who through a love of soul attractions leads astray, expends his love upon his body, possessions, and soul-mind endeavours---will continue that type of soul existence, of repeated incarnations until the end of its time.
Numerous, are the seniors on Butterfly Path, who embrace The Way.
All too Many, are the juniors who canst yet know It.
A multitude, are those who should embrace the Path to save their souls.
They should do so before the next turning, when everything shall yet again be different.\"
THE END OF \"THE AUTHENTIA\"
## About Wayism
### Senior soul beings from our galaxy come to the human experience to enroll in the school of divinity for souls
The teaching of theWAY is referred to as Wayism by languages who use the -ism suffix.
Teaching of theWAY says that senior soul beings from our galaxy come to the human experience to enroll in the school of divinity for soul beings, to evolve into immortal spiritual beings. All humans are here for that purpose only. The school of divinity for soul beings is called the Butterfly Path, here on Earth.
Wayism is not only the teachings about our school of divinity for soul beings, it is a personal life philosophy, mysticism and lifestyle that flows from teachings of theWAY. People of theWAY, or Wayists, believe that advanced soul beings can evolve here on Earth to be reborn as spiritual beings. To this purpose, spiritual beings from Sukhavati heaven created this school of divinity for soul beings on Earth. Soul beings from elsewhere in our galaxy come here to attend the school by incarnating as human beings. On Earth, the school is referred to as Butterfly Path, which is a simile of how the caterpillar (soul) matures (in wisdom) over time is metamorphosed into an entirely different type of being, a butterfly. All humans are on Butterfly Path. All grades of students share the same space and derive wisdom from human experiences over many lifetimes. theWAY teaches that the main spiritual skills and powers which soul beings must master are Humility, Simplicity, and Compassion.
Junior students on Butterfly Path are much closer to their inherent soul nature, which motivates them to prioritize power-seeking behavior and competing to hoard resources.
The teaching of theWAY explains that the human is the only hybrid form, it has soul, but also spiritual potential which develops when the soul awakens spiritually because it embraces love for the divine and for all other living beings. The soul is the lower-self, and the spirit is the higher-self. The path to becoming an immortal spiritual being involves sanctifying the soul with spiritual energy and merging of the soul with the spirit. Junior students on the Butterfly Path are much closer to their inherent soul nature, and their curriculum is structured accordingly. Their focus is on lower-self needs so prioritize power-seeking behavior and competing to hoard resources. As they mature, they move away from their lower-self nature and towards their higher-self nature.
Junior students always outnumber seniors. Therefore, juniors dominate democratic institutions. Junior souls manufacture most religions, wars, world orders, and empires to serve their base needs. Over time, they mature in spirit and move away from that. It is through human experiences that we learn the wisdom and spiritual skills needed to graduate School and become immortal spiritual beings.
There is only one School at a time, presently the immortals host it on Earth and the animal body used for the purpose is the human. When junior students have created tyrannical regimes that obscure cognitive awareness of the Path, some immortals incarnate as humans to help restore the truth. All human experiences are learning opportunities. Therefore, we will incarnate into all genders, races, ethnicities, and socio-economic classes to learn from a wide variety of experiences. When the planet becomes unviable to host Butterfly Path, the deities, immortals, will move the school elsewhere, as before. School came to Earth about 15 to 18,000 years ago, from which time the hybrid soul / spirit humans started to become dominant in the human species.
Spiritual beings of our species are in essence beneficent, loving, and helpful. They function as personal care givers to soul beings of all types across our galaxy.
When we become immortal spiritual beings, we are freed from the metaphysical law of samsara. Samsara determines that all soul beings will perpetually reincarnate into organic animal bodies of all kinds. All life forms on all planets are said to be alive because of the incarnated soul. There are many millions of different soul species, and several thousand species of spiritual beings. Soul beings are mortal, each species has a determined life span. Spiritual beings have indeterminate life spans, they are said to be immortal.
In the human the soul is said to be the lower-self and the spirit is the higher-self. When the two becomes one, we are reborn, or remade, as immortal spiritual beings. Junior students are dominated by their lower-self nature and are therefore known as soul-people. Senior students are dominated by their higher-self nature and are known also as spirit-people.
The metaphysical Law of Karma regulates our curriculum on Butterfly Path. Like an advanced AI, the metaphysical law senses what learning opportunities we need in terms of human experiences to help us correct our ways and learn higher skills. Karma decides where and with which family and culture our next incarnation will be.
Because there are several metaphysical laws that govern how our school works, there is no God who would or can interfere in the system; it works perfectly.
Everything is energy. Soul beings and spiritual beings have "aethereal" energy bodies of very different types of energy. The energies of material bodies are again different. All three types of energy can, and sometimes do, coexist in the same space, even in the same material body or structure.
We are destined to a spiritual domain where we will exist as immortals, and from where we will do the work that we qualify for by attending Butterfly Path.
Students who decide to drop out of school, or persistently who don't make the grade, do not return to the human experience. They go back to the soul domain from where they came.
People of theWAY live their spirituality through everyday life experiences. For us there is meaning and purpose in everything, life purposeful and meaningful. We are on a dynamic growth Path. Therefore, we must follow the maxim, Own Your Own Mind. We live our spirituality not only in becoming masters of soul and spirit energy management, and nurturing our connections with Divine energies, but in constantly striving to improve our self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-control, and do self-craft. This is the process of evolving the soul into an immortal spiritual being.
Wayism is not and has never been an organized religion, it\'s a personal life philosophy. Therefore, People of theWAY don\'t have ready access to organized group activities and peer support. We must create that within our own means whether online or offline. However, the group of certified teachers of theWAY work hard to make available courses, books, and seminars for your advancement on self and spiritual skills. When there\'s no profit involved, facilities are humble, but excellent in substance.
Overall, the teaching of theWAY is a powerful and life-affirming path that embraces the beauty of diversity and personal growth. It is a path that leads to deep inner wisdom, compassion, and a lasting connection to the divine.
Wayism has no need to advertise or seek members because all humans are on the Path. By virtue of your human birth, something which you chose and had applied for, you are on the Path. All human experiences are your learning opportunities to one day graduate this school. When Karma decides that you need to become a "cognitive Wayist," is when the student is ready, and the teacher will appear. You will encounter deeper Wayist teaching and mysticism and fall in love with it.

## About the Editor
The enigmatic pen name \"Salvar Dàosenglu\" represents a consortium of Wayist monks hailing from diverse corners of the globe, united in their fervent mission to revive and disseminate the essential teachings of theWAY.
These erudite scholars, with roots spanning India, China, Western Europe, Canada, and the United States, bring to bear a wealth of expertise accumulated over multiple lifetimes of immersive study in the realms of Wayism, Buddhism, Yogi Philosophy, Christian theology, and the esoteric wisdom of the world\'s great spiritual traditions.
The very name \"Salvar Dàosenglu\" encapsulates the essence of their sacred charge: an ascetic wayfarer upon the Path, tirelessly proofing and refining the Teaching to ensure its pristine integrity. Yet, in a poignant illustration of the ephemeral nature of language and the ease with which meaning can be obscured by the passage of time, the name itself---an amalgam of Latin and Chinese, each word gravid with layered significance---risks being lost in translation. A whimsical soul, afflicted with a penchant for the absurd, might render it as something akin to \"Road Worker\'s Ointment\"---a charming phrase, to be sure, but one far removed from the profound Wayist Healer which Salvar prefers.
Herein lies the crux of Salvar Dàosenglu\'s mission: to cut through the accretions of centuries and the vagaries of language, to restore the Teaching to its original clarity and potency. It is a task that demands the utmost rigor, discernment, and devotion---qualities that the monks behind the pen name embody in abundance. Through their meticulous editorial oversight and exegetical prowess, they ensure that the works bearing the imprimatur of Salvar Dàosenglu are infused with the undiluted essence of the Way.
To encounter Salvar Dàosenglu is to embark upon a journey of spiritual illumination, guided by a voice at once timeless and urgently relevant. Whether through the pages of their books or in the vibrant digital haven of the Wayist.Life community, seekers will find in Salvar Dàosenglu an invaluable companion and catalyst on the path to awakening.
