## Introduction
In the markets of Kamakura and Puerto Vallarta, between fish scales and morning light, wisdom speaks through unwashed fingers and aching joints. These essays explore how truth flows through our most ordinary moments - in the particular way bus passengers adjust their bodies to make room for strangers, in how butter releases its secrets when properly warmed, in the silent language of geckos watching human drama unfold.
Some might question why a fish vendor concerns herself with spiritual matters, or why divine truth should speak through mundane details of market life. But wisdom lives precisely in these overlooked spaces - in the way blood patterns form on cutting boards, in how elderly women navigate steep streets, in the particular scent that rises when interior meets exterior. These are not metaphors for truth but truth itself, speaking through flesh and bone and daily necessity.
TheWAY teaches us that divine energy flows through all things, not despite their physical nature but because of it. A gecko\'s attention contains as much wisdom as any sutra. The way morning light catches on fish scales can reveal more about reality than abstract philosophy. Even our bodies\' small rebellions - running noses, aching joints, unexpected tears -carry messages about how truth moves through human experience.
These essays emerge from decades of market work and observation, from learning to read both fish freshness and human nature, from finding profound meaning in what others might consider unseemly or beneath notice. They are offered not as polished wisdom but as raw segments of life, each carrying its own flavor of truth.
Like fish, some offerings are best received directly, without the intermediary of too much preparation. These writings attempt to present wisdom as immediately as possible - through physical detail, through bodily experience, through the actual business of living in a world where divine truth flows through every aspect of existence, especially the ones we\'re taught to ignore.
A mouse peers out from beneath my stall as I write this, perhaps understanding something about how wisdom often hides in over looked places. The morning light catches steam rising from newly washed boards, transforming mundane cleaning into momentary beauty. Even my running nose, reacting to market scents, reminds me that truth speaks through all aspects of physical experience, not just the ones we find convenient or pleasant.
Welcome to these market meditations. May they help you find wisdom in your own ordinary moments, in your own body\'s knowledge, in all the overlooked corners where truth quietly waits to be recognized.
## Ten Pesos to Paradise
The bus arrives like a sigh of heated metal, its diesel breath mixing with the afternoon air. For ten pesos, I buy passage into one of humanity\'s most intricate dances - the choreography of bodies navigating shared space. The door wheezes open, releasing a blast of warmth that carries the complex poetry of human presence.
A young man rises as I enter, gesturing to his seat with that particular mix of diffidence and dignity that marks emerging adulthood. I feel the familiar hesitation - that moment of knowing my refusal, though polite, might discourage future gallantry. His offering creates an obligation not just to him, but to all the young men who will come after, who are watching and learning how to be in the world. The exchange of seat for blessing is witnessed by the entire bus, a silent approval that makes him both proud and shy.
Through his rear-view mirror, the driver watches this interaction with professional interest. I see his slight nod - the Japanese woman treated like any other abuela, the social contract maintained. My acceptance of the seat completes a circle of grace that started before any of us were born.
The air is thick with stories told in scent - not the expected symphony of sweat, but rather a complex composition of lives in motion. The sharp note of diesel provides the base, while above it rise the sweet artificiality of AXE body spray (that particular variety favored by boys newly conscious of their bodies), the warm flour-and-corn perfume of fresh tortillas cradled in someone\'s shopping bag, and the subtle chemistry of makeup warming on skin. A woman\'s jasmine perfume mingles with the pungent masculinity of someone\'s aftershave, creating an unintended duet.
Bodies perform their intricate ballet of adjustment - torsos turning sideways to allow passage, shoulders softening to create space, heads tilting to avoid unwanted intimacy. A pregnant woman boards, and seats materialize as if by magic. The collective body of passengers moves like a single organism, guided by unwritten rules of respect and necessity.
Men navigate the delicate geography of proximity - not too close to women (which would be threatening), not too close to other men (which would trigger ancient anxieties about masculinity). Each slight shift of weight, each repositioning of hands on the overhead rail, carries meaning in this silent language of shared space.
A child stands on a seat to look out the window, her mother\'s hand instinctively steadying her without interrupting conversation. An elderly man protects his bag of pan dulce with the careful attention of one carrying treasure. A teenager pretends to sleep, his earbuds carrying him to a private universe, yet his body automatically sways to accommodate the bus\'s motion and his neighbors\' needs.
Here, in this moving metal box, I witness the true measure of civilization - not in grand monuments or written laws, but in the thousand small courtesies that make collective life possible. The way a tall man ducks so others can see the street signs through the window. How a woman shifts her shopping bags to make room for another\'s feet. The practiced choreography of strangers sharing intimate space while maintaining necessary boundaries.
A gecko clings to the outside of the window, somehow keeping pace, its head tilted as if studying this peculiar human ceremony. Perhaps it too recognizes that here, in these unspoken negotiations of space and respect, lies the true heart of human society. Each micro-adjustment, each silent accommodation, forms part of an ancient dance that keeps us human, keeps us whole.
*ten pesos buy grace \-\--*

*some wealth flows through careful moves*
For ten pesos, I purchase not just transport but participation in this daily miracle - how we learn to move together, breathe together, exist together in respectful silence. The bus lumbers through narrow streets, carrying its cargo of individual lives temporarily woven into a single tapestry of shared journey. This too is sacred - this knowing how to be alone together, how to honor boundaries while dissolving them, how to speak volumes without saying a word.
## When Boats Spoke Truth
The pre-dawn air carries diesel\'s particular prayer - that deep-throated hum that vibrates in your chest more than your ears. Old Suzuki-san\'s boat, the Akiko-maru, speaks in a lower register than the others, her engine\'s voice carrying subtle harmonics that only long relationship can teach you to read. My nose catches the slight sweetness in her exhaust that tells me she\'s running a touch rich this morning - not enough to worry about yet, but a message to those who know how to listen.
A spider has made her home in the stern, her web collecting both dew and engine vibrations in patterns that seem to echo the day\'s weather forecasts. The fishermen leave her undisturbed - another set of eyes reading the world\'s signs, another being in relationship with their floating world. This morning her web hangs heavy, predicting humidity that my phone\'s weather app hasn\'t yet registered.
\"Listen,\" Suzuki-san calls me closer, his calloused hand resting on Akiko-maru\'s wooden hull. \"She\'s telling us about the water temperature.\" The planks shift against each other with subtle creaks that remind me of my grandmother\'s knees predicting rain. Modern boats, with their fiberglass shells and electronic sensors, may provide more precise data, but they\'ve lost this intimate language of wood and water, this direct conversation between material and element.
The pattern of exhaust bubbles breaking the harbor\'s surface carries its own messages. \"See how they cluster?\" Yamamoto-san points from his boat, the Kiku. \"Engine\'s timing is just slightly off.\" His diesel\'s deep thrum seems to confirm this observation, a mother\'s vocal patterns shifting to indicate subtle discomfort. The younger fishermen check digital diagnostic tools, but the old ones read these signs with the same instinct that lets them find fish where sonar shows nothing.
\"People think we\'re crazy,\" Suzuki-san tells me, his fingers tracing a seam where planks meet in Akiko-maru\'s hull. \"Talking to our boats, treating them like living things. But wood remembers being alive. Steel remembers the earth it came from. Even fiberglass holds memory of the oil that formed it over millions of years.\" His touch is tender, like checking a child\'s scraped knee. The boat seems to lean into his attention, her timbers adjusting with small sounds that could be sighs of contentment.
The nets, hanging like dark waterfalls from their racks, tell their own stories. Each rope carries the memory of every fish it has embraced, every storm it has endured, every repair that has added to its character. Modern synthetic fibers may be stronger, more resistant to rot, but they lack this capacity for relationship. \"New nets catch fish,\" old Tanaka-san once told me, \"but old nets catch fish that want to be caught.\" His gnarled fingers move through the mesh with the same reverence others reserve for prayer beads.
A young fisherman struggles with his new boat\'s electronic systems, cursing the unresponsive display. Suzuki-san watches with quiet amusement. \"He thinks fishing is about numbers - depth, temperature, sonar readings. But the real conversation happens deeper.\" As if to demonstrate, Akiko-maru\'s engine note changes slightly, adjusting to some shift in current or load that only she can sense. Suzuki-san\'s hand moves automatically to her throttle, adjusting in response to her request rather than any measurable need.
The harbor water holds its own kind of consciousness, reflecting back the relationships between boats and humans like a mirror catching both physical and spiritual light. When Akiko-maru backs from her berth, her wake patterns tell stories about propeller angle, about hull balance, about the particular way wood parts water after decades of practice. The younger boats, for all their power and precision, seem somehow less present in this dialogue between vessel and element.
Modern fishermen often switch boats without ceremony, treating them as interchangeable tools rather than partners. But the old ones know better. \"Each boat has her own soul,\" Yamamoto-san explains, letting Kiku find her own way through a tight turn. \"They remember how you treat them, whether you listen to their needs or just demand performance.\" His engine\'s contented purr seems to confirm this - the deep satisfaction of a being who knows she is understood.
Even the rust patterns on metal fittings carry meaning to those who know how to read them. Like wrinkles on a familiar face, they tell stories of storms weathered, of loads carried, of trust earned through long partnership. The newer boats, with their powder-coated perfection and replaceable parts, seem somehow less honest, less engaged in the real work of aging alongside their human companions.
A seasonal storm approaches, its pressure changes making every wooden boat in the harbor shift and murmur. Their hulls remember similar storms from years past, their timbers adjusting microscopically to prepare for what\'s coming. The spider in Akiko-maru\'s stern rebuilds her web in a more protected corner, adding extra anchor points that echo the boat\'s own preparation for heavy weather.
*diesel hums deep truth*
*while spider reads storm\'s coming \-\--*
*wood remembers sea*
\
*(what boats whisper here:)*
*trust flows through patient practice*
Tonight, after the day\'s catch is sold, these boats will continue their quiet conversations with tide and time. Their woods will expand and contract with temperature and moisture, their metals will sing with the day\'s accumulated heat, their engines will cool with gentle pings that carry messages about how well they were used. Tomorrow, human hands will again enter these ancient dialogues, finding new ways to let beauty emerge from the partnership between vessel and voyager, between tool and purpose, between the seemingly animate and inanimate.
Perhaps this is what we\'re really losing in our rush toward digital perfection - not just traditional skills or knowledge, but the very ability to enter into deep relationship with the things that share our journey. When we reduce boats to collections of data points, when we treat engines as merely interchangeable power sources, when we see nets as simple tools rather than archives of experience, we miss the profound wisdom that can only come through long communion between being and purpose.
## The Language Beyond Words
His hands catch my attention first - not the delicate, precise fingers one might expect from an artist working with such fine detail, but hands that speak of hard work, of wrestling beauty from resistant materials. They remind me of the fishermen\'s hands at my market, carrying that particular strength that comes from years of letting work shape flesh into wisdom.
I find Pedro Tello\'s stall near the Cuale River by following the trail of light he creates - not physical illumination, but the kind that emanates from art that knows its own truth. His \"Tellographs\" catch the morning sun, their scratched surfaces revealing layers of color that shouldn\'t exist in what appears to be simple black photographic paper. Like life itself, the surface darkness contains hidden gold, vermillion, ochre - colors that emerge only through careful wounding.
My own Japanese vocabulary fails to capture what I see, and my Spanish stretches only to basic greetings. Yet when Pedro smiles in welcome, I recognize something that needs no translation - that particular authenticity that comes from someone completely comfortable in their own being. His presence carries that rare combination of strength and gentleness that reminds me of my fish market teacher - someone who has nothing to prove and therefore can simply be.
He shows me his technique, using gestures more than words. The gubia in his hand moves like my fish knife - precise yet unhesitating, finding the lines that already exist beneath the surface, waiting to be revealed. I understand immediately - this is not creation so much as discovery, not imposing but unveiling. Like theWAY itself, the truth was always there, needing only the right touch to emerge.
Then I see it - the piece that stops my breath. A human heart formed by twisted branches, butterflies emerging from or perhaps returning to its chambers. The symbolism would seem heavy-handed from a lesser artist, but Pedro\'s treatment carries that light touch that transforms metaphor into truth. The scratched surfaces catch light like fish scales, revealing deeper colors with each shift of perspective.
My hand moves unconsciously toward my chest, and Pedro nods, understanding blooming in his eyes. No words pass between us, but our fingers trace similar patterns in the air - his remembering the creation, mine trying to express what I see. We share a laugh at our linguistic limitations, but beneath our stumbling attempts at verbal communication, something deeper flows - the recognition of how art, like theWAY, speaks in languages older than words.
When I purchase the piece, our hands meet in more than simple transaction. His grip carries that particular warmth that comes from someone who touches life directly, without filters or pretense. My own fish-scaled fingers recognize the honesty in his calluses. We bow slightly to each other - my Japanese gesture met by his Mexican dignity - and something passes between us that transcends both cultures.
The heart and butterflies now hang in my small apartment, catching morning light just as they did by the river. Each day, they remind me of what Pedro\'s art teaches - that beauty often lies beneath darkness, that transformation requires both wounding and gentleness, that the most profound truths often speak in languages beyond words.
His technique of revealing color beneath blackness reminds me of theWAY - how wisdom often lies beneath surface appearances, how the path to understanding sometimes requires careful unpeeling of layers, how art and life both teach us to look deeper than first appearances. Like the fishmonger\'s knife finding the natural seams in flesh, Pedro\'s gubia reveals the truth already present in seeming darkness.
*artist\'s blade finds*
*gold beneath black surface while*
*butterflies take wing*
\
*(what art whispers here:)*
*truth flows through wounded beauty*
## When Fish Taught Sacrifice
The pre-dawn air smells of wet stone and dying leaves, carrying subtle notes of what my fish market nose recognizes as ayu - sweetfish making their autumn journey upstream. A spider has built her web between two rocks at the water\'s edge, its strands heavy with mist that catches first light like prayer beads. She too seems to be watching rather than hunting this morning, her usual prey forgotten in the presence of something more profound than mere feeding.
Through the clear water, I can see them coming - their silver bodies transformed by spawning colors, their scales already showing the wear of their impossible journey. Old Tanaka-san stands beside me on the bank, his fisherman\'s hands unusually still. \"Look,\" he whispers, pointing to where the stream narrows between ancient rocks. \"They remember what their bodies have never known.\" The fish gather there, reading currents their ancestors mapped generations ago, preparing for what their cells tell them must be done.
The first one makes its attempt at the small waterfall - its body arcing through morning light like a question hurled at heaven. It falls back, but there\'s no rest, no hesitation before the next try. Again and again they leap, their flesh literally coming apart with the effort. \"Some people used to catch them here,\" Tanaka-san tells me, his voice carrying equal measures of sadness and understanding. \"Easy prey, they said. Like taking offerings from a temple.\"
A young fisherman approaches the bank with net in hand, but the old man\'s look stops him. \"These ones are not for taking,\" he says simply. The younger man starts to argue - about economics, about efficiency, about how many fish are simply going to die anyway. But there\'s something in Tanaka-san\'s posture that brooks no argument. He stands like the rocks themselves, a guardian of mysteries that mere profit can never comprehend.
Through my market-trained eyes, I can see how their flesh is already changing - becoming both more fragile and more dense as their bodies convert everything to the reproductive effort. A female breaks the surface, her rounded belly carrying next spring\'s possibility. The wound on her flank where she scraped against rock doesn\'t bleed - all her blood is needed for what\'s ahead. Everything about these fish now serves a single purpose, a biological imperative transformed into something like grace.
\"Watch their eyes,\" Tanaka-san murmurs. Unlike the glazed look of fish in my market displays, these eyes hold something fierce and focused - a consciousness transformed by purpose. They don\'t avoid the difficult patches of water now but seek them out, their bodies somehow knowing that the hardest path leads to the best spawning grounds. Natural selection written in water and will.
The spider in her web catches a small insect but doesn\'t move to wrap it. Like us, she seems transfixed by the larger drama unfolding below. Some mysteries demand complete attention, ask us to suspend our normal patterns of predation and consumption. Even the stream\'s resident herons stand unusually still, their usual hunting forgotten in the presence of this ancient ritual.
*torn flesh fights falls*
*while spider holds morning\'s web \-\--*
*sacrifice speaks truth*\
\
*(what waters teach here:)*
*grace flows through holy effort*
A city family arrives with expensive cameras, but their chatter dies as they absorb the scene. The children, usually so quick to make noise, fall naturally quiet. Something here commands reverence without requiring explanation. The father starts to pose his daughter by the water for a photo but thinks better of it. Some moments ask only to be witnessed, not captured or consumed.
\"Every year fewer return,\" Tanaka-san says, his weathered face showing grief that transcends simple economics. \"The sea is warmer, the rivers carry different chemicals, the old pools have been filled in for parking lots.\" Yet still they come, their bodies remembering maps written in genetics rather than paper, their determination transforming mere instinct into something like destiny.
Night is coming, but I cannot leave. The fish continue their effort in darkness, their splashes writing a kind of music against the stones. Tanaka-san has been standing guard all day, his presence keeping away those who might not understand why we sometimes must simply witness rather than take. The spider has remade her web higher up, leaving clear the space above the water where fish leap toward their fate.
This is what the commercial fisheries can never understand - that sometimes relationship means choosing not to prey, that true sustenance comes not just from what we take but from what we protect. Their efficient harvesting leaves no room for reverence, no space for the sacred act of standing back in awe.
Tomorrow I\'ll return to my market stall, to my daily dance of predator and prey. But tonight, I stand witness to a different kind of consumption - of flesh consumed by purpose, of individual life surrendered to species\' survival, of desire transformed into destiny. The fish have become their own offering, their struggle its own kind of grace.
The spider catches the day\'s last light in her web, each drop of dew holding a different facet of this mystery. Below, the fish continue their ancient work, teaching anyone who will truly watch about what it means to be utterly consumed by purpose, about how the holiest predator might sometimes be the one who chooses not to take.
## The Language of Lines and Tides
Before dawn, when the tourist bars have finally quieted and the beach is briefly empty of sunbathers, I watch the fishermen emerge from their homes in the Gringo Gulch and 5 de Diciembre neighborhoods. Their movements have that particular economy that comes from decades of predawn risings - no wasted gestures, no unnecessary hurry. Their hands cradle cups of coffee that steam in the humid air, the same hands that will soon sort through nets with the delicate precision usually reserved for reading braille.
Even in darkness, they carry sunburn - not the bright red of tourists\' first day regret, but the deep permanent tan that speaks of generations working under open sky. Their skin has that weathered quality that reminds me of the fishermen in Kamakura, as if wind and salt have carved wisdom directly into flesh. Some things about fishing life are universal, written in body rather than language.
The younger ones check their phones for weather apps now, but the elderly fishermen still read the dawn sky with squinted eyes, testing the air\'s weight on their tongues. Their bodies have become living barometers, tuned to subtleties no satellite can capture. When don Miguel rolls his shoulder against approaching rain, his gesture carries more authority than any forecast.
Their boats - pangas they call them here - rest on the beach like sleeping birds, each one bearing scrapes and patches that record years of dialogue with the sea. I recognize the particular way they test the smoothness of wood with their palms, the same gesture I\'ve seen a thousand times in my fish market. Hands that know their work need no eyes to read quality.
The nets they mend in the afternoons have a different language than those I know from home, but the grammar of care is the same. Each knot speaks of knowledge passed down through calloused fingers, each repair a conversation between present need and ancient technique. Sometimes tourists stop to photograph this \"quaint\" activity, missing how the fishermen\'s fingers move with the precision of surgeons, each stitch measured to match the size of their intended catch.
When they speak of the bay, they use terms I\'ve never heard in either Japanese or English - words that describe specific combinations of current and wind, particular behaviors of fish at certain depths, the subtle differences between fifteen kinds of underwater terrain. Like the Inuit with their many words for snow, these men have developed a vocabulary shaped by intimate knowledge of their world.
One elderly fisherman, his eyes the particular pale blue that comes from decades of looking into water-reflected sun, showed me how different fish leave different marks on fishing line - each species with its own signature of wear. \"The line remembers,\" he told me in Spanish heavily flavored with local idioms, his fingers running over nylon with the same reverence I\'ve seen priests handle prayer beads.
They return as the morning joggers begin to claim the beach, their boats heavy with silver fish that catch the rising sun. The tourists are starting to emerge from their hotels, ordering their breakfast mimosas, unaware of the ancient dance that\'s just played out between men and sea. The fishermen\'s movements are slower now, but still precise - each gesture honed by necessity and time into something approaching ceremony.
Their catch will end up in restaurant kitchens and market stalls, transformed by other hands into meals that visitors will photograph for social media. But here, in this liminal hour between night and day, I witness something raw and real - a relationship with the sea that no menu can capture, that no photograph can convey. It lives in the particular arch of their backs as they haul in nets, in the unconscious way they move in rhythm with their boats, in hands that can read water\'s moods through the vibration of a line.
As they secure their boats for the day, their bodies carry that specific fatigue that comes from work done fully, with complete presence. The rising sun gilds their skin, turning everyday exhaustion into momentary glory. They pay it no attention, focused on the practical tasks of unloading, sorting, delivering. But I see how the light catches on their hands as they move, how it illuminates the text of experience written in every scar and callus, every sun-darkened crease.
Later, I\'ll buy fish from them for my stall, our transaction conducted more through gesture than words. Their hands will tell me everything I need to know about the quality of their catch, just as mine will tell them I understand the value of what they offer. Some conversations need no translation.
As they clean their boats and sort their catch, they toss scraps to the waiting seabirds - not as casual disposal but as conscious offering. The birds had shown them where to set their lines at dawn, their diving patterns reading the water\'s secrets from above. Now the fishermen return this gift, understanding something profound about the circle of giving that keeps life\'s wheel turning. This is what my fish market teacher meant about true non-interference - not abstaining from the dance of life, but joining it with awareness and respect, taking only what\'s needed and giving back in equal measure.
*dawn fishermen read*

*wisdom flows in ancient tongues*
## When Time Flows Like Honey
In Kamakura, the fish market\'s rhythm is as precise as a meditation bell - 3:30 am for setup, first buyers at 5 am sharp, everything cleaned and closed by mid-afternoon. Here in Puerto Vallarta, time moves differently, like honey in summer heat, flowing at its own insistent pace despite any human attempt to measure or contain it.
My body still startles sometimes at seeing young children playing basketball 11 at night, their laughter bouncing off cobblestones while moths dance around streetlights. In Japan, such hours belong to silence and sleep. But here, these children\'s bodies move in sync with their parents\' working rhythms - waiting at grandmother\'s house until papa finishes his hotel shift at 10, or until mama\'s restaurant closes past normal bedtime hours. Their energy seems unbound by clock time, flowing instead with the real needs of family survival.
The concept of \"mañana\" confused me at first. In Japanese, we have many ways to say no while appearing to say yes, but they\'re all precisely calibrated social signals. Mañana is different - fluid, adaptable, somehow both promise and possibility without being either. Like \"ins\'allah\" in Arab lands, it acknowledges something my fish market teacher tried to explain: that time itself is less rigid than we pretend, that some things will happen when they happen, that pushing the river only tires your arms.
Through my apartment window, I watch the endless stream of workers heading to the hotel zone, packed into buses that groan under the weight of so many dreams of better lives. Their days stretch to nine hours or more, not counting the slow crawl through traffic that steals additional time from their lives. Yet somehow, they maintain that particular warmth of spirit that makes Mexican service famous worldwide - as if they\'ve learned something about how to hold time loosely even while bound by its demands.
The rhythm of meals here still surprises my Japanese-trained stomach. Lunch late afternoon, at 3 or even 5, seems impossible until you understand how the day stretches and bends around work schedules, around heat, around the real patterns of hunger rather than arbitrary rules about when one should eat. The restaurants and shops stay open until 8 or later, their lights creating pools of commerce that extend the day far beyond what nature intended.
In Kamakura, even the vending machines seem to run on schedule. Here, time is more personal, more negotiable. A shop that says it opens at 9 am might really open when the owner\'s child has been safely delivered to school, or when the morning\'s family crisis has been properly addressed. There\'s wisdom in this flexibility that my structured homeland could learn from - an understanding that human needs sometimes trump artificial schedules.
Yet Sundays remain sacred - not to church attendance, which few actually practice despite their profound faith, but to rest itself. The city exhales, shops close their eyes, families gather around tables laden with food that took all day to prepare because time moves differently when it\'s spent in love. Even the tourists seem to slow their frantic pursuit of experiences, as if the city\'s Sunday breath has caught them in its peaceful rhythm.
I think about the two million tourists who flood this city annually, many carrying their homeland\'s rigid expectations of time. They become frustrated when restaurant service operates on Mexican *tiempo*, when shop hours flex like palm trees in wind, when tomorrow doesn\'t mean tomorrow but some fluid point in the possible future. Their bodies remain tight with schedules while local life flows around them like water around stones.
The old fishermen understand this different relationship with time. They know some days the fish will run late, that nature keeps her own calendar. \"El tiempo de Dios es perfecto,\" they say - God\'s time is perfect. It\'s not so different from the Buddhist teaching about being present in each moment, about not fighting what is. Yet they come to this wisdom not through meditation but through lived experience, through understanding how time bends and stretches when you work with it rather than against it.
Tonight, I hear children\'s voices from the basketball court mixing with the sound of their parents returning from late shifts. The air carries the scent of dinner being prepared at hours my Japanese neighbors would find shocking. But there\'s something beautiful in this adaptability, this understanding that time should serve life rather than life serving time. My own body is slowly learning this wisdom, softening its rigid expectations, finding rhythm in what once seemed like chaos.
*midnight children play*
*while parents count time in love \-\--*

## Where Sky Meets Stone
The town square holds memories in its stones - not just the obvious history carved in church walls and colonial architecture, but the living memory of bodies that know exactly how to use public space as an extension of private life. This morning, watching an elderly couple practice salsa steps in the pre-heat quiet, their bodies moving with that particular hesitation of late-life learning, I understand something about how spaces become sacred through use rather than designation.
The husband\'s face carries that mixture of concentration and mild embarrassment common to men learning to dance late in life. But his hands hold his wife\'s with the tender awkwardness of renewed courtship, as if the public square has granted them permission to rediscover touch. Their instructor, barely more than a boy with a portable speaker, corrects their steps with the gentle reverence usually reserved for handling temple offerings.
My own body remembers that evening when I first fell in love with this city - how the mayor and his wife danced in sudden rain, their formal clothes surrendering to water\'s whim, the mariachi band playing louder as if to match the storm\'s percussion. The scene would have been impossible in my structured homeland, where official dignity usually trumps spontaneous joy. But here, under that torrential sky, status dissolved like hair-spray in rain, leaving only the pure democracy of people moving together in shared space.
These squares and parks serve as the city\'s living rooms - necessary overflow spaces for homes too small to contain all of life\'s expansive moments. Young lovers claim benches in the evening, their bodies speaking that universal language of tentative desire. Unlike the tourists who treat public space as a stage for their vacation performances, these local lovers move with the unselfconscious grace of people truly at home. Their intimacy somehow makes the space more public rather than less, adding their story to the square\'s collective memory.
A woman sets up her candy cart near the gazebo, arranging homemade d*ulces* with the same care museums use for precious artifacts. The physical space accommodates her entrepreneurial spirit without requiring endless permits or official sanctions. There\'s wisdom in this flexibility - how public space becomes truly public by embracing commerce alongside romance, exercise alongside art, the sacred alongside the mundane.
Children play tag around the square\'s perimeter while their mothers chat on stone benches worn smooth by generations of similar conversations. Their voices mix with the scratch of palm fronds against colonial walls, with the eternal argument of grackles in the trees, with the periodic bell-voice of wandering vendors. The space holds all these sounds like a bowl holds water, letting them mix and settle into a kind of music unique to this place.
In the evening, as heat finally releases its hold on the day, the square fills with people who seem to emerge from the stonework itself - office workers loosening ties, families with children sticky from *paletas*, teenagers practicing dance moves that mix ancient rhythms with modern beats. The space transforms without transforming - same stones, different purpose, like a temple that serves as both marketplace and sanctuary without contradiction.
A young couple argues near the church steps, their bodies performing that particular choreography of love in crisis. In Japan, such private moments would happen behind closed doors. But here, public space holds private pain as naturally as it holds joy. Tomorrow they might dance here, or sell candies, or teach their own children to walk on these same stones. The space offers itself to all these possibilities without judgment.
Rain comes again, sudden as revelation. Unlike tourists who scatter for cover, locals simply shift their weight, adjust their rhythms, let water redraw the boundaries of possible movement. Their bodies carry the muscle memory of countless such cloudbursts, of countless dances, of countless moments when sky meets stone and creates something holy in the meeting.
This is what my fish market teacher meant about how spaces become sacred - not through official designation but through accumulated human moments, through the slow accretion of lived experience. These squares and parks hold more than history; they hold the present tense of people creating community one dance step, one candy sale, one lover\'s quarrel at a time.
*old couples learn steps*
*while stones remember rain dance \-\--*
*space becomes sacred*\
\
*(what squares whisper here:)*
*life flows best through open rooms*
Tonight, watching young dancers practice between elderly couples and candy vendors, I understand something about how places teach us to be human together. These public spaces serve as crucibles where private lives merge and transform, where cultural assumptions dissolve like sugar in rain, where community is not just a word but a dance we all learn step by step.
## When Saints Dance with Sky
The city transforms itself in December as the Festival of Guadalupe approaches. Like a body preparing for sacred fever, Puerto Vallarta\'s streets pulse with a different kind of heat. The cobblestones, usually content to merely rattle truck suspensions, now echo with the footsteps of pilgrims. Their feet carry that particular weariness that comes from walking toward something holy, their bodies bent slightly forward as if drawn by invisible threads toward the crowned church tower.
Pre-dawn processions wake me even before the fishermen stir. The sound comes first as whispered prayers, then grows into song, finally bursts into brass bands that would seem too loud for this hour if it weren\'t for the way the music somehow softens the hard edges of darkness. The air itself feels different - thicker with copal incense and the sweat of devotion, carrying stories of miracles expected and received.
Vendors who normally sell practical things - vegetables, fish, household goods - now offer candles, flowers, and medallions of the Virgin. Their hands move differently when handling these sacred items, each gesture carrying that extra measure of care that marks the boundary between commerce and devotion. Even the tourists sense something has shifted, their usual casual photographs becoming more thoughtful, more measured, as if they too feel the weight of accumulated faith in the air.
The church steps collect offerings - roses mostly, though I\'ve noticed how different cultures bring different flowers. The scent rises in layers: first the sweet decay of fallen petals, then the sharp green of fresh stems, finally the subtle perfume of blooms just opening. By evening, the steps look like a garden has taken root in stone, each petal carrying someone\'s prayer, each thorn someone\'s promise.
Indigenous dancers arrive wearing anklets of dried seeds that speak their own percussion against the cobblestones. Their feet know steps older than the church itself, their rhythms calling to something that lived here before saints had names. Their sweat drops onto the streets and disappears between the stones, like secret messages seeping into the city\'s foundations. Some dancers wear masks that transform them into beings that blur the line between human and spirit. Their bodies move with that particular fluidity that comes from surrendering to something larger than self.
The food changes too. Street vendors who normally sell practical meals now offer festival foods that appear only during sacred times. The old woman who usually sells tamales now makes *buñuelos* - the oil for frying them has a different scent than her usual cooking, sweeter, more ceremonial. She handles each disk of dough as if it were a communion wafer, her movements carrying decades of festival muscle memory.
Even the city\'s cats seem affected by the change in atmosphere. They walk more carefully around the altars that appear on street corners, their usual swagger replaced by something that looks almost like reverence. Or perhaps that\'s just my own sense of the sacred spilling over onto their ordinary cat business. The grackles in the protected ficus trees sing different songs, or maybe it\'s just that my ears have been tuned to a different frequency by the constant hymns.
At night, the fireworks paint brief gardens in the sky - flowers that bloom and die in seconds, leaving behind smoke that carries dreams upward. The mountains catch the echo of explosions and send them back transformed, like prayers returning as answers. Some tourists cover their ears against the noise, but local children sleep through it undisturbed, their bodies already accustomed to how celebration sounds like warfare but feels like love.
My fish market training helps me read the subtle signs of how the festival affects commerce - which fish are in higher demand for special meals, how the timing of purchases shifts to accommodate ceremonies, how even the haggling takes on a different tone during sacred days. There\'s a particular kind of negotiation that happens only during festivals, when both buyer and seller acknowledge that their transaction is part of something larger than mere economics.
The humidity, usually just a fact of coastal life, now feels like part of the ritual. It carries incense higher, holds sound longer, makes every surface slightly slick with permanent baptism. My clothes stick to my skin with a weight that reminds me of temple air back home - that particular density that builds up in spaces where humans have been praying for centuries.
Today I watched an elderly woman carefully sweep her portion of sidewalk before the procession passed. Her broom was worn from years of similar mornings, but her movements had that extra precision that marks sacred tasks. She wasn\'t just cleaning concrete but preparing a path, each sweep a kind of prayer. This is what my teacher meant about how the sacred flows through the mundane when we learn to see it - how ordinary actions become ritual when done with full presence.
TheWAY teaches us about non-interference, about letting things be what they are. But it also shows us how to recognize when the ordinary transforms itself into something holy, not through our effort but through the accumulated weight of faith and time. This city knows that wisdom - how to hold space for the sacred to emerge through the cracks in everyday life, like flowers blooming between cobblestones.

## When Other Worlds Dance
Colunga\'s otherworldly beings line the Malecón like a procession of dreams made bronze, their patina shifting from verdigris to gold where countless hands have polished their curves. In Japan, we might express such visitations through delicate ink brushstrokes or floating woodblock spirits. Here in Mexico, the other world manifests in solid metal, inviting not just observation but touch, not just contemplation but physical communion.
The morning light catches on their surfaces, creating shadows that dance with palm tree patterns on the concrete. These beings - not quite human, not quite alien, somehow both and neither - remind me of the kami of my homeland, though they speak their truth in a louder voice. Where Japanese spirits whisper through suggestion, these Mexican entities declare themselves with carnival boldness, their metal bodies twisted into impossible poses that somehow feel more true than ordinary human form.
Tourists pose with them for photos, children climb their strange proportions, lovers rest in their shelter. The sculptures bear all this attention with the particular patience of beings who exist simultaneously in multiple realities. Their brass has been warmed by so many hands that certain spots gleam like offerings, marking the places where human touch has tried to bridge the gap between worlds.
My fish market teacher used to say that truth often hides in the spaces between categories - neither this nor that, but something that transcends such simple divisions. Colunga\'s beings embody this wisdom. They are furniture and art, invitation and barrier, familiar and alien, sacred and mundane. Like theWAY itself, they refuse easy classification.
A young girl reaches up to touch one figure\'s elongated hand, her small fingers finding the exact spot where thousands before her have reached. The metal there shines like a star fallen to earth. Her mother starts to tell her not to touch, then stops, understanding something about how some wisdom can only come through physical connection. In Japan, we might bow to show respect. Here, respect takes the form of polish earned through countless caresses.
The bay breeze moves through them, carrying salt and stories, making their shadows shift and dance. From certain angles, they seem to move - not the obvious motion of kinetic sculpture, but the subtle shift of beings who exist more fully in dimensions we can barely perceive. The way they gather, like ancient beings holding council, speaks to something my soul recognizes from dreams and distant memories.
*metal dreams stand while*
*human touch turns green to gold \-\--*
*worlds merge in sunlight*\
\
*(what spirits teach here:)*
*truth flows through stranger fingers*
At sunset, when the tourist crowds thin and the evening light paints everything in impossible colors, I sometimes sit among these beings. Their company feels familiar in a way I can\'t quite explain - perhaps because, like me, they exist between worlds, speaking multiple cultural languages simultaneously. They remind me that some truths are too large for any single tradition to contain, that wisdom sometimes needs to wear strange faces to be seen clearly.
The locals barely notice them now, walking past with the particular blindness that comes from too much familiarity. But I see how their paths unconsciously curve to brush against the sculptures, how their hands reach out for those polished spots without looking, how their children\'s games incorporate these beings as naturally as they do the palm trees and sea waves. This too is wisdom - how the extraordinary, given time and touch, becomes part of our ordinary dancing with reality.
In Japan, such beings might be honored with offerings of sake and rice. Here, they receive the offerings of human touch, of children\'s laughter, of lovers\' whispered secrets. Different cultures, different ceremonies, same recognition that we share this reality with others whose nature we can barely comprehend. Colunga has given form to this truth in bronze and brass, creating not just art but anchors where multiple worlds can meet and mingle.
Tonight, as the sea breeze carries the last tourist voices away, these beings will hold their silent communion under the stars. Perhaps they\'ll discuss what they\'ve learned from all the hands that touched them today, all the stories they\'ve witnessed, all the worlds they\'ve helped to bridge. Or perhaps they\'ll simply stand in their strange dignity, continuing their eternal work of reminding us that reality is larger and stranger than our ordinary eyes can see.
## The Taste of Authenticity
The Saturday market\'s scents hit me in layers - first the sharp metallic tang of fresh blood from the *carnicería*, then the sweet-sour ferment of over-ripe mangoes, finally the smoke from cooking meat that carries tiny particles of someone\'s grandmother\'s secret spice blend. My nose runs slightly from the chili-laden air, and I let it, understanding how this minor discomfort is part of being fully present in this sensory abundance.
Between stalls of bright plastic wares from China and worn leather huaraches, I notice something that stops me - small, dark brown cones stacked carefully like ancient offerings. They remind me of kokuto, the \"black sugar\" of my homeland, and my body responds before my mind can process why - mouth watering, nostrils flaring slightly to catch what my eyes already suspect.
\"Piloncillo,\" says the vendor, his weathered face creasing into a smile that speaks of decades spent working under open skies. Fernando, he introduces himself, his hands thick-knuckled from years of cutting sugarcane, gestures as he explains: \"We press the cane to extract its juice, then cook it down slowly over wood fire until it thickens. No refinement, no chemicals - just time and heat and attention.\" His words carry the particular pride of someone who has inherited wisdom through generations of practice.
\"We pour it into wooden molds while it\'s still hot,\" he continues, miming the motion with hands that know this dance by heart. \"As it cools, it hardens into these cones. Everything from the cane remains - the minerals, the molasses, even tiny bits of fiber. This is sugar as it was meant to be, as the Aztecs and Mayans knew it.\"
My fingers tingle with recognition - this is exactly like kokuto, the unrefined sugar my grandmother used to keep in her kitchen. Different continents, different traditions, same wisdom - keep what nature provides, resist the urge to strip away complexity in pursuit of artificial purity.
When he offers me a taste, breaking off a small piece of the dark cone with hands that know exactly how much pressure to apply, I notice how his wife watches from beside him. Her body holds that particular alertness of someone who has spent a lifetime working in partnership - the kind of attention that comes from years of synchronized movement in shared space. The piloncillo feels dense against my tongue, resistant at first then yielding to reveal layers of flavor my refined-sugar-trained palate had forgotten how to taste.
There\'s smoke there, yes, but also earth - minerals drawn up through cane roots, transformed by sun and rain and soil into sweetness. I taste the ghost of green growing things, the memory of fire, the echo of hands that have touched this sugar on its journey from field to market. My eyes close involuntarily as my body remembers something my mind had forgotten - that food can be more than fuel, that sweetness can carry wisdom, that some things are perfect precisely because they refuse to be perfected.
When I open my eyes, I find them wet - not with sadness but with the particular joy that comes from encountering something completely, uncompromisingly real. Fernando starts to move toward me, concern written in his reaching hand, but his wife\'s fingers brush his arm with the lightness of a butterfly landing. It\'s a gesture so small I might have missed it if I hadn\'t been trained by years at the fish market to read the subtle language of bodies working in harmony. Her touch carries decades of shared understanding, a complete conversation conducted through skin and muscle and bone.
The word rises in my mind: udbhu-kanti. This is what it means to be authentically beautiful - not through refinement or removal or improvement, but through complete embrace of one\'s true nature. The piloncillo doesn\'t apologize for its darkness, doesn\'t try to compete with processed sugar\'s artificial purity. Like theWAY itself, it offers its wisdom through what it has retained, not what it has lost.
On my walk home, my bag of piloncillo warm against my hip, I think about how we humans keep trying to refine ourselves - stripping away everything rich and complex and real in pursuit of some artificial ideal of perfection. We filter our photos, mask our scents, hide our grief, deny our bodies\' messy wisdom. Yet here in my hand is this humble cone of unrefined sugar, teaching me again what my fish market teacher used to say: that wisdom lives in what we preserve, not what we remove.
That evening, as I cook red peppers with small shavings of piloncillo, my apartment fills with a fragrance that speaks of earth and fire, of hands that know their work, of sweetness that carries its own shadow. I place a small piece on my shrine, not as an offering but as a reminder - that like this sugar, we are most beautiful, most valuable, most holy when we remain true to our complete nature. That theWAY asks us not to refine away our humanity but to find the sacred within it, not despite its imperfections but because of them.
The smoke from my cooking carries up into the evening air, joining the other cooking smells of my Mexican neighborhood - meat and corn and chili and now this sweetness that tastes of wisdom. My nose still runs slightly from the market\'s spices. My fingers are sticky with sugar. My heart is full with the day\'s lesson, taught through humble means: that authenticity needs no improvement, that wisdom often comes unrefined, that some things - like piloncillo, like theWAY itself - are perfect precisely because they remain completely, unapologetically themselves.

## The Divine in Butter and Saffron
The gecko who lives above my fish stall in Puerto Vallarta\'s market has developed discerning taste in humans. I\'ve watched it for months now, how it tilts its head at each customer, somehow knowing which ones carry light in their souls. This morning, its entire body shifted with unusual interest as Darren approached my counter. My own hands were slick with fish scales - that particular iridescence that catches morning light like trapped opals, making even the mundane work of cleaning fish feel like handling pieces of sea-transformed sky.
The morning air carried its familiar symphony - sea-salt and diesel from the fishing boats, the sharp sweetness of mangos from the fruit vendor\'s stall, someone\'s coffee brewing with cinnamon, and everywhere the underlying note of ancient stone warmed by sun. A vendor\'s radio played ranchera music that seemed to make the heat itself dance, while somewhere a rooster, confused by the city\'s endless light, crowed its delayed greeting to dawn.
Darren\'s eyes met those of a particularly handsome corvina I\'d selected in the pre-dawn hours, when the boats came in trailing seabirds and hope. His gaze moved over each fish with rare attention - not just looking but truly seeing. Something in the way his fingers traced the scales reminds me of my old teacher in Kamakura, who taught me that every fish carries its own story in the patterns of its scales, the clarity of its eyes, the tension in its flesh.
\"Do you need advice on cooking it?\" I asked, though something in his hands had already told me the answer. Chef\'s hands - strong enough to command a kitchen, yet sensitive enough to feel a sauce\'s perfect moment of emergence. The kind of hands that know the difference between stirring and folding, between chopping and dicing, between cooking and creating something that transcends mere sustenance.
The gecko above us tilted its head further, drinking in Darren\'s presence like sunshine. When we spoke of rosemary and butter, of saffron\'s mystery, its tongue flicked out as if tasting the possibilities. Here was someone who understood what my fish market teacher had taught me - that cooking is not just about feeding bodies but about creating moments where the ordinary transforms into something sacred through attention and care.
His dinner invitation came as naturally as the tide\'s turning. Their house perches above a community playground where life plays out its daily drama - young men on motorcycles performing ancient courtship rituals with removed mufflers (the more noise, my neighbor explains, the more likely pretty girls will look their way), children discovering the power of their voices echoing off stone walls, mothers walking the eternal circle of nurture. The evening air carries the scent of jasmine from someone\'s balcony garden, mixing with the salt breeze that reminds us the sea is never far away.
Another gecko watches from their kitchen wall, this one with the same tilted wisdom I\'d seen in the market. Their cat, Mimo, performs the ritual dance of feline disdain - touching us with his tail while pretending we don\'t exist, then settling on a windowsill to watch pigeons with professional interest. The kitchen itself feels like a shrine to simple things done well - copper pots hanging like bells, herbs drying in bunches, the smooth wooden handles of well-used knives polished by years of careful work.
Watching Darren cook is like witnessing a meditation. His hands move with the sure grace of someone who has learned that mastery comes not from controlling ingredients but from listening to them. The butter melts into gold, releasing that particular sweet richness that only real butter has. Fresh rosemary releases its pine-scented memories as his fingers strip the leaves from the stem. Saffron threads bloom like sunset in the pan, each one a tiny flame of color and possibility.
The wine we share tastes of green apples and summer grass, its coolness a blessing against the evening heat. We talk of nothing and everything - of how life flows in this city of stone streets and endless music, of the wealth found in simple moments shared. The gecko nods in agreement while Mimo purrs his reluctant blessing from his windowsill throne.
I think of what my teacher once said about finding the divine in ordinary moments. Tonight I understand that truth anew, watching how the simple alchemy of butter, herbs, and friendship transforms my morning\'s fish into something that carries hints of transcendence. We are most ourselves, most holy, when we stop trying to be special and simply allow the sacred to flow through our ordinary acts - through the cleaning of fish, the sharing of wine, the silent blessing of watching herbs and butter transform into something greater than their parts.
*saffron blooms in pan*
*while gecko tastes truth rising \-\--*
*butter speaks through heat*\
\
*(what kitchens teach here:)*
*some prayers need no temple walls*
Even the wrapping of leftovers becomes a kind of ceremony, each morsel treated with respect, because tomorrow\'s lunch will carry the memory of tonight\'s grace. This too is part of theWAY - finding infinite worth in finite moments, letting divinity speak through the humble voices of geckos and cats, fish and friends, butter and saffron.
## When Fear Met Flesh
Evening light slants through my host\'s kitchen window, catching on the blade of my knife as I prepare to demonstrate proper sashimi technique. A house gecko watches from its perch above the sink, its translucent flesh reminding me of perfect tuna belly. Like the fish I\'m about to prepare, it knows something about being seen while seeing, about the intimate dance between observer and observed.
\"I\'ve never eaten raw fish at home,\" Sarah confesses, her fingers nervously tracing patterns on the counter\'s edge. \"Only at restaurants where I can pretend it came from\... somewhere else.\" The others nod in recognition - five friends gathered to learn about sashimi, each carrying their own anxieties about this most direct form of consumption. Through the window, I can see fireflies beginning their evening dance, reminding me that transformation is always possible, that light can emerge from the most unexpected places.
The fish lies before us - a perfect yellowtail, caught just hours ago. My hands move through the ritual of preparation, showing rather than telling how to read its readiness for this most intimate offering. \"See how clear the eyes are?\" I invite them closer. \"How the gills still hold this particular red? The flesh remembers being alive so recently that it can speak directly to our own living flesh.\"
\"But isn\'t that exactly what\'s\... frightening?\" Michael asks, a professor who can lecture for hours about food culture but flinches at the sight of fish skin. \"Eating something so\... immediate?\" The gecko shifts position, perhaps recognizing something about fear and feeding that transcends species. Its own relationship with prey involves no cooking, no disguise - just honest encounter between hunger and sustenance.
My knife parts flesh from bone with practiced precision, revealing the gradients of color and texture that tell us how each cut wants to be received. \"Look here,\" I show them how the flesh maintains its integrity, how each muscle fiber holds its perfect alignment. \"Your body recognizes this organization - cell speaking to cell across the boundaries of separate beings.\"
\"It\'s so\... intimate,\" whispers Elena, both attracted and uncertain. Her hands move unconsciously as if already feeling the texture she still fears to touch. The gecko catches a moth, demonstrating its own understanding of direct consumption. No one flinches at this natural display - somehow the gecko\'s honest hunger seems less threatening than their own---he stops chewing and so honestly watches Elena, with wings sticking out his mouth.
*blade reveals flesh*
*while gecko shows night\'s truth \-\--*
*fear melts between worlds*\
\
*(what bodies know here:)*
*communion needs no mask*
\
Through the evening, I guide them through different cuts, different ways of encountering what will become part of themselves. "This flesh will become your flesh, build muscle, feed your brain. Feel how cool it remains,\" I encourage them to touch, to engage directly with what they\'ve kept at distance. \"Your fingers can read freshness more accurately than any label.\" Slowly, their hands lose their hesitation, remembering what their bodies never forgot about reading what is safe to consume.
\"It\'s the immediacy that matters,\" I explain while slicing perfect pieces of belly meat. \"No transformation through fire, no disguise through heavy seasoning - just direct communion between your living flesh and what offers itself to become part of you.\" The gecko watches with apparent interest, perhaps appreciating this discussion of its own feeding philosophy.
Sarah\'s face shows the particular concentration of someone confronting old fears with new awareness. \"It\'s like\... the difference between reading about someone and meeting them face to face,\" she offers. \"Both are ways of knowing, but one is more\...\" she struggles for the word.
\"Real?\" I suggest, presenting her with the first piece - transparent as sea glass, carrying all the ocean\'s stories in its cells. \"This is food that still remembers being alive, offering itself to become part of your own aliveness.\" Her hands tremble slightly as she takes it, but her eyes show recognition of something her body already understands about direct transmission of energy from being to being.
Through the night, fear slowly transforms into fascination. They learn to read texture with their tongues, to feel how different cuts speak differently to their bodies\' own wisdom about what they need. The gecko continues its own evening hunt, providing unconscious affirmation of how natural it is to consume life directly, without the intermediary of fire or disguise.
\"I never thought about how cooking can be a kind of\... hiding,\" Michael reflects, accepting a piece of tuna that glows rose-red in the fading light. \"How heat and spices can distance us from what we\'re really doing - taking another being into ourselves.\" The gecko catches another moth, as if underlining his point about honest consumption.
Tonight, as they learn to trust their bodies\' ability to read what is safe and good to consume raw, I watch old barriers dissolve between what they think of as food and what they recognize as life offering itself to become part of their own living. The gecko remains our witness, understanding something about how fear melts when we accept our place in the great dance of eating and being eaten.
## When Arrogance make Teachers Invisible
At the fish market this morning I had to stop cleaning for a while, to observe. I watched ants finding their way across my wooden cutting boards, their tiny bodies navigating around drops of fish blood and scales. Their movements carry a wisdom we\'ve forgotten - how to communicate without words, how to work without ego, how to be fully present in each moment\'s task.
Life is full for them, and meaningful. These small teachers demonstrate something we modern humans have lost - the ability to be completely who and what we are, without pretense or performance. They don\'t waste energy trying to be butterflies or attempting to improve their \"productivity metrics.\" They simply are ants, fulfilling their nature with perfect authenticity.
When they find a dead fish scale, they don\'t work alone but signal to others. It is the joy and meaning of the moment for them. Within minutes, seemingly from nowhere they appear. A living chain forms, each member knowing its role without need for management consultants or efficiency experts. Their bodies carry ancient wisdom about cooperation, about community care, about how to balance individual purpose with collective need.
Yet we humans, in our arrogance, see only their industriousness. We reduce their profound teachings about chemical communication, collective intelligence, and social harmony to a simple moral about working harder. Perhaps this says more about our own blindness than about the ants\' wisdom.
*morning ants traverse*
*cutting board\'s sea of fish blood -*
*teachers go unheard*
What lessons might we learn if we truly observed their ways? Not just about work, but about healing, about community, about communication that flows through bodies rather than screens? The ants don\'t need apps to tell them how to live. Their wisdom resides in flesh and chemical trails, in patterns older than our species\' existence.
Instead of just telling people to \"be more productive like ants,\" perhaps we should ask: How have we lost the natural wisdom that even the smallest creatures still carry? What might these tiny beings teach us about being fully present, about living authentically, about finding our place in the great web of existence?
## What Efficiency Cannot See
The Hotel Mariposa installed automatic doors last month. Their chrome and glass surfaces gleam with modern efficiency, sliding open with silent precision that makes Señor Manuel\'s twenty-three years of doorman service seem quaint and outdated. From my fish stall across the street, I watch the subtle changes unfold like ripples spreading from a stone dropped in still water.
This morning, Doña Elena stands confused before those mechanical doors, her arthritis-curved fingers clutching bags from the market. For two decades, Manuel would have seen her coming, would have known to move slightly slower than usual because Thursdays are when her joints trouble her most. The doors slide open with their programmed efficiency, but they cannot recognize how she needs someone to steady her elbow, cannot remember that she likes to pause in the lobby to catch her breath before attempting the stairs.
A gecko watches from above my stall, perhaps noting how the hotel\'s entrance has lost that particular quality of lived-in grace that came from Manuel\'s presence. The mechanical doors cannot tell Señora Rodriguez that her granddaughter left a sweater behind last week, cannot warn Mr. Thompson that the seafood restaurant he\'s heading to has changed owners and no longer serves the fish soup he loves, cannot hold the particular knowledge that comes from years of watching human lives intersect in a specific place.
The young tourists who once lingered in the lobby, absorbing Manuel\'s carefully curated recommendations for authentic local experiences, now clutch their phones instead, reading reviews from strangers who may never have truly known this place. The doors open and close with perfect timing, but they cannot tell you which taxi drivers know the hidden beaches, which cafes make proper Mexican hot chocolate, which streets are best avoided after certain hours.
Near sunset, I watch two women in too-bright makeup and too-short skirts enter unchallenged. Time was when Manuel\'s presence alone would have gently discouraged such traffic, his dignified posture a quiet reminder of the hotel\'s standards. The automatic doors make no such distinctions. They cannot read intention in body language, cannot sense which entries might lead to later disturbances, cannot maintain the delicate social ecosystem that hotels depend upon.
A mouse peers out from beneath my stall, watching the changed patterns of human movement across the street. Even this small creature seems to sense how the hotel\'s rhythm has altered - how the lobby no longer holds that particular quality of welcome that came from being personally received, how the entrance has become merely a point of transit rather than a place of connection.
The hotel manager passes my stall each morning now, his face holding that particular tension of someone slowly recognizing an expensive mistake. The automatic doors have indeed saved money - Manuel\'s salary, his benefits, the small costs of maintaining human presence. But they cannot calculate what\'s been lost - how regular guests have begun staying elsewhere, how the lobby\'s atmosphere has shifted from welcoming to merely functional, how the hotel\'s soul has diminished in ways no spreadsheet can measure.
Last week, an elderly American couple stood before those efficient doors, clearly lost and uncertain. Time was when Manuel would have recognized their confusion, would have appeared at exactly the right moment with exactly the right information delivered in exactly the right way. The doors opened smoothly, precisely, uselessly. The couple turned away, seeking something the machinery couldn\'t provide - the human touch that transforms a building into a home away from home.
The local vendors who once greeted Manuel each morning now hurry past the hotel\'s entrance, no longer pausing to exchange the small courtesies that weave community from individual threads. The automatic doors cannot accept their morning offerings of fresh bread or flowers, cannot pass along news of births and deaths and marriages, cannot maintain the intricate web of relationships that makes a neighborhood more than just a collection of buildings.
A young family arrives with too much luggage, their children overtired from travel. The doors slide open with mechanical perfection, but they cannot tell the parents about the quiet corner of the lobby where generations of children have napped while parents checked in, cannot know which room might be furthest from the morning delivery noise, cannot offer the thousand small kindnesses that Manuel would have known to provide without being asked.
The hotel\'s potted plants have begun to look slightly neglected - not enough to notice unless you knew how Manuel would adjust their positions throughout the day, ensuring each received proper light, maintaining that particular balance between decoration and living things. The automatic doors cannot care for plants, cannot notice when leaves begin to yellow, cannot understand how such small details shape guests\' first impressions.
Tonight, as market closes, I watch the hotel\'s entrance transform from welcoming threshold to mere aperture in a wall. The doors continue their efficient operation, but they cannot hold the accumulated wisdom of decades spent watching over a specific place, cannot maintain the subtle boundaries between public and private space, cannot recognize the difference between entering a building and coming home.
The gecko has moved to watch the hotel\'s changed patterns, perhaps understanding something about how efficiency sometimes costs more than it saves. The mouse returns to its evening rounds, noting how fallen crumbs now accumulate in corners that Manuel would have kept clean. Even these small creatures seem to recognize how human presence carries value that no machine can calculate.

## Wisdom
This morning\'s fish lie gleaming on their bed of ice, their eyes still bright enough to reflect dawn\'s first light. My hands move through their familiar work - testing flesh for freshness, for bruises, checking gills for color, arranging each one just so. These movements, learned through decades of practice, aren\'t knowledge but something deeper. My fingers know truths my mind has never needed to articulate.
Wisdom, I think, is like that. It lives first in the soul-minds before the brain-mind can name it. It\'s what makes my old knife find the perfect angle between fish bones without conscious thought. It\'s what tells me a storm is coming hours before the weather apps send their alerts, written in the particular ache of my joints and the way cats gather in higher places.
Knowledge can be downloaded, copied, transferred like data between machines. The young vendors at my market can memorize fish prices and species names in an afternoon. But wisdom? Wisdom is what grows in layers, like the rings in a tree or the slowly deepening flavors in slow-cooked and properly aged fish sauce. Each experience adds another layer, not just of information but of understanding.
You can study tide tables and memorize fishing schedules - that\'s knowledge. But wisdom is knowing how the sea\'s mood affects the fish\'s taste, how certain winds make the mackerel run deeper, how to read the stories written in the patterns of scales and the texture of flesh. It\'s the difference between knowing the temperature at which water boils and understanding how humidity changes the way dough feels under your fingers.
Wisdom shows itself in what we don\'t do as much as what we do. It\'s the pause before speaking that allows deeper knowing to surface. It\'s knowing when to let a grieving person sit in silence rather than filling the air with empty comfort. It\'s understanding that some fish need to rest after their journey before being cut, that some truths need time to ripen before being harvested.
Perhaps most importantly, wisdom carries a particular humility. The more layers of understanding we acquire, the more clearly we see how much we don\'t know. Like the ocean itself - the deeper you go, the more vast and mysterious it becomes. Knowledge often brings certainty; wisdom teaches us to be comfortable with uncertainty.
I think of my fish market teacher, how she could look at a fish and read its whole journey - where it was caught, how long it had traveled, whether it died in fear or peace. That wasn\'t knowledge she could have downloaded or learned from books. It was wisdom earned through years of attention, through allowing experience to slowly reshape her understanding like water sculpting stone.
Wisdom is what remains after the tide of facts and figures recedes. It\'s what settles in our bones after experience has been digested by time and reflection. It\'s the pattern we begin to see beneath life\'s surface movements, like the deep currents that move beneath the ocean\'s waves.\
\
*fish scales tell tales*
*fingers read what books can\'t teach -*
*wisdom lives in flesh*
\
So perhaps wisdom isn\'t something we can truly define, any more than we can hold the ocean in a cup. We can only point to its traces - in the sureness of practiced hands, in the depth of weathered eyes, in the silence that knows when not to speak. It\'s not the accumulation of facts but the slow transformation of our being through lived experience and careful attention.
In the end, wisdom might be simply this: the capacity to live deeply rather than merely survive, to find meaning in the mundane, to recognize that every moment - even the act of defining wisdom - is both teacher and lesson, if we have learned how to pay attention.
*\Running fingers along a fish\'s spine, feeling the truth that lives beneath words\*
Or perhaps I\'m overthinking it. Perhaps wisdom is just learning to be as honest as a fresh fish on ice - completely itself, hiding nothing, offering its truth to anyone who knows how to read it.
## When Raw Spoke Truth
The morning tuna yields its secrets under my knife - different cuts speaking different truths about how they want to be consumed. The spider pauses in her web-mending to watch me separate akami from chutoro, perhaps recognizing something about how life offers itself in various ways, each perfect for its purpose. The flesh speaks through color, through texture, through the particular way light catches in its grain about how it wants to meet human need.
Its sushi day for some of us, when tour groups and eager learners come to learn, when restaurants and cooking classes play with sashimi.
\"Why can\'t we just cook it all?\" a customer asks, watching me prepare a selection of sashimi. Her question carries that particular anxiety some people feel about raw food, about unmediated encounter with what will become part of their own flesh. My hands continue their careful work, letting the fish demonstrate what my words might fail to explain.
\"See this?\" I show her how the otoro\'s fat marbling catches light like rose quartz. \"Cooking would destroy its essential nature, would transform what wants to be received directly.\" My fingers trace the muscle grain, showing how each slice must be cut perpendicular to these lines to achieve the perfect texture that will melt on the tongue. \"Some cuts ask us to meet them in their pure state, to take their energy into ourselves without intervention.\"
Through my market morning, I guide others through this intimate geography. Here, the lean akami that carries the fish\'s strength, best eaten raw to receive its clean vitality. There, the denser flesh near the bone that benefits from fire\'s transformation. Each part offering itself differently, each asking for specific forms of attention and preparation.
\"But isn\'t raw dangerous?\" Another customer hovers uncertainly over the sashimi selection. My hands show him how to read freshness in translucency, in the particular sheen that speaks of life recently transformed rather than merely ended. \"The real danger,\" I tell him, \"is in not recognizing what each cut asks of us - when to cook, when to cure, when to receive directly what another being offers.\"
A young sushi chef apprentice assigned to me watches how I separate the different cuts, his hands unconsciously mimicking my movements. \"Feel this,\" I invite him, letting him experience how the flesh responds differently to the knife depending on its location in the fish\'s body. \"Each part tells us how it wants to be handled, how it wants to become part of the person who will consume it.\"
*blade finds flesh planes*
*while spider reads morning light \-\--*
*raw truth speaks through grain*\
\
*(what fish teaches here:)*
*some gifts need no change*
The spider above us continues her patient work, consuming her prey without transformation - a direct exchange of energy from one form to another. Like sashimi, some nourishment asks for immediacy, for the courage to meet life directly rather than through the mediation of heat or heavy seasoning.
\"There\'s an intimacy to eating raw fish,\" I explain to a customer who\'s never tried sashimi. \"You taste not just flesh but the ocean it swam in, not just muscle but the energy it carried. Nothing hidden, nothing transformed - just pure encounter between your life and its offering.\" My knife releases another perfect slice, the surface catching light like wet silk. \"Some cuts carry this invitation to direct communion.\"
Through the day, I help others learn this subtle language of flesh and purpose. How the belly meat, rich with fat, asks to be eaten raw so its complex flavors can speak directly to the tongue. How the leaner cuts near the tail tell stories of power and movement that need no interpretation. How some pieces require fire\'s alchemy to become fully accessible, while others would only be diminished by heat\'s transformation.
A priest stops by my stall, watching me prepare sashimi with the same attention he brings to handling sacred vessels. \"Ah,\" he nods, seeing how each cut reveals its own truth about appropriate preparation. \"Like some sutras that must be transmitted directly, while others need interpretation.\" His understanding brings a smile - yes, exactly like that. Some wisdom asks for immediate reception, while other forms require transformation to be fully received.
Tonight, after the market closes, I\'ll clean my boards and knives with the same attention I bring to preparing sashimi. Tomorrow will bring new opportunities to help others understand this intimate art of direct reception - how some nourishment asks us to meet it in its pure state, how some communion requires the courage to encounter life\'s offerings without intervention.
The spider will continue her own practice of direct consumption, understanding something about how energy moves most cleanly when we don\'t impose unnecessary transformation. Some gifts ask only that we receive them as they are, that we have the courage to meet life directly, that we trust in the wisdom of what each being offers in its own perfect way.
## When Simple Held Depth
 The morning\'s first mackerel bleeds onto my cutting board, its life flowing out in patterns that remind me of calligraphy - ancient characters written in fish blood and morning light. A spider mends her web between my ice bins, dealing with night\'s damage the same way I prep my stall each dawn. Neither of us questions whether this daily renewal holds meaning. Our bodies know what minds sometimes forget - that purpose lives in the doing, not the declaring.
\"Don\'t you want to do something more meaningful with your life?\" The question comes from a well-dressed woman buying fish for her daughter\'s wedding feast. Her tone carries that particular concern some people feel when they think they\'ve discovered someone living below their potential. \"You\'re obviously intelligent, observant. Surely there are more significant things you could do than selling fish?\"
My hands continue their work as I consider her question. They move through familiar patterns - testing flesh for freshness, finding the perfect angle for each cut, transforming what was once a living being into food that will nourish others. Every motion carries decades of accumulated wisdom, every decision guided by knowledge that lives in bone and sinew rather than abstract thought.
\"What could be more meaningful,\" I find myself answering, \"than participating in how life feeds life?\" My fingers trace the particular pattern of scales that tells me this fish died well, quickly, without prolonged struggle. \"Every day I help transform beings into nourishment, help people choose food that will sustain their families, participate in the ancient exchange between sea and human need.\"
The spider pauses in her web repair, perhaps sensing something important in this moment. Like her, I weave connections - between fisher and consumer, between sea and city, between the physical reality of death and the continuation of life. My work holds stories written in fish blood and ice melt, in the particular way early light catches on scales, in how human hands learn to read freshness through touch.
\"But you could be writing, teaching, sharing your insights with a wider audience,\" she persists, not seeing how every cut I make, every interaction I have, every moment of attention I bring to my work is already a kind of teaching. Her phone buzzes with notifications, drawing her attention away from the actual miracle happening on my cutting board - life becoming food becoming life again.
*fish blood writes truth*
*while spider mends morning web \-\--*
*meaning flows through hands*\
\
*(what work teaches here:)*
*depth lives in simple things*
Through my market morning, I think about her question. About how meaning doesn\'t need to announce itself with credentials or audiences, doesn\'t need to scale up or broadcast wide to matter. Every moment attended to fully becomes its own kind of sacred text - the way ice melts in patterns that mirror larger truths, how fish eyes hold sky even in death, how human hands remember what minds forget about what matters.
A young apprentice fisherman stops by, troubled by similar questions about significance. \"Sometimes,\" he confesses, \"I wonder if I should have studied business instead.\" His hands, already showing calluses from rope and net, move unconsciously in the patterns his work has taught them. His body knows something his doubting mind hasn\'t yet recognized - about how meaning emerges through relationship with real things, through participation in actual processes of life and death and nourishment.
\"Look here,\" I show him how this morning\'s fish holds stories about water temperature, about ocean currents, about the health of entire ecosystems. \"Every day we read messages written in scales and flesh, participate in exchanges older than our species, help sustain connections between sea and human need. What could be more significant than being fully present to this?\"
The spider continues her patient work above us, each strand of silk a testament to the meaning inherent in necessary things. She doesn\'t question whether her web is significant enough, doesn\'t wonder if she should be spinning larger patterns or catching more attention. Like the fish, like the ice, like the hand that knows exactly how to cut along a spine, she simply does what she is called to do with full attention.
This is what the woman with her concern about significance couldn\'t see - how meaning saturates every moment we attend to fully, how wisdom speaks through blood and bone and mundane miracle. Her phone buzzed with notifications about supposedly larger things, while actual infinity played out on my cutting board in patterns of fish blood and morning light.
Tonight, after the market closes, I\'ll clean my knives and boards with the same attention I bring to cutting fish. Not because anyone will notice, not because it serves some larger purpose, but because this too is part of the text written in everyday actions, in necessary work, in being fully present to what is actually happening rather than what we think should be happening.
Tomorrow will bring new fish, new patterns of blood on wood, new opportunities to read meaning in scales and flesh and human need. The spider will repair her web again, the ice will melt in its own particular way, hands will remember what minds forget about what matters. This is significance enough - this full participation in the actual business of life, this deep attention to what is really happening in each ordinary miracle of morning.
## When Words Found Their Own Way
The morning air carries fish market scents and something else - the particular musty sweetness of old paper as I sort through notebooks in my small apartment. A spider has built her web between my desk lamp and a stack of journals, her delicate architecture catching early light like thoughts made visible. She watches me read my own words from seasons past, perhaps understanding something about how we spin our experiences into forms that might catch passing wisdom.
My fingers find dried fish scales pressed between pages like unexpected bookmarks, each one carrying memories of moments when something needed to be written in the market, even if I wasn\'t sure why or for whom. Through my window, I can hear the market coming alive, reminding me that soon I\'ll need to attend to more practical matters. But for now, my hands rest on words written in early morning hours or late at night, when truth demanded witness despite my uncertainty about having any right to give it voice.
\"Why do you write these things?\" a young vendor asked me recently, catching me making notes about the particular way morning light caught in fish eyes, about how human hands remember what minds forget. \"Who are they for?\" The questions carried no judgment, just genuine curiosity about why someone would spend precious rest hours trying to capture what most people overlook. I had no ready answer then. My fingers kept moving across the page, tracking something that felt necessary without knowing exactly why.
Reading these old entries now, I find myself questioning every third line - too direct here, too personal there, too many details about bodily realities that polite society prefers to ignore. Yet my hands remember the necessity that drove them to record exactly these things - the way fish blood and human grief smell surprisingly similar, how specific joints ache before rain, how wisdom often speaks through the very experiences we\'re taught to keep private.
A fresh breeze through my open window carries market sounds - the particular rhythm of wooden handles meeting cutting boards, the susurration of water over ice, the early morning conversations between vendors setting up their stalls. My current notebook lies open, waiting. Something about the quality of light on drying nets wants to be recorded, but I hesitate. Who am I to speak of such things? What right do I have to suggest that divine truth flows through fish scales and work-roughened hands?
The spider in her web seems to understand something about this - how we spin our forms not because we choose to but because we must, how each thread connects to others in ways we can\'t fully comprehend while weaving. Her work may be destroyed by evening, yet still she spins, following some deeper knowing that transcends questions of permanence or purpose.
*spider weaves dawn light*
*while old notebooks hold fish scales \-\--*
*truth finds its own voice*\
\
*(what words teach here:)*
*wisdom flows through honest sight*
Sometimes readers find me, saying my words helped them see something they already knew but hadn\'t found language for. Like setting out food for strays - I never know who might be fed, only that some offerings need to be made. The spider understands this too, I think - how her web might catch nothing or something, but the weaving itself follows laws older than conscious purpose.
My fingers find another page, this one water-stained from writing too close to fish cleaning. The words carry memories of doubt - about being too direct, too physical, too focused on details others might find uncomfortable. Yet my hands remember the necessity that drove them to record exactly these things, how truth sometimes needs witness especially in its ungraceful moments.
I have no desire to be remembered - what use is remembrance to the remembered? Like the spider\'s web, these words exist as temporary structures that might catch passing light, might offer brief nourishment to a hungry soul, might create connections I\'ll never know about. The tree doesn\'t need to know who sits in its shade or which squirrel might plant its seeds elsewhere.
Perhaps wisdom travels like this - not through grand pronouncements or polished philosophies, but through small honest moments shared without agenda. Through one person saying \"I saw this too\" or \"yes, truth sometimes smells like fish blood and speaks through aching joints.\" Through simple witness to how divinity flows through every aspect of physical existence, even (or especially) the ones we\'re taught to ignore.
My current notebook waits, pages empty but somehow pregnant with possibility. Soon I\'ll need to close it, wash my hands, head to market, attend to the practical work of cleaning fish and making a living. But for now, my fingers hover over paper, feeling the familiar necessity rising - not to create something lasting or important, but simply to witness what passes through this particular moment, this specific angle of light, this unique configuration of life that will never exist quite this way again.
The spider continues her work, weaving connections between desk lamp and papers, between thought and form, between impulse and expression. We are not so different, perhaps - each following our own dharma, spinning temporary structures that might catch passing truth, might offer brief nourishment, might create connections we\'ll never fully understand.
## When Hands Remembered Truth
The workshop smells of freshly planed cypress and aging wood glue, with undertones of something deeper - the particular scent that rises when living tissue meets steel with intention. A praying mantis perches on the windowsill, her alien head turning to track each movement of old Yoshida-san\'s hands as he examines a beam meant for temple restoration. Even in this early light, I can see the flaw he\'s found - a hidden crack that means this piece can\'t be used where it was intended.
\"Just fill it with resin,\" the contractor suggests, his phone already calculating the cost of delay. \"Modern materials are stronger than wood anyway. No one would know.\" The mantis turns to study him with the particular attention her species brings to potential prey. Yoshida-san\'s apprentice shifts uncomfortably, caught between contemporary pressure and traditional knowing.
Through my market-trained eyes, I recognize this moment - the same tension I see in young fishermen tempted to take spawning fish, in craftspeople asked to rush processes that require time. The modern world\'s hunger for shortcuts pressing against wisdom earned through generations of patient attention. My own hands still carry the memory of refusing to sell fish I knew wasn\'t ready, even when profit beckoned.
\"The beam would know,\" Yoshida-san says simply, already reaching for his saw to cut the wood into smaller pieces that can be used elsewhere. \"And so would my hands.\" His movements carry the particular grace of someone whose body has learned truth too deep to ignore. The contractor starts to argue about schedules and budgets, but something in the old craftsman\'s posture silences him. Some boundaries, once grown, cannot be uncrossed without severing something essential in ourselves.
The mantis watches him work, her forelegs folded in what looks remarkably like consideration. She understands something about patience, about waiting for right action rather than rushing to satisfy immediate hunger. Even predators, it seems, carry their own dharma.
A young architect arrives with her tablet, full of designs that could make traditional joinery faster, more profitable. \"Look,\" she says, showing him how chemical adhesives could replace centuries-old woodworking techniques. \"You could triple your output.\" Her words carry the same urgent logic I hear at my fish market - about efficiency, about market realities, about how those who maintain old ways will be left behind.
Yoshida-san listens politely while his hands continue their work, testing wood grain with the sensitivity of a blind man reading braille. \"Each piece of knowledge adds weight to what we can and cannot do,\" he says finally. \"Once you understand how wood lives and moves, how it remembers its life as a tree, you can\'t treat it like dead matter anymore.\" His fingers find a grain pattern that speaks of decades learning to grow around obstacles. \"Some wisdom changes you forever.\"
*mantis reads wood grain*
*while hands remember old truth \-\--*
*wisdom flows through bone*\
\
*(what craft teaches here:)*
*souls grow through choices kept*
Through the morning, I watch different versions of this dialogue unfold. A client wants freshly cut wood used immediately, unwilling to wait for proper seasoning. A developer offers premium prices for rushed work that needs more time. Each temptation met with the same quiet certainty - not rigid rules, but the natural resistance of a body that has learned its own truth too deeply to ignore.
\"But if you don\'t take these contracts, someone else will,\" the contractor argues one last time. \"Someone who doesn\'t care about doing it the old way.\" The mantis turns to study him again, her alien face somehow managing to convey judgment. If she were twice her size, I'm sure she would slap him. Yoshida-san continues his patient work of transforming flawed beams into smaller pieces of perfect integrity. \"Perhaps,\" he acknowledges, \"but I have to live with my own hands and my heart.\"
This is what modern efficiency experts can never understand - how knowledge brings responsibility, how each piece of wisdom adds another layer to what we can and cannot do while remaining whole. Their calculations leave no room for dharma, no space for the sacred boundaries that grow from relationship rather than regulation, unwittingly or willingly making karma.
Even the mantis seems to understand, cleaning her forelegs with the same attention Yoshida-san brings to maintaining his tools. Some truths transcend species - about patience, about integrity, about how right action flows from right relationship rather than external rules.
Tonight, after the workshops and markets close, our hands will remember what they\'ve learned - his from decades of reading wood grain, mine from years of knowing fish flesh, both carrying wisdom that can\'t be ignored without cost to soul. Tomorrow will bring new pressures, new temptations to compromise what we\'ve learned. But true wealth, perhaps, lies not in what we could gain by forgetting, but in what we keep by remembering.
## When Dharma Spoke Louder Than Profit
The morning air carries more than just salt and diesel - it holds tension today, as thick as the mist rolling off the harbor. Through my market window, I watch young Matsuda-san argue with his father near their boat. \"If we don\'t take them, the big trawlers will,\" his voice rises with frustration. \"At least we\'d use them properly, honor them properly.\" The spider in her web between my drying racks goes still, as if sensing how some choices vibrate through more than just human worlds.
His father\'s response comes quiet but firm as tide: \"Then let others carry that karma. We must live with our own souls.\" The older man\'s hands continue their work of mending nets, each knot tied with the particular attention that speaks of meditation rather than mere repair. His son shifts restlessly, caught between inherited wisdom and modern pressure, between dharma and pragmatism.
The argument isn\'t new. I\'ve heard versions of it all my life - about the spawning grounds we could raid before others do, about the undersized fish we could take before they\'re scooped up by factory ships, about how economic reality doesn\'t leave room for ancient courtesy toward the sea. Always the same reasoning: if we don\'t take more than we should, someone else will.
\"Your grandfather used to say,\" old Tanaka-san joins the conversation, his hands moving through his morning net-checking ritual, \"that dharma isn\'t about what others might do - it\'s about what you can\'t do and still remain whole.\" His fingers find a broken strand, but rather than continuing his work, he lets the net rest in his lap. \"Once you know better, you can\'t un-know it. Each piece of wisdom adds another layer to your dharma.\"
I remember the first time I understood this truth. My teacher had shown me how to read a fish\'s freshness in its eyes, how to know which ones were ready to become food and which ones needed more time in ice. Later, a customer offered extra money for fish I knew wasn\'t ready. \"But if you don\'t sell it to me, someone else will,\" she argued. Yet my hands refused to wrap that fish, my body remembering something my profit-minded brain tried to ignore. Some knowledge, once gained, becomes part of your skeleton.
A young apprentice fisherman pauses near my stall, drawn into the harbor discussion. Yesterday, he spotted a rich fishing ground where tuna were spawning. \"The commercial boats will just take them all anyway,\" he says, the words carrying more question than certainty. \"At least we\'d say the proper prayers, treat them with respect.\"
\"Respect isn\'t just about how you take,\" Matsuda\'s father responds, \"but about knowing when not to take at all.\" His weathered hands ghost through the motion of casting nets, but don\'t actually reach for his gear. \"Each time we learn something deeper about the sea, it adds another threshold we can\'t uncross. That\'s dharma - not rules imposed from outside, but bones grown from within.\"
The spider in her web catches a small fish fly but releases it - something in its struggle perhaps speaking to her own inner knowing about what can and cannot be done today. Even predators, it seems, carry their own dharma, their own innate understanding of right relationship.
*torn nets hold questions*
*while spider frees struggling prey \-\--*
*dharma speaks through bone*\
\
*(what souls learn here:)*
*truth flows through choices kept*
Through my market morning, I watch the struggle play out in younger faces - the tension between knowing better and wanting to survive in a world that rarely rewards restraint. A small mackerel catches light in my ice display, its eye still holding the particular clarity that speaks of recent life. My hands know exactly how to fillet it for maximum profit, but they also carry the wisdom of when such profit carries too high a cost to spirit.
\"But the big companies don\'t care,\" Matsuda-san makes one last attempt, his voice carrying the particular pain of someone fighting their own deeper knowing. \"They\'ll take everything if we don\'t take our share.\" His father simply continues mending his nets, each knot a kind of prayer. The silence stretches between them until the younger man\'s shoulders finally drop, his body remembering what his anxious mind tried to forget - that some lines, once seen, cannot be uncrossed without leaving part of yourself behind.
This is what the industrial fishing operations can never understand - how knowledge brings responsibility, how each piece of wisdom adds another layer to what we can and cannot do with our own souls intact. Their profit calculations leave no room for dharma, no space for the sacred boundaries that grow from relationship rather than regulation.
As evening approaches, I watch Matsuda-san and his father prepare their boat - but not for fishing. Today they\'ll patrol the spawning grounds, standing witness against those who haven\'t yet learned or have chosen to forget. The spider in her web has moved to higher ground, leaving clear the space where young fish leap in their practice jumps. Some wisdom, it seems, transcends species.
Tonight, after the market closes, I\'ll clean my knives with the same attention I use to cut fish - not because anyone would know if I didn\'t, but because my hands have learned their own dharma through years of relationship with scales and flesh and bone. Tomorrow will bring new temptations, new justifications for taking more than we should. But true wealth, perhaps, lies not in what we could take, but in what we choose to preserve - both in the sea and in our souls.
## When Guts Spoke Truth
The morning\'s first sea bream lies before me, its scales catching dawn light like scattered stars. My hands know this next dance by heart - the precise angle needed to open the belly without piercing what lies within. A spider watches from her web between my ice bins, perhaps recognizing something familiar in how carefully I navigate around vital organs, how respectfully I handle what others might consider mere waste.
The first cut releases that particular scent that rises when interior meets exterior - not the unpleasant smell others wrinkle their noses at, but the honest breath of what usually remains hidden. My blade moves with the same delicate attention a surgeon might use, seeking the space just beside the green-gold sac of bile. One wrong move would release bitterness that would taint everything, teaching us how some boundaries must be respected, how some separations serve necessary purpose.
As I ease out the intestinal tract, it comes as a single perfect package - a universe contained in miniature. Here in my hands writhes an ecosystem of microscopic life, billions of beings living and dying and transforming each other in endless cycles of becoming. The same divine energy that spins galaxies moves through these tiny organisms, speaking through their cellular wisdom about how to extract nutrition, how to maintain balance, how to participate in the great dance of consumption and creation.
\"Just guts,\" a young apprentice says, watching me examine what he\'s been taught to consider waste. But my market-trained eyes see deeper - how the particular fullness of the stomach tells stories about plankton blooms and ocean currents, how the color of liver speaks of water quality and season, how even parasites carry messages about the health of entire food chains. Each internal organ a testimony to how energy flows through all things, taking different forms but never truly separated.
My fingers find the tiny sparks of roe hiding beneath other organs - future lives held in perfect suspension, each egg carrying complete instructions for becoming. Not so different, really, from the bacteria teeming in the intestinal tract, or the cells in my own hands that know exactly how to grip a knife, or the spider attending to her web with ancient genetic wisdom. All of us reading from the same profound script written in the language of shared energy.
*blade parts fish flesh*
*while gut holds universe whole \-\--*
*one life flows through all*\
\
*(what viscera teach:)*
*truth lives in hidden places*
\
Through my morning\'s work, I think about how these same processes move through my own body - the countless organisms that make digestion possible, that maintain my skin\'s barrier, that help me think and feel and exist. We humans like to imagine ourselves as singular beings, but we are walking universes, sharing our existence with billions of smaller lives that make our larger life possible. My hands remember this truth that minds often forget - how we are all composed of the same cosmic energy, taking different forms but never truly separate.
A customer asks me to clean her fish quickly, to hurry through this \"unpleasant\" part. But my hands refuse to rush, knowing how one moment\'s impatience could rupture the bile sac, could disrespect the delicate engineering that allows one life to become another\'s nourishment. \"Watch,\" I tell her instead, showing how the organs come away together when handled with proper attention, how even in death this being maintains its perfect internal organization.
The spider in her web has caught a fly, and I watch her wrap it with the same careful attention I bring to my work. She too participates in this great transformation of life into life, this endless cycle of energy taking new forms. Her digestive processes will break down the fly\'s body just as the bacteria in my gut will transform this fish\'s flesh into my own sustenance. Different scales of the same eternal dance.
\"See here,\" I show my young apprentice, pointing to the iridescent shimmer of the peritoneum, the membrane that keeps everything in its proper place. \"Even hidden things can hold beauty if we look with proper attention.\" Like the biofilm that form on rocks, like the bacterial colonies in healthy soil, like the invisible organisms that keep our own bodies functioning - beauty and order exist at every scale, testimony to how divine energy expresses itself through all forms of life.
Tonight, after the market closes, I\'ll clean my boards with the same attention I bring to cleaning fish. The bacteria that help break down the blood and oils are my unseen colleagues in this work, transforming what seems like waste into new forms of life. Tomorrow will bring new fish, new hidden universes to handle with care, new opportunities to witness how the same source energy flows through all things - from the smallest microbe to the largest whale, from the simplest cellular organism to the complex ecology of human consciousness.
## When Youth Was Meant for Foolishness
This morning at the fish market, I watched a child lick an ice chip from my display, her mother distracted by phone notifications. The girl\'s face showed that particular delight that comes from mild disobedience combined with discovery - how ice from a fish market tastes different from ice at home, how the salt and scale essence creates a new kind of cold on her tongue. Her body held no hesitation, no calculation of bacterial counts or social propriety. Just pure presence in the moment of tasting.
The elderly woman who sells seaweed next to me clicked her tongue in disapproval, her aged hands automatically moving to stop this unhygienic exploration. But something made her pause. \"I used to eat snow that fell on cow pats,\" she confided, her wrinkled face softening with memory. \"My grandmother would scold me, but my body needed to know what the world tasted like.\"
Through my stall window, I can see children playing in the plaza - transforming a simple cardboard box into a spaceship, a castle, a submarine. Their bodies move with that particular freedom that comes before self-consciousness calcifies our gestures. A girl wearing a plastic crown bestows imaginary blessings on pigeons, her face holding the perfect seriousness of play. Her older sister, already bent by middle school pressures, watches with embarrassment while pretending to do homework on her tablet.
The spider who lives in the corner of my stall catches light on her web like caught wisdom. She doesn\'t question her instincts, doesn\'t second-guess the ancient knowledge that moves through her legs as she spins. Young spiders spin the same perfect geometry as their elders - their bodies carrying wisdom they\'re not yet aware of, letting it flow through them without the burden of conscious knowledge.
Time was when we understood that youth was meant for a certain kind of holy foolishness. My fish market teacher spoke of how young salmon must leap into bears\' mouths, how baby birds must fall from nests, how children must taste dirt and trust strangers and believe in magic. \"Some wisdom only comes through foolishness,\" she would say, her aged hands moving with the precision of decades cleaning fish. \"Try to be too wise too young, and you\'ll never learn anything new.\"
Last week, a young mother brought her four-year-old to my stall - a solemn child with old eyes who could already read nutrition labels and calculate omega-3 percentages. \"She\'s an old soul,\" the mother said proudly, showing me videos of the girl leading meditation sessions at school. But I noticed how the child\'s body held itself too carefully, how she never ran or jumped or made silly faces. Her wisdom sat on her small shoulders like a weight, keeping her from the necessary foolishness of childhood.
The market\'s cats know better. I watch them teach their kittens through play - pouncing on shadows, attacking their own tails, trusting their bodies to learn what their minds aren\'t ready to know. Even the eldest, wisest cat will sometimes spin in moonlight, remembering how wisdom grows not just through careful observation but through holy foolishness, through the courage to be wrong, to look silly, to taste life without counting the cost.
*young girl tastes ice*
*while wisdom waits patient in*
*her foolish delight*\
\
*(what time teaches here:)*
*some truth needs years to ripen*
Tonight, after the market closes, I\'ll watch the plaza empty of playing children. Their cardboard box will be just a box again, the plastic crown just plastic. But something of their magic will linger - in the pigeons that move differently after being blessed, in the air that holds echoes of untamed laughter, in the space they created for wisdom to grow through glorious foolishness.
Perhaps this is why our deepest knowing often waits for age to reveal itself - not because we\'re incapable of wisdom in youth, but because we need those years of holy foolishness, of tasting ice and blessing pigeons, of trusting wrong people and climbing too high and loving too easily. Our bodies must learn through doing before our minds can learn through knowing.
The elderly seaweed seller still remembers the taste of snow on cow pats. Her body holds both the wisdom of age and the holy foolishness of youth, neither canceling the other but both needed for the full cycle of understanding. Sometimes I catch her making faces at babies when she thinks no one is watching, her aged face lighting with that same pure delight I saw in the ice-tasting child.
Some layers of wisdom can only grow through time, through the slow accretion of experience like fish scales building one upon another. To access it too early would be like opening a chrysalis before its time - the butterfly might be perfectly formed, but it needs that struggle through foolishness to strengthen its wings for flight.
## When The Sea Asked For Help
The morning air carries salt and diesel exhaust, mingling with the particular scent that rises when large marine mammals surface to breathe. Through the pre-dawn mist, I watch old Tanaka-san\'s boat idle at the harbor mouth, his engine\'s deep thrum barely audible over the sound of waves meeting shore. A spider has built her web between the radio antenna and a storage box, her delicate construct catching both sea spray and early light. Like the fishermen, she reads messages in the water\'s breath that no meteorological instrument can detect.
\"The big ones know,\" Tanaka-san tells me later, his hands still damp from helping untangle a young seal from abandoned netting. \"They can tell difference between those who take with respect and those who just take.\" His fingers, rough from decades of handling ropes and fish, move with surprising gentleness as he describes how the seal waited patiently while they worked, its dark eyes holding neither fear nor resignation but something deeper - a knowledge of relationship that transcends the simple categories of predator and prey.
The younger fishermen, with their sonar displays and GPS plotters, sometimes mock these old ways of knowing. They don\'t understand how a whale can recognize help-giving hands, how creatures we hunt can still trust us in their moments of need. But this morning, as if to underscore nature\'s paradoxical wisdom, a massive shadow approaches Yamamoto-san\'s boat. The water breaks and a whale shark emerges, its spotted flank bearing witness to human carelessness - a length of synthetic net wrapped around its gills, cheap plastic floats bob obscenely against its ancient skin.
\"See how she comes to port side?\" Yamamoto-san\'s voice carries across the water. \"She\'s showing us where she needs help.\" His grandson reaches for his phone to record the encounter, but the old fisherman waves him back. \"Some things aren\'t for proving to others,\" he says. \"They\'re for remembering in your bones.\" Their hands move carefully around the creature\'s bulk, reading the tension in net and muscle, understanding which strands to cut first. The whale shark waits with the particular patience of beings who measure time in centuries rather than minutes.
Modern trawlers harvest these waters too, their massive nets indiscriminately scooping up everything in their path. But they never experience this - this moment of communion between hunter and hunted, this sacred trust that transcends the simple mathematics of consumption. Their mechanized efficiency leaves no space for relationship, no room for the complex dance of taking and giving that has governed human interaction with the sea since we first cast lines into her depths.
The net finally falls away, its cheap synthetic strands a stark contrast to the whale shark\'s living tissue. The creature lingers for a moment, its eye (dark as deep water, wise as tide pools) seeming to hold Yamamoto-san\'s gaze. Then, in a movement that transforms tons of flesh into liquid grace, it dips beneath the surface. Fifty meters out, its tail rises - not the random breach of a creature swimming free, but a deliberate gesture, a acknowledgment of debt and gratitude that makes my throat tight with unexpected emotion.
\"The young ones don\'t believe these stories,\" Tanaka-san says later, watching his grandson post shaky video evidence online. \"They need proof for everything. But the sea knows her own - knows who takes what\'s needed with respect, knows who gives back when asked.\" His hands move automatically to mend his nets, their motions carrying the muscle memory of generations who understood that fishing was never just about taking.
Through my market stall window, I can see the massive processing ships anchored on the horizon - floating factories that transform living seas into frozen product. They carry all the latest technology for finding and harvesting fish, but they\'ll never experience what I witnessed this morning. Their crews will never feel the profound humility of being asked for help by creatures they hunt, never know the sacred trust that can exist between predator and prey when both recognize their place in the greater web of life.
A humpback whale surfaces in the bay, its breath carrying across the water like a question. The spider in her web goes still, sensing vibrations too subtle for human perception. The old fishermen pause in their work, reading messages in the whale\'s movement that speak of barnacle trouble, of skin irritation, of trust in human hands that have proven themselves worthy of relationship.
*whale shark brings net*
*while spider reads dawn\'s promise \-\--*
*sea remembers help*\
\
*(what waters teach here:)*
*trust flows through honest taking*
Tonight, after the market closes, I\'ll think about how the ocean offers these paradoxical lessons - how beings we hunt can still trust us, how taking with respect creates space for giving, how relationship transcends the simple categories of friend and food. The spider will continue her patient work, weaving connections between metal and air just as the fishermen weave connection between human need and ocean\'s abundance. Tomorrow, more creatures may approach these weathered boats, asking help from the very hands that also take their kind for food.
This is what the industrial fishing fleets can never understand - that true relationship with the sea requires both giving and taking, both hunting and healing. Their efficient extraction leaves no room for these sacred paradoxes, these moments when the boundaries between hunter and helper dissolve into something deeper than either.
The whale\'s tail wave remains etched in my memory like a benediction, a reminder that some wisdom can only come through maintaining these complex covenants with the beings that share our world. Perhaps this is what we\'re really losing as traditional fishing fades - not just sustainable practices or local knowledge, but the very ability to be in profound relationship with the creatures whose lives intersect with ours, whose deaths feed us, and whose trust humbles us with its unfathomable grace.
## When Aversion Turned to Awe
The morning\'s tuna lies massive on my cutting board, its eye still holding dawn in its curved surface. A young mother shields her child\'s face from what she calls \"the unpleasant part,\" but the little one peeks through fingers with that particular curiosity children have before they\'re taught what to avoid. A spider tends her web above my stall, unbothered by the morning\'s work below - she too knows something about transformation, about how life feeds life without need for our human categories of pleasant and unpleasant.
\"Look,\" I tell the child, who has crept closer despite her mother\'s protests. \"See how the gills are still this perfect red?\" My fingers trace the intricate patterns, delicate as any flower petal. \"Each tiny filament once filtered oxygen from the sea, each one a miracle of engineering.\" The girl\'s eyes widen, seeing beauty where she\'d been taught to expect disgust. Her mother\'s resistance softens slightly, something in her own body remembering wisdom it held before culture taught it what to reject.
Through my market morning, I watch this dance repeat - how people approach and retreat from what is real, how they struggle between fascination and the learned response to turn away. A businessman, pristine in his suit, asks me to wrap his fish quickly, to hide the evidence of what it once was. \"But then you\'ll miss the best part,\" I tell him, showing how the cut surface shimmers with fat marbling, how the spine creates patterns perfect as temple architecture, how even the blood carries messages about strength and health.
\"It\'s just so\... raw,\" a young woman says, watching me work. The word catches in her throat - not just about the fish but about something deeper, some resistance to life\'s fundamental nature. My hands continue their careful dance of transformation, showing rather than telling how every stage carries its own beauty. \"See how the flesh parts perfectly here?\" I guide her attention to the natural seams where muscle meets muscle. \"The body tells us exactly how it wants to be handled, if we learn to listen.\"
An elderly man brings his grandson, specifically asking me to show the boy what he calls \"real things.\" The child\'s hands hover uncertainly over the fish\'s surface, caught between attraction and learned aversion. \"Go ahead,\" I encourage him. \"Feel how the scales all point one way.\" His small fingers discover what his eyes couldn\'t tell him - how each scale fits perfectly with its neighbors, how the skin remains cool despite the morning warmth, how life leaves traces we can only understand through touch.
*child touches fish scales*
*while spider reads morning\'s truth \-\--*
*aversion melts here*\
\
*(what flesh teaches now:)*
*beauty flows through honest sight*
\
The spider above us catches a moth, beginning her own work of transformation. A customer starts to brush away the web, but I stop her. \"Watch,\" I suggest instead. \"See how perfectly she wraps her food, how nothing is wasted, how every movement serves life\'s continuation.\" The woman\'s disgust slowly shifts to fascination as she recognizes something fundamental about how energy moves from form to form, how even death feeds life\'s endless dance.
A young chef, trained in sterile kitchens, flinches at the sound of my knife meeting bone. \"That\'s why we buy it pre-cleaned,\" he explains, hand covering his nose against imagined offense. But his eyes keep returning to my work, something in him recognizing that his craft is incomplete without this understanding. \"Here,\" I show him how the joint articulates, how the membrane holds everything in perfect relation, how even the organs he\'d rather not acknowledge carry their own kind of grace.
\"It\'s all so\... messy,\" a girl comments, watching me clean a particularly large fish. \"Life is messy,\" I agree, showing her how the seemingly chaotic spill of intestines actually follows perfect natural organization. \"But look - see how everything has its place? How even what we think of as disorder carries its own perfect order?\" Her fingers reach out unconsciously, drawn to touch what she\'s discovering she doesn\'t need to fear.
Through the day, I watch resistance soften into recognition, aversion melt into appreciation. The spider continues her work above us, transforming caught insects into sustenance with the same attention I bring to transforming fish into food. Neither of us needs to disguise what we do, to hide the fundamental nature of life\'s necessary exchanges.
Tonight, after the market closes, I\'ll clean my boards and knives with the same openness I bring to cleaning fish. The blood and scales tell their own stories about transformation, about how life moves between forms without need for our human categories of acceptable and unacceptable. Tomorrow will bring new opportunities to help others bridge the gap between what they\'ve been taught to avoid and what their bodies remember about life\'s fundamental beauty.
## When Wood Spoke Truth
The workshop smells of fresh sawdust and aging wood, each species contributing its own note to the symphony of scents - cedar\'s sharp clarity, cherry\'s subtle sweetness, ancient zelkova releasing memories of forests long gone. My nose runs from the fine particles floating in morning light, my body\'s small recognition of how many trees are sharing their breath here. In the corner, a house spider tends her web, catching dust and stories in equal measure. She\'s been here longer than the current craftsmen, her ancestors witnessing generations of humans learning to listen to wood\'s wisdom.
Nakamura-san\'s hands move across a plank of cedar with the same attention one might use to read braille. His fingers find the story written in grain patterns - here a year of drought left growth rings tight and dense, there a warm spring caused exuberant expansion. \"Wood remembers everything,\" he tells me, nose inches from the surface. \"The direction of prevailing winds, the slope of the mountain where it grew, even the earthquakes that made it grow stronger to survive. Our job is not to impose our will, but to reveal what the tree has to teach us.\"
The wood shavings beneath his planer curl like waves, each one carrying the particular memory of the moment blade met fiber. These too will be gathered and saved - some for smoking fish, others for temple incense, none wasted. Even sawdust has its purposes, its own way of continuing the tree\'s story. A young apprentice reaches for industrial sandpaper, but Nakamura-san stops him. \"First learn what the wood wants,\" he says. \"Sometimes what we see as flaws are actually the tree\'s way of showing us its strength.\"
Modern clients often come wanting perfect uniformity, the kind of flawless surfaces that mass production promises. They leave understanding something deeper about beauty. Today, I watch Nakamura-san incorporate a knot into a table design rather than cutting around it, allowing the tree\'s response to ancient injury to become part of its present grace. \"In the old days,\" he tells me, \"people understood that everything carries scars. The question is not how to erase them, but how to make them part of the story.\"
Through the workshop\'s open doors, I can see the covered space where wood seasons. Unlike kiln-dried lumber from factories, these pieces are given time to find their own way of being. \"Wood is still alive,\" Yamamoto-san explains, touching a beam that will one day become part of a temple restoration. \"It moves with the moon, with humidity, with the memories it carries in its cells. Rush this relationship and the wood will never truly settle - it will always be fighting to return to its natural rhythms.\"
The spider in her corner seems to agree, her web vibrating with some subtle resonance I can\'t quite identify. Perhaps she feels how the wood around her shifts microscopically with temperature changes, with barometric pressure, with the endless dance of moisture moving through fibers that remember being alive. The craftsmen treat her with the same respect they show their materials - another being doing her work according to ancient patterns.
Our bodies know things our minds have forgotten. I watch a young woodworker\'s hands hesitate over chemically treated lumber, his fingers registering something his conscious mind might deny. \"The wood feels wrong,\" he says, struggling to explain. \"Like it\'s been silenced.\" Nakamura-san nods in understanding. When we surround ourselves with materials that have been processed into submission, we lose something essential - the living dialogue between species, the quiet conversation between fiber and flesh.
\"People think they\'re allergic to wood dust,\" Yamamoto-san tells me, cleaning his glasses with a cloth worn silk-smooth by years in his pocket. \"But often they\'re really reacting to the chemicals used to process it, to preserve it, to bend it to human will.\" He shows me the difference between sawdust from fresh-cut local maple and the engineered wood products that fill modern homes. One smells of life and seasons, the other carries sharp notes of something manufactured, something that makes my throat constrict in warning.
The workshop has adapted to modern needs - there\'s a CNC machine in one corner for certain types of precision cuts, digital measuring tools that ensure client specifications are met. But these are seen as assistants rather than replacements, ways to handle the mundane so human hands can focus on the aspects of woodworking that machines can\'t replicate - the ability to read grain and tension, to feel how a piece wants to be shaped, to engage in the intimate dialogue between human and tree that produces true beauty.
A client arrives with a handful of bark-beetle damaged wood, asking if it can be saved. Rather than dismissing it as flawed, Nakamura-san studies the intricate patterns left by the insects\' tunneling. \"Look,\" he says, \"they\'ve already started the design for us.\" His hands move across the surface, feeling how the wood responded to invasion by growing stronger around the damage. \"This is how nature works - finding beauty in challenge, strength in adaptation. Why should we do differently?\"
The spider pauses in her web-mending to watch us pass beneath her domain. She\'s learned the workshop\'s rhythms - which machines cause vibrations to avoid, which corners remain undisturbed, how to integrate the daily movement of humans and wood into her own patterns of survival. Like the craftsmen below her, she understands something about working with natural forces rather than against them.
As afternoon light slants through sawdust-softened air, I watch Nakamura-san teach an apprentice to plane by hand. \"Listen,\" he says, adjusting the angle of attack. \"The wood will tell you which way it wants to be worked.\" The young man\'s movements are too aggressive at first, shaped by a world that values speed over understanding. But gradually, his strokes smooth out, find their rhythm, begin to flow with rather than against the grain. His body remembers something his modern education never taught him - how to enter into conversation with another species\' way of being.
A stack of plastic-wrapped lumber delivery sits outside, waiting to be used for utility projects. Even here, modern materials have their place. But for anything meant to last, anything meant to carry beauty forward in time, the craftsmen reach for wood that has been allowed to retain its voice. \"Engineered products are like processed food,\" Yamamoto-san explains. \"They fill space, they serve function, but they don\'t feed the deeper hunger - for connection, for relationship, for things that carry real energy.\"
*blade meets ancient grain*
*while spider reads workshop\'s pulse \-\--*
*wood remembers all*\
\
*(what trees whisper here:)*
*life flows through honest scars*
Tonight, after the workshop closes, the wood will continue its subtle movement - expanding, contracting, releasing scent molecules that have been locked in cells for decades or centuries. The spider will continue her patient work, weaving connections between beams that once stood as trees in different forests. Tomorrow, human hands will again enter this ancient dialogue, finding new ways to let beauty emerge from the conversation between what was and what is becoming.
This is what the modern world too often forgets - that we are meant to live in relationship with materials that remember being alive, that carry energy patterns our bodies recognize at a level deeper than consciousness. When we surround ourselves with synthetic materials, we starve some essential part of our being - the part that knows how to read the wisdom in wood grain, that understands the language of fiber and season, that recognizes truth in the particular way afternoon light catches dust motes dancing in air that smells of cedar and time.
## When Paper Held Memory
The mulberry bark strips soak in steel vats now, their transformation monitored by digital thermometers, but the smell remains unchanged - vegetal and sharp, carrying hints of early spring when the branches were harvested. My nose runs from the steam rising into the cold morning air, my body\'s small revolt against the caustic preparation that turns tough bark into delicate fiber. The old papermakers say this reaction is necessary - if the chemicals don\'t make you weep, they\'re not strong enough to break down the bark\'s resistance.
Tanaka-san\'s hands move through the vat with practiced certainty, testing the fibers\' readiness by feel rather than timer. Her fingers are stained permanently tan from decades of this work, the chemicals having written their own story into her skin. \"People think paper is dying,\" she says, stirring the fragments that will soon become something both fragile and strong. \"But paper remembers what screens forget - the weight of thought, the texture of time, the particular way light catches on depth rather than surface.\"
The workshop itself seems caught between ages. Fluorescent lights illuminate ancient wooden frames, their surfaces polished by generations of wet hands. A computer monitors pH levels in the vat where natural fibers are prepared, but the rhythmic motion of screen-shaking remains entirely human, guided by muscle memory that no machine has successfully replicated. Even the youngest workers here learn first through their bodies - how pulp flows, how fiber aligns, how each sheet forms itself according to laws older than our understanding of chemistry.
\"Watch this,\" Tanaka-san calls me closer, lifting a newly-formed sheet. Light passes through it like morning sun through spring leaves, revealing subtle patterns where fibers have found their own way of settling together. \"Every sheet is different, like fingerprints or snowflakes. The paper remembers every current in the water, every movement of the screen, every particle of dust that became part of its being. Try getting a PDF to do that.\"
Modern clients want consistency, uniformity, predictable behavior in their paper. The workshop has adapted - there are now machines that can produce hundred of identical sheets per hour. But these are not the papers that conservation museums request for restoring ancient scrolls, not the papers that artists seek for works meant to outlast their creators. For these, they still come to the handmade, the imperfect, the sheets that carry wisdom in their very fiber.
In the corner, a young apprentice struggles with a particularly fine grade of paper meant for repairing ancient Buddhist texts. Her movements are too hurried, too mechanical, too shaped by a world that values speed over attention. \"Slower,\" Yamamoto-san guides her, his own movements matching the natural settling rate of fiber in water. \"Listen to what the pulp wants to become.\" The girl\'s phone buzzes in her pocket, but here, in this moment of creation, time moves according to older rhythms.
The afternoon light slants through windows clouded by decades of paper dust, catching on floating fibers that dance like snow in subtle air currents. This same dust once coated the lungs of papermakers, but modern ventilation systems now protect human breath while maintaining the crucial humidity that paper-making requires. The old ways persist where they serve truth, adapt where they must, each generation adding its own solutions to ancient challenges.
I watch Tanaka-san test paper thickness the traditional way - holding sheets up to light while her assistant uses a digital micrometer. Both methods have their place now. \"The machine tells you the numbers,\" she explains, \"but your eyes tell you the truth.\" Her fingers move across the surface, reading qualities no instrument can measure - how the fibers have bonded, how the sheet will accept ink, how it will age through decades or centuries of holding human thought.
The workshop recently began making custom papers for digital art printing - archival qualities combined with surfaces that can accept modern inks. \"Paper adapts,\" Yamamoto-san tells me, testing a new formation. \"It adapted from bamboo to mulberry, from religious texts to love letters, from accounting books to art. Why not from brush to printer?\" Yet even these modern papers are made with ancient wisdom - understanding how fiber flows, how sheets dry, how surface texture affects the way light and color play across depth rather than merely hitting a screen.
A young designer arrives with her laptop, full of ideas for sustainable packaging to replace plastic. The old papermakers listen patiently to her plans for uniform production, then show her how natural variations in handmade paper actually make it stronger, more adaptable, more alive. \"Look here,\" Tanaka-san holds a sheet up to light. \"See how the fibers create their own patterns of strength? Nature already solved the problems we\'re still trying to figure out.\"
*wet fibers settle* ****
*while machines measure what hands*
*already know - time flows*\
\
*(what paper teaches:)*
*strength flows through imperfect bonds*
Tonight, after the workshop closes, the newly-made papers will continue their transformation - drying, settling, fibers finding their final alignment in darkness. The mulberry bark will soak in its caustic bath, surrendering its original form to become something new yet carrying memory of tree, of sun, of seasons in every fiber. Tomorrow, human hands will again enter this ancient alchemy, finding new ways to let beauty emerge from the dialogue between what was and what is becoming.
Perhaps this is what survival looks like - not pristine preservation but living adaptation, each generation adding its own wisdom to ancient knowledge. The paper remembers everything - the tree that gave its bark, the hands that transformed it, the particular quality of light and air on the day of its making. Even our modern adaptations become part of this continuing story, written not in ink but in the very substance of creation.
Would you like me to explore another aspect of traditional crafts finding their way in the modern world? Perhaps the way traditional dyeing arts adapt to environmental consciousness, or how wood crafts find new relevance in an age of mass production?
## The Mathematics of Freedom
The American tourists who pass Manuel and Paula\'s house always walk a little faster, their faces carrying that particular expression of people congratulating themselves on being born in better circumstances. They see the small concrete home with its weathered paint, the old cars parked outside that would never pass inspection in their countries, the plastic chairs in the front yard that have been mended rather than replaced. Their phones come out to capture evidence of \"local poverty\" for social media posts about being grateful for their \"first world\" blessings.
What they don\'t see is Manuel in the early morning, drinking coffee and calculating numbers in a worn notebook - not bills and debts, but the steady accumulation of rental income from the two apartments he and Paula own outright in town. His pencil moves with the same careful attention he gives to measuring ingredients for the tamales they sell - each number precise, each calculation building toward something solid and real.
A gecko watches from above the kitchen door as Paula orchestrates their tamale operation, her small home transformed into a production line of startling efficiency. Steam rises from huge pots like prayer, while corn husks spread across every available surface carry that particular sheen that comes from generations of knowing exactly how to fold abundance into portable meals. The neighbors don\'t complain about the noise or the hours - they understand something about how real wealth is built, not through loans and leverage, but through steady work and patient accumulation.
When Manuel had his heart attack last week, the doctor advised him to stop drinking Coca-Cola by the liter. \"No problem,\" he said, his face holding none of the panic I\'ve seen in supposedly wealthier people when health issues threaten their ability to make mortgage payments or keep up with car loans. Their rental income will carry them through his recovery. The properties they bought slowly, carefully, with cash saved peso by peso, now form a safety net woven from decades of choosing delayed gratification over immediate appearance.
The tourist groups that come through our neighborhood take pictures of the \"quaint\" local vehicles - Manuel\'s three old cars that would never meet North American standards. They don\'t see how each one was bought with cash, how each represents freedom from monthly payments, how each has been maintained through knowledge rather than credit. Their own shiny SUVs back home may look more impressive, but their bank owns those until the final payment clears.
A hummingbird pauses by Paula\'s small herb garden, perhaps drawn by the same patient attention to growth that has built their hidden wealth. The tourists don\'t notice how she saves seeds, trades cuttings with neighbors, builds fertility through kitchen scraps rather than store-bought fertilizer. They see poverty in her methods, missing how each careful practice represents choosing abundance over appearance, substance over show.
Through my window, I watch another tour group pause to photograph the \"authentic Mexican neighborhood.\" Their guide mentions local income levels, converting pesos to dollars to demonstrate the economic gap between their world and ours. But his mathematics doesn\'t account for the hidden equations of freedom - how Manuel and Paula\'s take-home pay goes to building more security rather than servicing debt, how their children went through college without student loans, how their small home represents actual ownership rather than thirty years of mortgage payments.
The evening brings the smell of tamales and the sound of Manual and Paula\'s grandchildren playing in the yard. The plastic chairs have been mended again rather than replaced - not from poverty but from that particular wisdom that knows the difference between looking rich and being wealthy. The tourists have gone back to their all-inclusive resorts, perhaps feeling thankful they don\'t have to live in such \"modest\" circumstances. They don\'t understand how modesty sometimes masks mathematics that would make their financial advisors weep with admiration.
Later, Paula brings me tamales still warm from the steamer. We sit in those much-photographed plastic chairs, watching the sunset paint the sky in colors no credit card can buy. She tells me about their plans for a fourth property, about how their careful calculations and patient saving will make it possible without owing anyone a peso. Her hands, smooth from years of working with corn masa, move with the confidence of someone who knows the difference between price and value.
The gecko has moved to watch us from the porch light, perhaps understanding something about how true security often wears humble clothes. The hummingbird makes one last visit to the herb garden before dark. Neither creature carries debt, I think. Neither mistakes appearance for abundance. Neither would trade freedom for show.
Tonight, in air-conditioned homes across the global north, people will make payments on houses they don\'t yet own, on cars they can\'t afford, on lives that look wealthy but feel poor. Meanwhile, Manuel and Paula will sleep the sleep of those who own their lives outright - their small home a castle purchased with cash, their old cars chariots of actual freedom, their careful calculations adding up to a mathematics of true abundance that no tourist\'s camera can capture.

## When Clay Remembers
The clay feels different under my fingers now than when I first learned to shape it as a child. The modern refinement processes remove more impurities, make it more consistent, more predictable. Yet somehow, my hands still find memories in this earth - iron and feldspar, volcanic ash and mountain streams, all the elements that have been flowing together in this valley since before humans learned to make them dance in fire.
This morning at the Kutani workshop, I watch young Matsuda-san throw pots for a hotel chain\'s breakfast service. His wheel is electric now, its speed controlled by foot pedal instead of the steady kick-stroke that left calluses on his grandfather\'s legs. But his hands still move with that particular precision that comes from understanding clay\'s own desires - when it wants to rise, when it needs to rest, when it will accept transformation and when it will stubbornly resist.
\"The hotels want everything identical,\" he tells me, centering another ball of clay with practiced ease. \"Same height, same width, same thickness.\" His hands guide the clay into the required shape, but I notice how he allows subtle variations - a slightly thicker lip here, a more pronounced curve there. \"Clay has its own ideas,\" he grins. \"Why fight what wants to be born?\" The morning light catches the wet surface of his latest piece, revealing the subtle fingermarks that make each one uniquely alive despite their supposed uniformity.
In the glazing room, old Kimura-san experiments with new formulations. Modern regulations have banned many traditional ingredients - the lead that made certain reds sing, the arsenic that gave imperial yellow its particular glow. Her workbench holds both ancient pottery shards and a laptop displaying spectral analysis of mineral compounds. \"We adapt,\" she says, testing a new blend on test tiles. \"But the principles remain. Fire and earth still have to learn to dance together.\"
The walls here sweat with decades of accumulated glaze dust, creating accidental landscapes that could rival any intentional painting. Even the fluorescent lights wear a coating that softens their modern glare, as if the workshop itself refuses to fully surrender to contemporary efficiency. The ancient wood-fired kilns that once burned constantly have been replaced by electric ones with digital controls, yet the potters still speak of the firing\'s \"personality\" - how some days the clay accepts transformation more readily than others, how certain glazes flow differently depending on the weather, the season, the mood of the moment.
A group of design students visits from Tokyo, their tablets filled with CAD drawings of sleek modern forms. They want to understand how to mass-produce their visions while maintaining the \"authentic Kutani feel.\" The old masters exchange knowing looks. \"First learn to listen to the clay,\" Matsuda-san\'s grandfather tells them, his hands scarred from sixty years of craft. \"Then we can talk about production schedules.\"
The students gather around a demonstration wheel, their young faces reflecting blue light from their devices as they record every detail. But their phones can\'t capture the most important part - how the old man\'s body holds decades of dialogue with earth and water, how his fingers read the clay\'s willingness or reluctance, how each vessel emerges from a conversation between human intention and material nature.
\
\"People think tradition means doing things exactly the same way forever,\" Kimura-san tells me later, cleaning glaze from her glasses with practiced motions. \"But the old masters were innovators too. They experimented with new materials, new techniques. The tradition is not in the details - it\'s in the relationship between hand and clay, between earth and fire, between what we intend and what wants to emerge.\"
I watch her test new glazes on discarded shards, each one labeled with precise notes about composition and temperature. The ancient potters did the same, though their notes were kept in memory and muscle rather than computer files. Some of their test pieces still turn up in temple gardens, carrying messages about long-forgotten experiments in gorgeous failure.
The workshop\'s newest member is a 3D printer, used to create precise molds for certain components. The older potters were skeptical at first, but have come to see it as just another tool, no different really from the hand-carved forms their ancestors used. \"As long as human hands still touch clay,\" Matsuda-san says, \"the soul of the craft survives.\" He demonstrates by smoothing rough edges left by the printed mold, his fingers adding subtle irregularities that make each piece feel handmade despite its mechanical origin.
In the afternoon, I help clean kick wheels that haven\'t been used since electric ones arrived. Yet no one suggests removing them. They stand like shrine gates marking the boundary between past and present, their worn surfaces holding the memory of countless hands learning to center clay, to center themselves. An apprentice rests her phone on one while practicing glazing techniques, the ancient wood holding modern technology as naturally as it once held bowls and vases.
*wet clay rises while*
*electric wheel hums old*
*songs - hands remember*\
\
*(what earth teaches here:)*
*wisdom flows through changing forms*
Tonight, after the workshop closes, the clay will continue to move microscopically in wrapped balls and half-finished pieces, responding to temperature and humidity, to barometric pressure and the pull of the moon. The glazes will settle in their bins, minerals seeking their own levels according to laws older than our species. Tomorrow, human hands will again enter this ancient dialogue between earth and fire, finding new ways to let beauty emerge from the conversation between what was and what is becoming.
The clay remembers everything - the volcanic forces that created it, the rivers that refined it, the countless hands that have shaped it through millennia. Perhaps this is the real tradition: not the preservation of specific forms or techniques, but the continuation of this intimate dialogue between human creativity and earth\'s own desires. Each generation adds its own verse to this endless song of transformation, finding new harmonies between necessity and beauty, between efficiency and soul.
## The Shape of Sacred Things
Morning mist still clings to the stone steps of Egara Tenjin when I arrive with my offering - fresh fish wrapped in bamboo leaves, scales catching light like tiny mirrors. A spider has built her web between the shrine gate posts overnight, dew drops on her silk catching sunlight in ways that remind me of prayer beads, of sacred geometry, of how divinity often speaks through simple patterns.
Michiko meets me at the side entrance, already changed from her shrine garments into everyday clothes. Her face holds that particular tension I recognize - the monthly reminder of how bodies keep their own sacred rhythms despite our human rules about purity. The kami must wait while her blood flows, an ancient prohibition that carries its own kind of wisdom about cycles and seasons.
\"You still bring offerings,\" she says, watching me arrange the fish before the shrine. \"Even though you follow theWAY.\" Her voice carries genuine curiosity rather than judgment. A crow lands nearby, perhaps drawn by the fish but staying for what happens next, its dark eyes holding that particular wisdom creatures sometimes show when humans discuss divine things.
My hands still smell of market fish as I explain how theWAY sees the sacred in all things - in the wind that moves through shrine trees, in the stone steps worn smooth by centuries of feet, in the very air that carries incense and crow calls and human prayers all at once. \"The kami are like your neighbors,\" I tell her. \"Whether you call them gods or spirits or forces of nature, they share this world with us. Good neighbors acknowledge each other.\"
Michiko\'s hand moves unconsciously to her lower belly, where her monthly blood speaks its own truth about cycles and seasons. \"But we\'re so different,\" she says. \"Your Way and our traditions.\" The crow hops closer, its head tilted as if following our conversation. Perhaps it remembers when humans didn\'t need different names for sacred things, when all paths led to the same mountain peak.
\"Look,\" I say, pointing to where sunlight streams through the trees, creating patterns on the shrine steps. \"Your tradition sees kami in that light. TheWAY sees divine energy expressing itself through natural phenomena. The words are different, but the light remains itself.\" A leaf falls between us, spinning in that particular way that makes both of us pause to watch its dance. Some beauty needs no theological explanation.
We walk together down the stone steps, past the washing station where pilgrims purify themselves. Michiko tells me about a young shrine visitor who asked why the kami need shelter, why spirits would require human-built structures. Her question reminds me of Mari\'s writings about how divinity sometimes wears human clothes to help us recognize it, how sacred things often speak through forms our limited understanding can grasp.
The crow follows us, hopping from tree to tree like an escort or witness. \"Your ancestors can become divine,\" Michiko says, not quite a question. I explain how theWAY sees spiritual evolution - how consciousness grows through many lives, how human souls can indeed become something larger, something that might well deserve the name kami. Her eyes widen slightly, perhaps recognizing echoes of her own tradition\'s teachings about human spirits becoming celestial beings.
At the bottom of the steps, we pause to watch a spider rebuild her web, destroyed by early morning visitors but beginning again with patient persistence. \"Like that,\" I say. \"Your tradition sees the spider\'s work as part of the natural order the kami oversee. TheWAY sees it as a soul expressing its nature, learning and growing through countless small acts of creation. Different words for the same dance.\"
The morning mist has burned away now, leaving everything sharp and clear in autumn sunlight. Michiko\'s hand has relaxed away from her belly, her face holding that particular softness that comes when artificial boundaries dissolve. \"The kami don\'t care what we call them,\" she says, watching the crow scratch patterns in the dirt - patterns that could be sacred scripts or simple bird behavior, depending on how deeply one looks.
We head toward the shopping district, leaving the shrine but carrying its quiet with us. The crow returns to its post, perhaps understanding something about how humans need different paths up the same mountain, different words for the same light, different rituals to touch the same truth. The spider continues her work, unconcerned with what name we give her sacred geometry.
Later, as we share tea and compare stories about humans seeking answers to eternal questions, I think about how spiritual maturity often looks like recognizing sameness in apparent differences. The crow appears once more outside our window, as if to punctuate this thought. Some wisdom, I suppose, speaks clearly through any tradition that has ears to hear.
*crow watches humans*

## The Wisdom of Silk
The silk workshop smells of cocoons being softened in hot water - a scent like wet wool but sweeter, carrying undertones of mulberry leaves and transformation. My nose runs from the steam rising from the basins where practiced hands tease apart these small miracles of metamorphosis. The women\'s fingers move with unconscious grace, finding the thread\'s beginning with the same instinct that guides spiders to spin, that tells butterflies when to emerge.
Through the workshop\'s windows, I can see mulberry trees swaying in the morning breeze. Their leaves fed the silkworms that spun these cocoons, their cycles of growth and dormancy setting the rhythm for this ancient work. Now electric heaters maintain the water\'s temperature instead of charcoal fires, but the basic alchemy remains unchanged - death becoming thread, thread becoming cloth, cloth becoming beauty that takes wing in new forms.
Yamamoto-san\'s hands move steadily in the steam, her arthritis forgotten as muscle memory takes over. She never learned to read beyond basic characters, yet her body knows volumes about tension and timing, about the precise moment when cocoons will yield their secrets. \"The silk tells you when it\'s ready,\" she says, not looking up from her work. \"Like life - you cannot rush transformation.\" The thin strands shimmer as she draws them out, each cocoon giving up nearly a kilometer of thread that managed to be both impossibly delicate and surprisingly strong.
Behind her, younger workers attend to the reeling machines - modern metal versions of equipment that would still be recognizable to silk workers from centuries past. The principle remains the same: gathering individual strands into thread just thick enough to be useful while maintaining silk\'s characteristic luster. Their hands adjust tension by feel, their eyes constantly assessing the thread\'s consistency. No machine has yet been invented that can match this combination of judgment and touch. Some wisdom lives only in flesh and bone, passed down through generations of attentive bodies.
\"Watch this one,\" Yamamoto-san calls me closer, pointing to a cocoon that seems reluctant to unwind. \"Sometimes they hold on too tight, fighting the very transformation they were meant for.\" Her fingers coax rather than force, waiting for the natural moment of release. I think about how many souls do the same - clinging to old forms, resisting the unraveling that must precede rebirth. The Butterfly Path teaches us that growth requires surrender, yet how many of us battle against our own becoming?
The air fills with tiny fibers that catch the morning light like airborne silk, making even the dust in this place seem charged with potential. My eyes water, my nose runs, my body responding to this subtle storm of transformation. The workers seem unaffected, their bodies long since adapted to moving through these visible signs of change. One woman catches me wiping my eyes. \"When I started,\" she says, \"I cried for weeks. Now my body understands - these are happy tears, marking the beginning of something beautiful.\"
At the wooden looms that fill the workshop\'s far end, older women weave threads into fabric. Their feet work the treadles in rhythms that could be mistaken for meditation - which, in a way, it is. The patterns they create are traditional, yet somehow never exactly the same. Like snowflakes or fingerprints, each length of silk carries subtle variations that mark it as unique, alive, a product of this particular moment and these specific hands.
The wooden frames creak like ship\'s rigging, marking time like temple bells. These sounds haven\'t changed since silk first traveled the ancient roads from China, though now the workshop\'s radio adds news broadcasts and pop songs to the rhythm. Young apprentices check their phones between sections of weaving, their modern lives interweaving with ancient patterns just as naturally as the silk threads they guide.
\"People think we\'re preserving the past,\" says Tanaka-san, the oldest weaver, her fingers moving steadily despite her eighty-seven years. \"But silk has always been about transformation. The worms transform leaves into silk, we transform silk into thread, thread becomes cloth, cloth becomes whatever its wearer needs it to be. Nothing stays fixed - that\'s the beauty of it.\"
I watch her hands move through patterns she\'s woven thousands of times, each pass of the shuttle still attended with full presence. The fabric emerging from her loom shows a subtle variation on a traditional design - butterflies emerging from chrysalises, their wings catching light as they take flight. \"The old patterns are guides,\" she tells me, \"but each piece must find its own way of becoming. Like souls on the Path - we follow ancient wisdom but each journey is new.\"
*soft cocoons yield thread*
*while practiced hands read water\'s*
*warmth like braille - time flows*\
\
*(what silk workers know:)*
*transformation needs witness*
As afternoon light slants through windows clouded with silk fiber, I watch the natural progression of this ancient craft. From death comes thread, from thread comes fabric, from fabric comes beauty that takes wing in new forms. Each stage requires its own kind of wisdom, its own surrender to transformation. The workers move between modern machines and traditional tools with the same fluid grace their bodies bring to drawing out thread - adaptation itself becoming a form of beauty.
Tonight, after the workshop closes, these women will return to homes filled with smartphones and convenience store dinners, their fingers still remembering the feel of silk even as they tap on screens and unwrap modern packaging. Some wisdom runs deeper than time, carried in bodies that remember what it means to participate in transformation. Tomorrow they\'ll return, their hands taking up ancient work with new purpose, helping beauty emerge from surrender, finding faith in the endless dance of becoming.
## The Taste of Tomorrow
The new vendor across from my stall serves her son tamago kake gohan from a chipped blue bowl. Her fingers tremble slightly as she breaks the egg, its yolk catching morning light like a small sun. The boy watches with complete attention, his whole body focused on this daily ritual that transforms simple ingredients into something sacred.
I notice how her nails are worn to the quick, hands roughened by work that hasn\'t yet brought reward. Her shoes have taken on that particular shape poverty gives to leather - the soles worn thin in places that speak of long hours standing, the creases holding dirt that no amount of cleaning can remove. Her hair escapes its attempted bun in grey-streaked wisps, the ends split and wiry from too many missed treatments, too many nights spent calculating how to stretch too little money across too many needs.
The fish in her display aren\'t the choice cuts that draw wealthy customers. She can only afford what\'s left after the established vendors have claimed their pick from the morning\'s catch. Even the ice in her bins holds that slightly clouded quality that comes from being reused too many times. Other vendors avert their eyes from her struggle, as if hardship might be contagious. Customers glance at her stall then move on, their faces holding that particular expression of judgment masked as pity.
But watch how she serves the egg over rice to her son. Her movements carry the precision of tea ceremony, the dignity of shrine ritual. The boy receives his bowl with both hands, bowing slightly - a gesture so natural it could only have been learned through daily practice rather than instruction. They sit together on their small wooden crate, knees touching, sharing this meal like emperors dining on gold.
A mouse peeks out from beneath my ice bin, whiskers twitching at the scent of their breakfast. It knows something about surviving on what others overlook, about finding abundance in simple things. The woman catches its movement and, instead of shrieking or throwing something, she smiles and drops a few grains of rice near her feet. Even in her own hunger, she understands about sharing.
Their rice is the cheap kind that never quite cooks to proper stickiness. The egg likely came from the discount market where blemished produce goes to die. Yet watching them eat, I remember what Mari wrote about how love transforms ordinary things - how a crust of bread shared in prison became a feast, how water offered in kindness tasted sweeter than wine.
The boy tells his mother about a dream he had, his chopsticks moving in the air to illustrate his story. Her attention to his words is complete - the kind of listening that makes the listener larger somehow, that turns small stories into epic tales. Their laughter carries that particular warmth that comes from bellies and hearts being filled simultaneously.
A gecko on the wall above them pauses its morning hunt to watch, perhaps recognizing something about how life persists, adapts, finds way to flourish in unlikely places. The woman\'s shoulders, though bowed by work and worry, hold a dignity no hardship can erase. Her eyes, when they meet mine, carry no shame - only a clear recognition of her own worth that no empty stall or worn-out shoes can diminish.
Other vendors whisper behind their hands about how she can\'t possibly succeed, how she should find other work, how the market has no room for another struggling stall. They don\'t see what I see - how she wipes her son\'s face with the edge of her sleeve, the gesture containing all the tenderness that builds empires. How she straightens her shoulders before each potential customer, her spine carrying the steel that survives winters and transforms them into springs.
The egg and rice disappear slowly, savored down to the last grain. No matter what the day brings - whether customers come or don\'t come, whether the ice holds or melts, whether other vendors acknowledge her presence or continue their practiced invisibility - this morning meal holds enough nourishment to sustain more than just bodies. Some hungers run deeper than flesh, and some foods feed more than just the belly.
I think about how success grows like rice - from small seeds planted in dark places, watered by ordinary love, fertilized sometimes with tears. About how the most important ingredients in any meal are the ones that can\'t be bought - dignity served on chipped plates, respect offered despite empty stalls, love shared in morning light between mother and son.
The gecko darts away as the market grows busier. The mouse returns to its hidden spaces. But something remains in the air around their stall - an aroma more nourishing than fish or rice or eggs could explain. Something about how hope tastes on a worn-out tongue, how tomorrow\'s abundance can be seeded in today\'s careful sharing of simple things.
I\'ve seen how markets work, how success takes root and grows. This woman\'s stall will flourish - not because of what she sells, but because of what she already possesses. The customers who pass her by today will stop tomorrow, drawn by something they can\'t quite name. They\'ll find themselves lingering, not just for fish but for a taste of whatever transforms simple rice and egg into feasts fit for emperors.
The boy helps his mother clean their bowl, his movements mirroring her care for their meager possessions. In this too, there is wealth being accumulated - the kind that can\'t be counted in coins but sustains generations. Their eyes meet over the empty bowl, holding something that makes gold look pale and poor in comparison. This is how fortunes are built - not just in lucky catches or wealthy customers, but in small moments of shared dignity, in the careful appreciation of simple abundance, in the recognition that some riches can\'t be bought or sold but only grown through daily tending of love\'s quiet seeds.
*mother breaks egg while*

## The Space Between Seeing
This morning, the beggar\'s hands trembled more than usual when I gave him his sandwich. The tremors had that particular quality that comes not from cold or withdrawal, but from something deeper - as if his body were trying to shake loose from reality itself. His fingernails were rimmed with black, skin weathered to leather by sun and neglect. But it was his eyes that caught me - clear for once, focused, seeking something I couldn\'t name.
An hour later, he appeared at my market stall, crossing boundaries I\'d never seen him cross before. The other vendors tensed - they know him as the man who talks to invisible beings, who sometimes shouts at demons only he can see. His presence here, among the fresh fish and paying customers, violated the unspoken rules that keep our commercial world turning smoothly.
He stood at that precise distance that marks the edge of social acceptance - not close enough to disturb my customers, not far enough to pretend he wasn\'t there. His eyes met mine with an intelligence that made my stomach clench. No mumbling today, no desperate avoidance. Just that steady gaze that asked something I couldn\'t understand, in a language I couldn\'t speak.
My hands kept moving - muscle memory continuing to clean fish while my mind raced. The metallic scent of fish blood mixed with the particular sour-sweet odor of unwashed human, creating a perfume that spoke of all the ways we fail each other. Around us, customers stepped carefully away, their bodies unconsciously creating a void that marked him as other, as someone whose suffering exceeded our capacity to acknowledge.
What do you do when someone\'s need is so vast it swallows all your possible responses? My extra sandwich felt suddenly pathetic - a token gesture that changed nothing, solved nothing. The tobacco I sometimes give him, which he rolls in newspaper with careful precision, seems now like permission to slowly die, not kindness at all.
Through my open stall window, I could smell rain approaching - that metallic tang that precedes storms. His clothes weren\'t waterproof. His cardboard sleeping spot behind the *arboles* would soon be soaked. These facts sat in my stomach like lead, like the weight of all the world\'s insufficient answers.
He kept standing there, eyes steady now, more present than I\'d ever seen him. What was he trying to tell me? What help was he seeking that I couldn\'t give? My hands moved mechanically through their familiar tasks - scaling, gutting, cleaning - while my heart thrashed like a fish in unexpected air.
Time stretched between us like a taught string. Customers came and went, money changed hands, ordinary commerce continued its dance. But he stood, watching, until something in his face changed - a light going out, a door closing. Then he turned and walked away, back straight, steps deliberate. My heart went with him, torn from my chest by the immensity of what I couldn\'t do.
*man stands watching*
*while fish blood marks passing time \-\--*
*some needs have no words*\
\
*(what flesh remembers:)*
*helplessness tastes like copper*
The rest of my day moved through its familiar patterns - customers haggling over prices, fish being cleaned, ice slowly melting in the afternoon heat. But my hands kept trembling slightly, marking each task with the subtle tremor of insufficient response. What good is an extra sandwich, a bit of tobacco, when what\'s needed is something far deeper - perhaps something our whole society has forgotten how to give?
Tonight, I\'ll make tomorrow\'s sandwich anyway. I\'ll buy more tobacco, though my conscience protests this small mercy that might hasten his end. I\'ll continue these token gestures because they\'re all I have to offer. But my body will remember his eyes, the weight of that wordless request, the vast space between seeing someone\'s pain and having the power to heal it.
The fish know something about this, I think. Each day, I watch them slowly die on ice, their eyes filming over with that particular clouding that marks the transition from life to food. We can\'t save everything. We can\'t heal every wound. Sometimes all we can do is witness, hold space, acknowledge the impossibility of adequate response.
But oh, how that knowledge sits like stones in the belly, like salt in fresh wounds. How it makes mockery of our spiritual pretensions, our careful philosophies, our attempts at ordered meaning. Here is a soul drowning in plain sight, and all I have to offer is bread and leaves wrapped in yesterday\'s news.
Late at night, after too many hours reading psychiatric websites and medical journals, my eyes burn from the blue screen\'s glare. Most of the technical language slides past my comprehension - terms like \"negative symptoms\" and \"disorganized thinking\" that try to categorize the uncategorizable. But one line catches in my throat like a fish bone: \"Sometimes they experience rare and brief episodes of clarity.\"
The words hit me like a physical blow, making my stomach clench with belated understanding. Those eyes that met mine today - was that one of those moments? Did he surface briefly from whatever storms rage in his mind, only to find himself still standing in a world that had long ago decided he was unreachable? Did he come looking for connection in that brief window of clarity, only to find me paralyzed by my own inadequacy?
The thought makes my hands shake so badly I have to set down my phone. To think that in his moment of reaching out, all I could do was stand there, bound by social conventions and my own uncertainty. What did he see in those clear moments? What did he want to say? By the time I saw the light fade from his eyes, was he already submerging back into his private chaos?
The rain has started now. Somewhere in the city, he seeks shelter, carries his invisible battles, lives a pain I can neither understand nor ease. My hands smell of fish and failure. Tomorrow, I\'ll make another sandwich. It will not be enough. Nothing, perhaps, would be enough. This too is part of the human journey - this space between seeing and saving, between witnessing and healing, between the vastness of need and the poverty of response.
The market cats watched me close my stall, their eyes holding their own ancient wisdom about the limits of help, about how sometimes presence is all we can offer to a world so full of wounds. Perhaps they knew something I\'m still learning - about how to carry the weight of insufficient response, about how to keep reaching out even when we know our reach will fall short.
Like the fish, we do what we can. Like the rain, we fall where we must. Like the cats, we witness what we cannot change. And somehow, in all of this not-enough, something holy still moves - in the trying, in the failing, in the getting up to try again tomorrow.
## The Language of Hunger
The market restaurant\'s wooden tables hold more stories than their worn surfaces show. This morning, I watch a tour group from Texas order enough food for three families, their voices carrying that particular tone of people who mistake abundance for wealth. Their guide translates their demands for \"authentic local cuisine,\" though their eyes skitter away from anything too real - the fish heads, the unfamiliar herbs, the parts of animals that remind them meat comes from living beings.
Through the kitchen\'s open window, I see Doña Lucia\'s hands moving in ancient rhythms, preparing rice the way her grandmother taught her. Her every motion holds a prayer - the way she rinses each grain, how she tests the water\'s level with her knuckle, the small bow of thanks before she lights the flame. Meanwhile, the tourists discuss their dietary restrictions and Instagram aesthetics, their phones already positioned to capture proof of their cultural experience.
A gecko watches from above the stove, perhaps drawn by the contrast between Doña Lucia\'s quiet reverence and the loud demands from the dining room. Its tail twitches when one customer sends back a perfectly good fish because it dares to look like what it is - a creature that once lived in the sea.
At the corner table, an elderly Vietnamese woman shares a simple meal with her granddaughter. They\'ve brought their own herbs from home - humble greens that most would overlook. Each leaf is placed with careful attention, transforming their modest bowl of noodles into something that makes the tourists\' overloaded plates look somehow empty in comparison. The grandmother picks up a fallen grain of rice with her chopstick tip, teaching without words about respect for what feeds us.
\"More sauce!\" one tourist demands, drowning the delicate fish in a flood of manufactured heat that masks any natural flavor. His companion drops half a tortilla on the floor, leaving it for others to clean up. I remember my own teacher\'s words about how you can read a person\'s whole philosophy of life in how they treat food - whether they see it as mere fuel or recognize it as a sacred connection between earth and body, between farmer and eater, between all the seen and unseen hands that bring sustenance to our tables.
The Vietnamese grandmother notices my attention and meets my eyes with a small smile of recognition. Her own gaze takes in the tourists\' table, where dishes pile up half-eaten, sauces mixed carelessly together, phones recording everything but tasting nothing. Her face holds no judgment, only a sort of patient sadness - the kind that comes from knowing what\'s been lost can still be found, if only people remember how to look.
In the kitchen, Doña Lucia\'s daughter Maria prepares garnishes with the same care her mother shows the rice. Each cilantro sprig, each lime wedge, each sliver of radish is handled as if it were precious - because it is. The tourists will push these aside, seeking only the heavy proteins, the familiar flavors, the comfortable tastes that don\'t challenge their assumptions about what food should be.
A mouse peeks out briefly near the kitchen door, drawn by fallen crumbs. It pauses to clean each morsel carefully before eating, showing more reverence for food than some who sit at tables. The Vietnamese girl sees it and, instead of shrieking, carefully places a grain of rice where it can reach safely. Her grandmother nods approval - one more lesson passed down in the ancient language of sharing food.
\"This is too simple,\" I overhear one tourist complain about a perfect tortilla soup, its broth clear as truth, rich with time and tradition. They add hot sauce until it burns, then order drinks to numb the heat. Doña Lucia receives this feedback with the same calm she shows when accepting praise - she knows the worth of what she serves, carries generations of wisdom in each recipe. Her soup needs no defense; it speaks its own truth to those who know how to listen.
Near the kitchen, a young Mexican mother shares her lunch break with her son. They have only one dish between them, but they eat with the kind of attention that transforms simple fare into feasts. Each bite is shared, appreciated, received as gift rather than taken as right. The boy carefully wipes his mouth, handles his tortilla with respect, thanks his mother and the cook with equal sincerity. The tourists\' children, meanwhile, play with their food, their phones, everything but their own capacity to taste and appreciate.
The Vietnamese grandmother finishes her meal, gathering the herb stems to take home for stock. Nothing will be wasted. Even the shrimp shells will flavor tomorrow\'s broth, the lime peels will dry for tea. Her granddaughter helps collect every grain of rice, their movements holding the same grace as temple offerings. Nearby, a tourist scrapes a half-full plate into the trash, not seeing how the old woman\'s shoulders tense slightly at this casual desecration.
I think about how prosperity can make us poor in strange ways - rich in options but bankrupt in appreciation, wealthy in quantity but impoverished in our capacity to taste deeply, to receive food as the miracle it is. The tourists leave large tips but small gratitude, their phones full of images but their bodies somehow empty of the real nourishment shared food can bring.
The gecko has moved to watch the Vietnamese pair leave, perhaps recognizing in them something about how life persists through careful attention to small gifts, through passing down not just recipes but reverence. The mouse makes one more appearance, gathering the few crumbs left from their modest meal - even these will be shared with its nest, transformed by small generosity into continued life.
Tonight, after the restaurant closes, Doña Lucia will clean her kitchen with the same care she shows in cooking. Her movements will hold prayers for those who ate here - even, perhaps especially, for those who didn\'t know how to receive what she offered. The Vietnamese grandmother\'s herbs will flavor another meal, the mouse will share its gathered crumbs, the gecko will hunt in blessed quiet. And tomorrow, more stories will be written in how people approach their food - stories about who we are, what we value, and what we\'ve forgotten about the sacred nature of sharing sustenance.

## When Broken Things Speak Truth
This morning, my fingers still smelling of fish market, I watched old Tanaka-sensei repair a cracked Kutani tea bowl. His workbench sits beneath fluorescent lights now, his traditional tools arranged next to a digital scale and modern epoxies. Yet his hands move with the same assurance that guided craftsmen centuries ago, reading the ceramic\'s flaws like braille, understanding each piece\'s particular voice.
The crack in this bowl tells its own story - a careless moment, a too-quick movement, perhaps a child\'s eager hands serving tea to grandmother. Rather than disguising this history, Tanaka-sensei will highlight it with gold, transforming accident into artistry through kintsugi. \"Every break creates space for light to enter,\" he says, carefully cleaning the edges where the ceramic split. His fingers, swollen with arthritis, handle the fragments with the peculiar tenderness reserved for things that have proven their fragility.
The workshop itself embodies this philosophy of honest repair. Its traditional wooden beams are reinforced with modern steel brackets, their industrial ugliness left intentionally visible rather than hidden behind false panels. The old clay mixing wheel, worn smooth by generations of hands, now sits beside an electric kiln with digital controls. Each adaptation marks another chapter in the building\'s story, another gold seam in its continuing life.
Young apprentices learn on practice pieces now, their first attempts at repair made on mass-produced cups from the hundred-yen shop. \"Different time, different materials,\" Tanaka-sensei shrugs, \"but the principles remain.\" Their hands must still learn to read ceramic the way blind men read faces - through touch, through patience, through accepting each piece\'s particular nature. Some of these students come from Komatsu\'s technical high school, their minds full of engineering principles and material science. Yet here they learn what machines cannot calculate - how clay remembers its trauma, how glaze holds memory of fire, how each piece carries its maker\'s breath in microscopic bubbles trapped beneath its surface.
A delivery truck arrives, bringing boxes of broken treasures from modern homes - family heirlooms damaged in earthquakes, beloved everyday pieces that refused to die quietly in landfills. Each crack, each chip, each shattered element offers a chance for transformation. \"In my grandfather\'s time,\" Tanaka-sensei tells me, his hands steady despite his age, \"only the wealthy could afford kintsugi repair. Now people bring me their favorite coffee mugs, their children\'s first tea bowls, their grandmother\'s ramen cups. The gold may be cheaper, the techniques adapted, but the truth remains - what has been broken can become more beautiful through honest repair.\"
This is what the tourist books miss when they mourn the \"loss of traditional crafts.\" They don\'t see how necessity mothers new forms of beauty, how adaptation itself becomes a kind of authenticity. In the corner, an apprentice repairs a contemporary thermal coffee mug, its high-tech materials requiring new techniques. Yet her hands move with the same careful attention that guided ancient masters. The gold seam she creates will tell this cup\'s story - not just of its breaking, but of how ancient art finds new forms through willing hands.
The air fills with the particular scent of urushi lacquer, sharp and living, making my nose run despite the modern ventilation system. This too is part of the craft\'s truth - how it demands physical engagement, how it marks its makers with allergies and stained hands and the deep patience that comes from working with materials that cannot be rushed. Even the apprentices\' smartphones, carefully sealed in plastic bags to protect them from lacquer dust, bear witness to this marriage of times - their alarms marking drying times, their cameras documenting techniques that once passed solely from hand to hand.
\"Look here,\" Tanaka-sensei calls me over, pointing to a place where gold seams from different repairs intersect on an ancient tea bowl. \"This piece has been broken and repaired at least four times, by different hands in different eras. Each line tells its story, each repair adds to its character. This is the bowl\'s life, written in gold.\" His fingertip traces the seams like reading braille, feeling how past and present flow together through these shining rivers of repair.
The afternoon light slants through windows clouded with pottery dust, catching on gold seams of countless broken things in various stages of healing. Each repair marks not just damage but renewal, not just history but continuity. Modern epoxy mingles with ancient techniques, new breaks align with old repairs, today\'s hands learn from centuries of accumulated wisdom how to make beauty from brokenness.
*gold seams catch light where*
*bowl once broke, while new hands learn*
*ancient ways to heal*\
\
*(what broken things teach:)*
*truth flows through honest repair*
Tonight, after the workshop closes, Tanaka-sensei will wipe his workbench clean with the same gesture his grandfather used, his great-grandfather before him. The fluorescent lights will dim on tools old and new, on breaks healing under gold, on the quiet beauty of things that survive through adaptation rather than preservation. Tomorrow, more broken pieces will arrive, carrying stories of modern lives lived fully enough to result in damage. And willing hands will continue this ancient practice of making beauty from brokenness, finding new ways to let light shine through life\'s inevitable cracks.
## The Language of Fire
At the Puerto Vallarta market this morning, I watch Doña Teresa arrange her chili display with the same precision others might arrange altar flowers. Each variety has its place, its purpose, its particular spirit. Her fingers, darkened by decades of handling these bright messengers of heat and flavor, move with the certainty of a priest selecting incense - this one for awakening, this for comfort, this for memories of grandmothers\' kitchens long gone.
A young mother approaches the stall, her baby strapped to her back, sound asleep despite the market\'s chaos. She asks for chilis for her son\'s first solid foods. Doña Teresa\'s face softens with understanding. Her hands hover over her collection before selecting tiny, mild chilis that gleam like garnets in morning light. \"Para que crezca fuerte,\" she says - so he\'ll grow strong. Not just the flesh, I realize, but the spirit too, being slowly trained to read this ancient language of heat and flavor.
A tourist couple stops nearby, their phones ready to document \"authentic Mexican spices.\" They point to the darkest, most intimidating chilis, wanting bragging rights about their tolerance for heat. Doña Teresa\'s eyes hold that particular patience I\'ve seen in temple keepers watching visitors mistake ritual objects for souvenirs. She tries to explain about balance, about how different chilis speak different truths, about how the hottest isn\'t always the wisest choice. But they want sensation, not wisdom.
Near her scales, a small green lizard does push-ups on a sunny spot, perhaps drawn by the subtle aromatics that even my foreign nose can detect. The chilies release their secrets slowly throughout the day - notes of smoke, of earth, of rain-soaked volcanic soil. Doña Teresa\'s grandson plays nearby, casually munching on what would send most foreigners running for water. His young tongue already fluent in a language my own may never fully learn.
\"This one,\" she tells a regular customer, holding up a chili that seems unremarkable to my untrained eyes, \"is for when your husband\'s liver needs cleansing.\" The woman nods, understanding something passed down through generations about how certain heats heal, how some fires purify. I think about how many of us have lost this kind of knowledge - about foods that speak directly to specific organs, about flavors that carry medicine in their ancient DNA.
An older woman approaches, her face bearing that particular grief of recent widowhood. Without words being exchanged, Doña Teresa selects certain chilis, wraps them carefully in newspaper. \"Para el corazón,\" she says softly - for the heart. Not just the physical heart, I realize, but the deeper heart that needs its own kind of warming when grief has left it cold. The widow clutches the package like medicine, which of course it is.
The tourists have moved on, disappointed perhaps that no one praised their bravado in handling heat. They miss how a young couple lingers at the stall, shyly requesting chilis for their wedding feast. Doña Teresa\'s selection process becomes almost ceremonial - these for passion, these for fertility, these for the harmony of shared meals over decades to come. Her hands move through her chilies like a matchmaker introducing old friends who she knows will dance well together.
A chef from one of the beachfront restaurants strides up, speaking rapid English about Scoville units and customer expectations. Doña Teresa simply hands him a small wrinkled chili that makes him pause mid-sentence. \"Pruébalo,\" she insists - taste it. When he does, his face changes, softens. This heat carries something his culinary school never taught - memories of grandmothers\' kitchens perhaps, of wisdom passed down through showing rather than telling.
I think about how many of us approach food as fuel or entertainment, missing its deeper languages. The young mother returns to the stall with her now-wakened baby, who reaches toward the chilis with uncertain fingers. Doña Teresa selects a mild one, lets him hold it, begin his education in reading heat\'s ancient stories. His mother beams with pride - another generation entering this river of fire-carried wisdom.
Near closing time, I watch Doña Teresa sort her remaining stock, her fingers moving in unconscious blessing over each chili. Some she\'ll dry for tomorrow, others she\'ll grind into complex spice mixtures whose recipes exist only in her mind and muscles. The lizard has moved to watch her work, perhaps understanding something about how wisdom lives in the spaces between sensation and memory, between fire and flavor, between what feeds the body and what nourishes deeper hungers.
Tonight, in homes throughout the city, these chilis will be crushed, toasted, soaked, transformed. They\'ll carry their messages of healing and hope, of passion and remembrance, of strengths that can only be learned through patient training of tongue and spirit. Each meal will speak in flavors that my foreign palate can only partially translate, each bite an conversation between past and present, between earth and human, between fire and wisdom.
The tourist couple\'s photos will show bright colors and exotic shapes, but they\'ll miss the true story - how every chili in Doña Teresa\'s stall carries centuries of careful observation, of knowledge passed from hand to hand, of wisdom earned through generations of listening to what fire has to teach. Some languages can only be learned from birth, some heats warm more than just the tongue, some fires light more than just the mouth.

## The Colors We Stand to Lose
Don Eduardo\'s cornfield catches dawn light like stained glass - purple, red, blue, and gold tassels dancing in morning breeze. His weathered hands move through the stalks with a tenderness usually reserved for touching sacred things, which of course these are. Each variety he grows carries stories older than pyramids - this blue corn perfect for tortillas that taste of mountain rain, that red strain whose kernels hold the exact sweetness for atole, the black corn whose deep purple makes masa that carries ancestors\' voices.
A crow watches from a fence post, perhaps drawn by the ancient partnership between human and grain that has shaped this landscape longer than any of us can remember. Don Eduardo notices its presence and nods - both of them knowing something about survival against odds, about keeping old wisdom alive in a world rushing toward convenient uniformity.
\"Look,\" he says, holding up an ear of corn so dark blue it almost hurts the eyes. His fingers trace the perfect spiral of kernels, pointing out how each one carries slightly different shades - indigo fading to twilight to dawn. \"This one knows how to talk to the gods,\" he tells me, and though my foreign mind wants to categorize this as superstition, my body recognizes truth when it speaks through twelve thousand years of careful cultivation.
The agrochemical salesmen come regularly now, their shiny trucks carrying promises of bigger yields, easier work, better profits. Their pamphlets show uniform golden corn, each ear identical, each kernel perfect. They don\'t mention how their seeds can\'t be saved, how their corn requires specific pesticides that only they can sell, how accepting their offer means entering a cycle of dependency as tight as any addiction.
A hummingbird darts between the corn stalks, its iridescent feathers matching the subtle variations in the heritage kernels. Don Eduardo\'s daughter watches it while calculating production costs on her phone. She knows the numbers don\'t add up - how can they compete with industrial farms getting twice the yield? Her father\'s corn takes longer to grow, needs more space between plants, requires careful handling of each variety\'s specific needs. The market doesn\'t care about twelve thousand years of agricultural wisdom when cheaper options exist.
\"This one,\" Don Eduardo says, holding up a pale gold ear with kernels that shine like tiny moons, \"knows how to survive drought.\" His fingers move across its surface with the same reverence I\'ve seen priests show ancient texts. \"Not by drinking more water,\" he explains, \"but by knowing how to live with less.\" The agrochemical salesmen\'s corn requires irrigation systems, specific fertilizers, constant inputs. His corn remembers how to talk with rain, how to negotiate with dry seasons, how to root deep and find what it needs.
In his small processing shed, different varieties are stored in carefully labeled clay containers. Each one has its purpose - this for tortillas that will hold their shape without cracking, this for tamales that steam to perfect softness, this for *pozole* that carries the flavor of specific mountains, specific soils, specific dreams. The industrial corn that threatens to replace them produces uniform masa with uniform flavor, bred for shelf life rather than soul life.
A mouse peeks out from between the corn containers, perhaps drawn by ancient memory of how its ancestors evolved alongside these plants, each shaping the other through millennia of shared survival. Don Eduardo sees it but makes no move to chase it away. \"Even the mice know,\" he says. \"Each variety feeds different hungers.\" The agrochemical corn, he explains, fills bellies but leaves something else hungry - the part of us that needs to taste connection to earth and sky, to ancestors and old wisdom, to the particular flavor of home.
His daughter shows me the letters from the bank, the profit projections, the cold equations that say tradition costs too much. The industrial seeds promise thirty percent more yield, the pesticides eliminate need for manual weeding, the uniform plants can be harvested by machine rather than careful hands. Everything would be easier, more profitable, more modern. Everything would be less alive.
Don Eduardo moves through his field like a literacy teacher showing off a precious library. This bright red corn learned how to grow in high altitudes, its kernels carrying generations of adaptation to thin air. That blue variety knows how to resist specific fungi that attack valley-bottom plants. The gold one remembers how to grow strong in rich volcanic soil. Each one carries wisdom earned through centuries of careful observation, of partnership between human and plant intelligence.
\"They say their corn is stronger,\" he tells me, his voice carrying that particular tone of someone stating an obvious untruth. \"But strength isn\'t about growing fast or big. It\'s about knowing how to belong to a place, how to speak with soil and weather, how to carry wisdom forward.\" His hands move constantly as he speaks, touching corn leaves like reading braille, his fingers fluent in a language industrial agriculture has forgotten exists.
The crow has moved closer, watching us discuss the fate of these ancient partnerships. Don Eduardo\'s daughter makes another calculation on her phone, her face holding that particular pain of someone caught between worlds - between honoring wisdom and surviving modern pressures, between keeping tradition and keeping the farm. The hummingbird darts past again, its wings humming at exactly the frequency that makes the corn leaves tremble in response.
Tonight, Don Eduardo will cook us corn from seven different varieties - each one requiring specific preparation, each one carrying distinct flavor, each one telling its own story about how food can feed more than just bodies. His daughter will take more pictures of the production costs, the market prices, the hard math of modern survival. The crow will return to its perch, watching this latest chapter in the long dance between profit and wisdom, between efficiency and soul, between what feeds us quickly and what nourishes us deeply.
The sun catches the corn tassels again, turning them to stained glass, to prayer flags, to signals between earth and sky. Some losses can\'t be measured in yields or profits. Some wisdom, once forgotten, can\'t be bought back at any price.
*ancient corn whispers*
*while profit calculators*
*count what we can\'t keep*\

*(what seeds teach here:)*
*some wealth can\'t be measured whole*
## The Space Between Madness and Vision
The local herb woman keeps a special chair outside her stall for Miguel, who speaks in prophecies and riddles. This morning, while I arranged my fish display, I watched her hand him tea in a chipped blue cup - the same cup she uses for all her \"special cases.\" His hands trembled as he took it, his eyes focused on something none of us could see, but his body knew exactly how to settle into that chair, how to belong in a space that made room for his difference.
How different from what I witnessed in Toronto, where my cousin\'s son was hospitalized in a place that smelled of antiseptic and artificial lavender - scents designed to mask the raw humanity they contained. The chairs there were molded plastic, easy to sanitize, impossible to settle into. Everything designed to remind visitors that this was a medical space, that the mysteries of mind and spirit could be reduced to chemical equations and diagnostic codes.
The herb woman\'s tea contains ingredients passed down through generations - herbs for quieting troubled thoughts, for easing the body\'s tension, for making space between reality and whatever lies beyond it. She never tries to \"fix\" Miguel. She simply makes room for him, the way the market makes room for the cats who live in its shadows, each one adding its own note to our daily symphony.
Through my stall window, I can hear him speaking now - something about angels in the fish scales, about messages written in the patterns of melting ice. In Toronto, such talk would be labeled \"religious delusions,\" carefully noted in medical charts, treated with medications designed to silence the voices. Here, people pause to listen. Not because they believe his visions, but because they understand that sometimes wisdom comes wrapped in strange packages, that the line between prophecy and madness has always been thinner than we like to admit.
My fish market teacher used to say that truth speaks through many voices, not all of them convenient or comprehensible. I think about this while watching Miguel trace patterns in spilled water on my counter. His fingers move with that particular precision that comes from seeing order in chaos, meaning in randomness. The customers step around him carefully, some leaving small offerings of fruit or bread beside his feet. Not out of fear or superstition, but from that ancient understanding that those who walk between worlds need anchoring in this one.
In the psychiatric unit in Toronto, my cousin\'s son was not allowed to wear his own clothes, to keep his prayer beads, to perform the small rituals that helped him feel human. Everything that made him unique was labeled symptomatic, every attempt at meaning-making seen as evidence of illness. His body responded with the particular tension of a wild animal caged - muscles tight, eyes wary, movement constrained by walls both visible and invisible.
Here, Miguel wears layers of mismatched clothes, each one chosen for reasons only he understands. Ribbons tied around his wrists mark private ceremonies, prayers, remembrances. His beard contains small trinkets - bright threads, tiny bells, things that catch light and make music when he moves. In Toronto, these would be seen as signs of deterioration. Here, they\'re recognized as a unique language, a way of speaking when ordinary words fail.
The herb woman tells me that in her grandmother\'s time, people like Miguel were seen as bridges - not quite in this world, not quite in another, but spanning both. Their struggles were understood as the natural consequence of trying to exist in two realities at once. \"Like trying to keep one foot on the dock and one in a boat,\" she says, her hands moving constantly as she sorts her herbs. \"Of course they stumble sometimes. Of course they see things we don\'t. They\'re trying to balance worlds.\"
*man traces patterns*
*in fish blood while angels speak \-\--*
*some truths have no tongue*\
\
*(what worlds whisper here:)*
*wisdom flows through broken gates*
Last week, a young doctor visited our market, conducting research on \"folk medicine approaches to mental illness.\" She took careful notes about the herb woman\'s teas, about the community\'s acceptance of Miguel\'s differences, about the informal support systems that had evolved around those who walk different paths. Her pen moved rapidly across her notebook, trying to quantify what she saw, to translate it into the language of modern psychiatry. But how do you measure the healing power of belonging? How do you chart the effectiveness of being allowed to be exactly who you are?
The herb woman watched the doctor with the same gentle attention she gives to Miguel, offering her tea in the same blue cup. \"In your hospitals,\" she said, \"you try to make everyone walk the same path. But some souls need to dance, even if the music they hear is different from ours.\"
Tonight, as I clean my stall, I watch Miguel perform his evening rituals - touching each corner of the market in a precise order, whispering blessings or warnings or something in between. His movements have that fluid grace that comes from absolute certainty, from following maps only he can see. The herb woman sits quietly in her doorway, keeping watch without watching, holding space without constraining it.
In Toronto, the night shift nurses would be changing now, recording observations in clinical language, administering medications to ensure quiet. Here, the market cats follow Miguel on his rounds, their bodies weaving between his legs, accepting his difference as naturally as they accept the changing of seasons or the turning of tides.
Perhaps there\'s wisdom in both approaches - in the careful study of brain chemistry and the ancient knowledge of healing herbs, in modern medications and traditional ceremonies. But watching Miguel complete his circuits, seeing how his unique dance has become part of our market\'s rhythm, I wonder if what we call madness is sometimes just a different way of moving through the world, a different way of processing its mysteries.
The herb woman\'s blue cup sits empty now, carrying the rings of countless teas served to countless souls who needed space to be themselves. Tomorrow, she\'ll fill it again. Tomorrow, Miguel will return to trace new patterns in water and fish blood. Tomorrow, somewhere in Toronto, fluorescent lights will hum over plastic chairs while doctors record symptoms and adjust medications.
All of us trying to make sense of mystery, all of us trying to help in the ways we know how. But perhaps true healing begins not with trying to fix what we call broken, but with making space for different ways of being whole.
## About the Author
Kaori Mizuki (瑶月) lives in a small house near Kamakura\'s fish market, where she has worked as a vendor for over forty years. Each morning before dawn, she can be found at her stall, carefully arranging the day\'s catch while observing the delicate interplay between commerce and compassion that characterizes market life. Her writings emerge from this intersection of the practical and profound, finding spiritual truth in the most ordinary moments.
Born to a fishing family in post-war Japan, Kaori learned early to read both fish and human nature. Her formal education was limited, but her real learning has come through decades of careful attention to how wisdom manifests in everyday life. She began writing after encountering the Wayist teachings of Lord Iesous and Mari of Magadha through traveling merchants, recognizing in their words the same truth she found in the rhythms of market life.
While primarily known as a teacher of Wayist philosophy, Kaori\'s influence extends beyond religious boundaries. Her commentaries on Mari\'s poems are particularly valued for their ability to illuminate spiritual truths through physical reality. She has a gift for finding profound meaning in what others might consider mundane or even unseemly - the smell of fish blood at dawn, the particular ache of aging joints, the way dying fish eyes reflect truth about impermanence.
A stubborn ume tree grows in her small garden, and a family of cats has adopted both her and her market stall. She continues to work, write, and teach, and during winter months works from her little place in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. She maintains that wisdom comes not from escaping our ordinary human experience but through paying closer attention to it. Her students often note how she can shift seamlessly between discussing the price of mackerel and the nature of divine love, seeing no contradiction between the two.
Kaori\'s writings, like her market work, focus on finding what is fresh and true, trimming away what is spoiled or false. She approaches both tasks with the same careful attention, treating fish and wisdom with equal respect. When asked about her unusual combination of occupations, she often quotes Mari: \"Truth speaks clearest through unwashed fingers.\"
Her previous works include \"The Fishmonger\'s Commentary on the Teaching of theWAY\" and \"Market Meditations: Finding Truth in Ordinary Things.\" This current volume represents decades of living as a teacher of theWAY. Kaori illustrates how through the rote of everyday survival ... life, much like the sea itself always moving in what seems to be a set pattern, offers different gifts to those who know how to look and wait.
A small shrine in the corner of her stall holds a picture of Mari and a bowl of fresh water for stray cats. Each morning, she offers both fresh fish and fresh insights to those who stop by. \"The geckos,\" she says, \"are often better teachers than I am. They know what\'s true.\"
