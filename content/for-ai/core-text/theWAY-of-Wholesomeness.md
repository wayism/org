## Introduction
In the tapestry of human existence, where countless philosophies and belief systems interweave, Wayism glows as a golden foundation of ancient wisdom, offering cognition of the Path to true wholesomeness of mind, body, and spirit. Over millennia, many built their own structures upon these spiritual foundations, but mainly to serve as religions --- and that is how life works. We have soul-dominant and spirit-dominant students on the Path in the same campus.\
As you embark on this journey through the pages of "theWAY of Wholesomeness," you are invited to explore a way of life that not only aligns with ancient wisdom but also resonates with modern scientific understanding of human well-being and happiness.
At the heart of the journey of this book lies the concept of self-awareness --- a quality as precious as it is rare. Recent scientific studies have unveiled what is to western people a startling truth: while 95% of people believe they are self-aware, only 10-15% truly possess this quality. This gap between perception and reality is not merely an academic curiosity; it has profound implications for our happiness, relationships, and overall well-being.
As Wayists, we understand that this disconnect is not a cause for judgment or despair, but an opportunity for growth and transformation. Our philosophy provides us with unique tools and perspectives to cultivate genuine self-awareness, the very purpose of life, bridging the gap between who we think we are and who we really are.
Wayism is not merely a set of beliefs or practices; it is a comprehensive approach to living that encompasses every aspect of our existence. It is a personal life philosophy that provides a framework for understanding our place in the universe, our purpose, and our potential for growth and transformation. In a world often fraught with confusion, stress, and disconnection, Wayism offers a beacon of clarity, peace, and profound connection.
The Wayist approach to self-awareness is multifaceted, recognizing that we are complex beings with multiple 'minds' or centers of consciousness. We understand that self-awareness is not just about knowing our thoughts and emotions, but about understanding the interplay between our soul-minds, spirit-minds, and brain-mind. This holistic view allows us to delve deeper into our true nature, beyond the surface-level understanding that often masquerades as self-awareness.
One of the key reasons why Wayists tend to score higher in self-awareness, is our focus on understanding "what makes us tick." We study the soul-minds of the lower-self and the spirit-minds of the higher-self, recognizing how they cooperate and rely on each other. We understand that the brain-mind, with its subconscious organ minds and microbiome minds, plays crucial roles in regulating our feelings of intimate bonding, contentment, satiety, and happiness. This comprehensive understanding of our inner workings provides us with a more nuanced and accurate self-perception.
However, the path to self-awareness is not without its challenges. The Dunning-Kruger effect reminds us that the least competent are often the most confident in their abilities. As Wayists, we recognize that what we don't know forms our reality of certainty --- and that this can be a significant barrier to true self-awareness. Conversely, we understand that what we know we don't know creates a reality of uncertainty --- a preferable state that keeps us open to growth and new insights.
In the Wayist tradition, we recognize that knowledge is never final, truth is subjective, history is open to interpretation, and memories are malleable. No truth is ever absolute, and no wisdom is ever complete. We continue to add to both over many lifetimes. This perspective keeps us humble and open to continuous learning and self-discovery.
Recent psychological studies have identified key virtues and character strengths associated with happiness, mental health, and overall well-being. What's remarkable is that these scientifically-backed qualities align seamlessly with the teachings of Wayism. From wisdom and courage to humanity and transcendence, Wayism embodies the very traits that modern research links to a fulfilling and joyful life.
As we delve into the principles of Wayism, you will discover how this ancient yet timeless philosophy can transform your life. You'll learn how to cultivate inner peace amidst external chaos, how to find purpose and meaning in everyday experiences, and how to nurture relationships that enrich your soul. Most importantly, you'll uncover the tools to become the architect of your own happiness and wholeness.
This book is not just a guide; it's an invitation to a new way of being. It's a call to awaken to your true nature, to embrace your potential, and to live in harmony with the fundamental truths of existence. Whether you're new to spiritual exploration or a seasoned seeker, "theWAY of Wholesomeness" offers insights and practices that can elevate your life experience.
As we begin this journey together, open your heart and mind to the possibilities that lie ahead. The path to wholesomeness is not always easy, but it is infinitely rewarding. Let us step forward with courage, curiosity, and compassion, ready to embrace the transformative power of Wayism.
Remember, the goal is not perfection, but progress. As we continue on this path, may we approach ourselves and others with compassion, curiosity, and an open heart. For in the end, true self-awareness is not just about understanding ourselves, but about recognizing our interconnectedness with all beings and our place in the grand tapestry of existence.
In the chapters that follow, we will explore the foundations of Wayist wholesomeness, delve into the Wayist worldview, and examine the Wayist concept of self. We'll investigate how our understanding of the multiple minds, our recognition of the Butterfly Path, and our practices of mindfulness and self-reflection all contribute to a more aware, balanced, and fulfilled existence.
As you journey through these pages, may you find not only knowledge, but wisdom, not only understanding, but insight. May the teachings of Wayism illuminate your path, bringing you closer to true self-awareness, wholesomeness, and the profound joy that comes from living in harmony with theWAY.
## Part I: Foundations of Wayist Wholesomeness
Chapter 1
## Understanding the Nature of Existence
At the heart of Wayist philosophy lies a profound understanding of the nature of existence. This understanding is not merely intellectual; it is a lived experience that permeates every aspect of a Wayist's life, bringing about a deep sense of peace, purpose, and connection. By grasping these fundamental truths, we lay the foundation for true wholesomeness and happiness.
### The Absolute, the Source, and The Way
In Wayism, we recognize three foundational concepts that form the basis of all existence: the Absolute, the Source, and The Way.
#### **The Absolute**
The Absolute, often referred to simply as "THAT," is the ultimate reality beyond human comprehension. For us, It is The Ineffable, the Unnamable, the Foundation of All that Is. It cannot be known by humans, who cannot even know what love is or how their own minds work --- were just not capable of knowing, therefore we respectfully do not speak of THAT.
By acknowledging the Absolute, we cultivate humility and wonder. We recognize that there are aspects of existence far beyond our understanding, which frees us from the burden of needing to control or explain everything. This acceptance brings a profound sense of peace and openness to life's mysteries.
#### **The Source**
From the Absolute springs the Source, the wellspring of all energies that flow through the universe. The Source is a realm of divine chaos, pure potential from which all forms emerge.\
Understanding the Source helps us connect with the creative energy of the universe. It reminds us that we, too, are creative beings, capable of shaping our lives and contributing to the world around us. This understanding fosters a sense of empowerment and purpose.
#### **theWAY**
The Way, or theWAY, is a domain in which Universal Energies are structured and governed by laws of metaphysics and physics. It brings order to the necessary chaos of the Source, making our universe possible. It establishes the laws that govern the flow of energies and sets in motion the grand Plan of existence.
By aligning ourselves with The Way, we find our path of least resistance through life. We learn to flow with the natural rhythms of existence rather than struggling against them. This alignment brings ease, grace, and a sense of being in harmony with the universe.
### The Three Energy Domains
Wayism teaches that existence within The Way comprises three distinct energy domains: the Material Energy Domain, the Soul Energy Domain, and the Spirit Energy Domain. Everything in the multiverse is fundamentally energy. Think of the three Energy Domains are three different types of energies that exist separately or individually, but can sometimes co-exist in the same space. Understanding these domains and our place within them is crucial for our wholeness and well-being.
#### **Material Energy Domain**
The Material Energy Domain is the physical world we inhabit. It's governed by the laws of physics and is where these bodies we use for incarnations, exist. By understanding this domain, we learn to care for our physical selves properly by also taking care of the three body-minds, recognizing the importance of health, nutrition, and environmental awareness in our overall well-being.
#### **Soul Energy Domain**
The Soul Energy Domain is the realm within which all soul beings exist. It is also the domain of our lower-self consciousness and individuality. Our soul is an energy being with three soul-minds. It's where our unique personalities and experiences reside. Soul-beings are by nature beset with competing for resources and striving to fulfill endless needs, tribalism, and speciesism. Acknowledging this domain helps us understand our emotions, thoughts, and personal growth journey. It encourages self-reflection and self-improvement, key components of psychological well-being.
#### **Spirit Energy Domain**
The Spirit Energy Domain is the realm of spirit entities and structures. In our spirit-self, it is in this domain that our higher consciousness exists and where we make divine connections. The fledgling spirits attached to our souls have four spirit-minds. It's the source of our highest aspirations and deepest wisdom. By connecting with this domain, we tap into a wellspring of true peace, self-transcendent love, and understanding that transcends our individual egos. This connection is often associated with profound happiness and a sense of fulfillment that goes beyond material success.
### The Purpose of Human Life
In Wayism, we understand that the purpose of human life, that is, all humans who ever existed, is to evolve our mortal souls into immortal spirit-beings.\
Unlike soul-beings and their soul-deities, who are rather violent by nature, spirit-beings are by nature beneficent, and will never do harm or advocate for violence; they do not judge, do not reward, or punish. They have no needs that we can fulfill. They offer us an opportunity to evolve our souls, and whether or not we use the opportunity does not matter to them --- until we awaken our spiritual self and join their family --- and then we are loved as fledgling spirit-beings about to be reborn in their heaven.
There are metaphysical Laws that govern our metaphysical nature and the School. The gods do not make the weather and neither do they help one team to win. They are not involved with running things on Earth. There are metaphysical laws (karma, dharma, maya, and other), and laws of physics in place to manage the curriculum and affairs of nature.
There is no need for spirit-beings to interfere. They will protect our energy essence against attacks and hacks from malevolent soul entities because we are fragile in this hybrid state while at School on Earth, but they don't interfere in how the students run the campus.
We call spirit-beings gods, but in other cultures they are called buddhas, angels, gods, devata, or deva. We cannot appease the gods because they have no needs that we can satisfy --- no need for being worshipped or obeyed, no need to form a club or tribe of "their" people. The ideas of competition, hoarding resources, domination, and tribalism are soul values --- our deities are spirit-beings, not soul-beings.
**The Butterfly Path** is the name given to this journey of the evolution of the soul. It gives our existence a profound meaning and direction.
##### Recognizing this purpose brings numerous benefits to our mental and emotional well-being
1\. **Sense of Direction**\
Knowing our purpose provides a clear direction in life. It helps us prioritize our actions and make decisions aligned with our ultimate goal. This clarity reduces anxiety and indecision, leading to greater peace of mind.
2\. **Resilience**\
Understanding that challenges are opportunities for growth on our evolutionary journey helps us develop resilience. We can face difficulties with courage, knowing they serve a higher purpose in our development.
3\. **Interconnectedness**\
Recognizing that all humans share this common purpose fosters a sense of unity and compassion. It helps us see beyond superficial differences and connect with others on a deeper level, enhancing our relationships and social well-being.
4\. **Transcendence of Fear**\
The knowledge that we are on a journey towards becoming immortal spirit-beings helps alleviate the fear of death. We tend to move through the School of Butterfly Path in groups as students from one grade to another. Additionally, each human has a spirit guardian who safeguards our vital energies, and when we are matured in spirit we can even connect with them. Therefore, we are not alone in this. This knowing transforms our perspective on mortality, reducing existential anxiety and allowing us to live more fully in the present.
5\. **Motivation for Self-Improvement**\
The goal of evolving into a higher form of being provides constant motivation for personal growth and self-improvement. Success in life is not measured in material terms but in advances in soul and self-craft. This drive for betterment is closely linked to feelings of fulfillment and self-actualization.
By embracing this understanding of existence --- the Absolute, the Source, The Way, the three energy domains, and our life's purpose --- we lay a solid foundation for wholeness and happiness. This knowledge isn't merely theoretical; it's a lived wisdom that transforms our daily experience, bringing greater peace, purpose, and joy into every aspect of our lives.
As we continue our exploration of Wayism, we'll build upon this foundation, discovering how these fundamental truths inform our worldview, shape our character, and guide our practices. Each step of the way, we'll see how this ancient wisdom aligns with modern understanding of well-being, offering a path to true wholesomeness in our complex, modern world.
Chapter 2
## The Wayist Worldview
The Wayist worldview is a powerful lens through which we perceive and interact with reality. It provides a framework for understanding the complexities of existence, offering insights that lead to greater peace, acceptance, and personal growth. In this chapter, we'll explore key aspects of the Wayist worldview and how they contribute to our overall well-being and happiness.
### Butterfly Path: School of Divinity for Souls
At the heart of the Wayist worldview is the concept of the Butterfly Path, a metaphor that beautifully encapsulates our journey of spiritual evolution. This path is not just a personal journey; it's a universal school of divinity for all human souls.
Imagine, if you will, the entirety of human existence as a vast, diverse campus. Each life, each experience, is a class in this grand school. Some lessons are joyous and uplifting, while others are challenging and painful. But all are essential for our growth and transformation.
#### Understanding life through the lens of the Butterfly Path brings numerous benefits
1\. **Purpose in Every Experience**\
When we view life as a school, every experience becomes meaningful. Even difficulties are seen as valuable lessons, reducing our tendency to resist or resent challenging situations. This perspective fosters resilience and emotional stability.
2\. **Reduced Judgment of Others**\
Recognizing that we're all students at different stages of development cultivates compassion and understanding. We become less judgmental of others' mistakes or different life choices, leading to more harmonious relationships and a more peaceful society.
3\. **Motivation for Personal Growth**\
The Butterfly Path encourages continuous self-improvement. This aligns with the psychological concept of "growth mindset," which is associated with greater achievement, resilience, and life satisfaction.
4\. **Sense of Cosmic Connection**\
Understanding that we're part of a universal school of divinity fosters a sense of belonging to something greater than ourselves. This cosmic connection is often associated with increased well-being and reduced anxiety.
### People are Not Equal, But All are on the Path
One of the most transformative aspects of the Wayist worldview is the understanding that people are not equal, but all are on the Path. This might seem counterintuitive in a world that often preaches equality, but embracing this truth leads to profound personal and social benefits.
In the Wayist view, inequality is not about worth or dignity --- all beings have inherent value. Instead, it recognizes that we're all at different stages of our spiritual evolution, just as students in a school are at different grade levels.
#### Here's how this understanding contributes to our well-being
1\. **Acceptance of Diversity**\
Recognizing that people are at different stages of development helps us embrace diversity more genuinely. We see different viewpoints and behaviors not as threats, but as expressions of souls at various points on their journey.
2\. **Reduced Social Anxiety**\
When we stop expecting everyone to be at the same level, we relieve ourselves of the pressure to conform or compete unnecessarily. This can significantly reduce social anxiety and stress.
3\. **Improved Self-Acceptance**\
Understanding that we're all on a journey of growth allows us to be more accepting of our own current state. We can acknowledge our areas for improvement without harsh self-judgment.
4\. **Enhanced Empathy**\
Viewing others as fellow travelers on the Path, each facing their own challenges, naturally increases our empathy and compassion.
5\. **Motivation for Personal Development**\
Recognizing that growth is possible and expected encourages us to actively work on our own development, leading to a more fulfilling life.
### Life is Not Fair, But It is Equitable
Another crucial aspect of the Wayist worldview is the understanding that life is not fair, but it is equitable. This perspective offers a profound shift in how we view the challenges and inequalities we encounter in life.
In the Wayist view, the seeming unfairness of life is actually a carefully calibrated system of learning opportunities, governed by the law of Karma. Each soul receives exactly the experiences it needs for its growth and evolution.
#### Embracing this viewpoint brings several benefits
1\. **Reduced Resentment**\
When we stop expecting life to be fair, we let go of resentment towards perceived injustices. This leads to greater peace of mind and emotional well-being.
2\. **Increased Personal Responsibility**\
Viewing life's challenges as tailored learning opportunities encourages us to take responsibility for our growth, rather than feeling like victims of circumstance.
3\. **Enhanced Resilience**\
Understanding that difficulties are not random but serve a purpose in our development helps us face challenges with greater courage and determination.
4\. **Gratitude**\
This perspective often leads to increased gratitude, as we begin to see even difficult experiences as valuable gifts for our evolution.
5\. **Reduced Comparison**\
When we understand that each person's journey is unique and tailored to their needs, we're less likely to fall into the trap of unhealthy comparison with others.
### Karma and Dharma
The concepts of Karma and Dharma are integral to the Wayist worldview, offering a framework for understanding the mechanics of our spiritual evolution and our place in the cosmic order.
Karma, often misunderstood as a system of reward and punishment, it is not. Karma is a metaphysical law that ensures we receive the experiences necessary for our growth. It's the cosmic curriculum designer, so to speak, in the school of life.
Dharma, on the other hand, refers to our unique role or duty in the worlds we live in. Gaining wisdom is the quest of life. With each new layer of wisdom that is formed in the higher-self, comes a reciprocal new layer of duty.
Wisdom is not wisdom unless it is lived --- if not lived, it is merely knowledge that will be lost when the brain dies or gets sick. Therefore, our dharma, our sense of duty, is our individual, personal, value set, our own inner moral code, our own personal path of righteousness, aligned with the greater spiritual good.
#### Understanding Karma and Dharma contributes to our well-being in several ways
1\. **Sense of Cosmic Justice**\
Karma provides a sense that the universe is fundamentally just, which can be deeply reassuring and reduce existential anxiety.
2\. **Motivation for Positive Action**\
Understanding Karma encourages us to act in ways that create positive outcomes, leading to a more ethical and fulfilling life.
3\. **Acceptance of Life's Challenges**\
Viewing difficulties as Karmic lessons helps us accept and learn from challenging experiences rather than feeling victimized by them.
4\. **Sense of Purpose**\
Dharma gives us a sense of unique purpose and place in the world, which is strongly associated with life satisfaction and mental health.
5\. **Ethical Living**\
Following one's Dharma naturally leads to more ethical living, which is associated with greater peace of mind and self-esteem.
6\. **Internal locus of control**\
Rather than "being good" because of an imposed set of moral or legal laws and rules, thus being good because of fear of repercussions from an external authority, the Wayist develops an internal locus of control. We become 'good' from the inside out, we will one day be 'good' by nature, beneficent and extremely powerful spirit beings --- we will be inherently 'good' from the inside out.
The Wayist worldview, with its understanding of the Butterfly Path, the nature of equality and fairness, and the laws of Karma and Dharma, offers a profound shift in how we perceive and interact with the world. By embracing these concepts, we open ourselves to greater peace, acceptance, resilience, and purpose.
This worldview aligns beautifully with many principles of positive psychology and resilience training. It offers a path to the kind of acceptance, purpose, and growth mindset that psychologists have found to be crucial for mental health and life satisfaction.
As we continue to explore the Wayist path to wholesomeness, we'll see how this worldview informs our understanding of self, shapes our character, and guides our daily practices. Each step of the way, we're building a foundation for a life of true wholeness, happiness, and spiritual fulfillment.
Chapter 3
## The Wayist Concept of Self
Understanding who we truly are, is fundamental to our journey towards wholesomeness and happiness. The Wayist concept of self, offers a profound and multifaceted view of human nature that can revolutionize how we perceive ourselves and our place in the universe. This understanding has far-reaching implications for our mental health, personal growth, and overall well-being.
## We are Hybrid-Soul/Spirit-Beings
In the Wayist view, we are not merely physical beings, nor are we solely spiritual entities. Instead, we are hybrid soul/spirit beings, a unique blend of energies that gives us the potential for extraordinary growth and transformation.
##### **To truly grasp this concept, let's dive deeper**
The soul aspect of our being is what we might call our individual personality. It's the part of us that experiences emotions, forms attachments, and navigates the material world. Our soul carries the imprints of our past experiences, and karmic lessons.
The spirit aspect, on the other hand, is our connection to the divine. It's the part of us that yearns for higher understanding, seeks meaning beyond the material, and has the capacity for unconditional love and wisdom.
As hybrid-beings, we have the unique opportunity to bridge these two realms --- the earthly and the divine.
#### This understanding as hybrid-beings brings several profound benefits
1\. **Enhanced Self-Awareness**\
Recognizing our dual nature allows us to observe our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors from a higher perspective. We can distinguish between our soul's desires and our spirit's aspirations, leading to more conscious decision-making.
2\. **Greater Compassion**\
Understanding that we all share this hybrid nature fosters empathy. We can relate to others' struggles while recognizing their innate capacity for growth and transformation.
3\. **Reduced Identification with Limiting Beliefs**\
When we understand that we're more than just our personalities or our bodies, we're less likely to be trapped by limiting self-concepts. This can significantly reduce anxiety and depression related to negative self-image.
4\. **Motivation for Spiritual Growth**\
Knowing that we have a spiritual aspect encourages us to nurture and develop this part of ourselves, leading to greater peace, wisdom, and fulfillment.
5\. **Resilience in Face of Challenges**\
When we face difficulties, we can draw strength from our spiritual nature, finding resources beyond our usual personality-based coping mechanisms.
To illustrate this concept, consider the analogy of a tree. The roots and trunk, reaching deep into the earth, represent our soul nature --- grounded, individual, shaped by our environment and experiences. The branches and leaves, reaching towards the sky, represent our spirit nature --- aspiring towards the light, ever-growing, connected to the vast expanse above. Together, they form a complete, living entity, capable of weathering storms and bearing fruit.
### The Multiple Minds: Soul-Minds, Spirit-Minds, and Brain-Mind
The Wayist understanding of self goes even deeper, recognizing that we possess multiple 'minds' or centers of consciousness. This concept provides a nuanced framework for understanding our inner workings and can be incredibly empowering in our journey towards wholeness.
#### **Let's explore these minds in more detail**
##### 1. **Soul-Minds**: We have three soul-minds, often associated with the lower chakras in Eastern traditions
-   **Muladhara** (Root Chakra)\
    Related to survival instincts, group-think, tribe, grounding, and hoarding resources, providing basic needs.
-   **Svadhisthana** (Sacral Chakra)\
    Associated with individualism, seeking identity (ego), fluctuating emotions, creativity, and sensuality. These developing emotions and egos are extremely insecure as they are developing into maturity.
-   **Manipura** (Solar Plexus Chakra)\
    Linked to personal power, refinement, self-management, management of others, will to self-improvement, and self-esteem. It is here in Manipura that the identity (ego) comes to its full potential.
##### 2. **Spirit-Minds**: These are associated with the higher chakras
-   **Anahata** (Heart Chakra)\
    The bridge between lower and higher-self, associated with love that transcends what soul-beings can know in their soul-minds, and compassion that transcends what soul beings normally have.
-   **Vishuddhi** (Throat Chakra)\
    The crucible where knowledge and data from experiences are worked to extract wisdom. To express that wisdom in words and articulate higher-self needs comes from this mind.
-   **Ajna** (Third Eye Chakra)\
    Associated with receiving intuition and learning to understand the metaphysical reality in which we venture with our spirit-self.
-   **Sahasrara** (Crown Chakra)\
    Manager of soul evolution, slowly transforming soul-minds into spirit-minds, the direct connection to the Divine of the spirit reality and flows higher-self energies to soul via the Ida and Pingala channels that connect soul and spirit. Associated with spiritual connection and enlightenment.
##### 3. **Brain-Mind and Body-Minds**: We have three minds in this group
-   **Brain mind**\
    Brain mind is our everyday thinking mind, associated with logical reasoning, knowledge, memory, and sensory processing. The soul-minds "speak" through the brain-mind to make the body react to its needs. If the soul's needs are neglected or broken, the soul gets sick and the body will suffer and later get sick. For example, heartbreak, loneliness, depression, or melancholy can in fact cause the death of a person because the body and the brain will wither and die.
-   **Organ group mind**\
    One of the two additional body-mind groups we can call the organ group mind. Each organ has its own set of brain-processing faculties and when they need additional help, they will ask brain-mind to step in and help.
-   **Biome group mind**\
    The biome group mind is also a group-mind, of various species of living beings who co-exist with us in and on this body we use. We need this body as much as they do --- it is our collective body. They help to manufacture dopamine and serotonin, for example, and take care of much of the digestive process. If they die or get sick, the body dies or gets sick.\
    \
    They are groups of organic biome beings who live inside and outside the human body (on our skin, hair, eyelids, etc.), also the internal groups of beings, various species, who exist in the body's digestive tract and organs, sometimes even in the body's blood and cells. Without these beings the human body would not exist.\
    \
    We live in a symbiotic relationship with them. If the soul does not have the compassion for them and neglects their nutritional, habitation, and safety needs, they don't thrive, and the body becomes sick. They do their part to keep the body healthy; the soul must also do its part to deserve the body it needs for this incarnation. The body is jointly owned and inhabited by soul, biome, and spirit.
We exist because of several ecologies, inside us, around us, and energy ecologies for soul and spirit energies.
#### Understanding these multiple minds brings several benefits
1\. **Holistic Self-Understanding**\
We gain a more complete picture of our inner landscape, recognizing that we're more than just our thoughts or emotions.
2\. **Improved Emotional Regulation**\
By understanding which 'mind' is active in different situations, we can better manage our responses and cultivate balance.
3\. **Enhanced Problem-Solving**\
We can approach challenges from multiple perspectives, drawing on different aspects of our being for solutions.
4\. **Greater Inner Harmony**\
By acknowledging and nurturing all aspects of our being, we can achieve a more harmonious internal state.
5\. **Spiritual Growth**\
Understanding our spirit-minds gives us a roadmap for spiritual development, encouraging us to cultivate higher states of consciousness. To bring this concept to life, imagine yourself as a grand orchestra. The soul-minds are the rhythm section, providing the fundamental beat and harmony of your being. The spirit-minds are like the melodic instruments, capable of soaring to unbelievable heights and expressing sublime beauty. The body-minds are the conductor, coordinating the whole ensemble. When all are in harmony, the music of your life becomes a magnificent symphony.
### Developing Authenticity and Owning Your Own Mind
With this rich understanding of our multifaceted nature, we can now explore the importance of authenticity and mental sovereignty key aspects of the Wayist path to wholesomeness.
Authenticity, in the Wayist view, means living in alignment with our true nature as hybrid-soul/spirit-beings. It's about expressing our unique combination of qualities and aspirations, rather than conforming to external expectations or societal norms.
Owning your own mind goes hand in hand with authenticity. It means taking responsibility for your thoughts, beliefs, and actions, rather than allowing them to be dictated by others or by unconscious patterns.
We become immune to blindly following cultural conditioned thinking and popular narratives. We think of ourselves from within out tiny place in the world, recognizing that our value system and lifestyle is not representative of all humans. We always think of ourselves as soul beings in bodies just as are our neighbors, the ants, and trees, flowers, and bees, squirrels and fish. We don't see that our cultural conditioned thinking, politicians, religions, and popular narratives consider the wellbeing of all, and therefore we understand that our rather silent and small voices are unique --- so we allow others to just live the realities they create for themselves. We know what we have is special, and it makes us happy --- but we take cognizance of how junior students create their own realities --- and that is okay. We also did that when we were in their shoes.
#### Here's how cultivating authenticity and owning your mind contributes to wholeness and happiness
1\. **Reduced Inner Conflict**\
When we live authentically, we experience less discord between our inner selves and our outer expression, leading to greater peace and satisfaction.
2\. **Improved Relationships**\
Authentic self-expression fosters deeper, more meaningful connections with others. People are drawn to those who are genuine and self-aware.
3\. **Increased Resilience**\
When we own our minds, we're less swayed by external pressures or negative influences, making us more resilient in the face of life's challenges.
4\. **Enhanced Creativity**\
Authenticity allows our unique gifts and perspectives to shine, often leading to increased creativity and innovation.
5\. **Greater Sense of Purpose**\
Living authentically helps us align with our true path or dharma, leading to a stronger sense of meaning and purpose in life.
6\. **Improved Mental Health**\
Research has shown that authenticity is strongly correlated with various measures of well-being and life satisfaction.
#### To cultivate authenticity and own your mind, consider these practices
-   Regular self-reflection\
    Take time to check in with yourself, exploring your thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
-   Mindfulness meditation\
    This can help you become more aware of your different 'minds' and how they influence you.
-   Conscious decision-making\
    Before acting, pause to consider whether your choices align with your authentic self and higher aspirations.
-   Boundary setting\
    Learn to say no to things that don't align with your values or true self.
-   Continuous learning\
    Regularly expose yourself to new ideas, but always process them through your own understanding rather than accepting them blindly.
Remember, becoming authentic and owning your mind is a journey, not a destination. It's a continual process of self-discovery, adjustment, and growth. As you progress on this path, you'll likely find that your sense of self becomes both stronger and more flexible, anchored in your true nature, yet open to evolution and expansion.
By embracing the Wayist concept of self --- recognizing our hybrid nature, understanding our multiple minds, and cultivating authenticity --- we lay a strong foundation for personal growth, mental health, and spiritual evolution. This multifaceted self-understanding becomes a powerful tool in our quest for true wholesomeness and happiness.
Chapter 4
## The Minds and Their \'Happiness\' Characteristics
As we conclude our exploration of the Wayist concept of self, we find ourselves at the threshold of a deeper understanding. The multiple minds we've discussed --- soul-minds, spirit-minds, and brain-mind --- are not merely abstract concepts, but dynamic centers of consciousness that shape our experience and growth. Intriguingly, modern scientific research has identified key qualities associated with wholesomeness and happiness that align remarkably well with these different aspects of our being.
In the following section, we'll delve into a more detailed examination of these minds and their corresponding characteristics. This framework will serve as a valuable reference point as we progress through the rest of this book, illuminating how Wayist practices and principles nurture specific aspects of our multifaceted selves. By understanding how scientifically recognized traits of well-being correlate with our various minds, we can more effectively cultivate true wholesomeness and happiness.
In the Wayist understanding of self, we recognize that our being is composed of multiple 'minds' or centers of consciousness, each operating in its own unique energy spectrum. Each of these minds plays a crucial role in our overall functioning and contributes uniquely to our self-awareness and personal growth. Interestingly, many of the qualities that modern science has identified as contributing to wholesomeness and happiness align with the domains of these different minds in Wayist philosophy.
Let's explore how these scientifically recognized qualities correspond to each of our minds. It's important to note that the areas of expertise we associate with each mind are not an exhaustive list of their functions, but rather a focused view supporting the thesis of this book --- the correlation between scientifically recognized qualities and where those qualities are developed in our minds.
Remember that Butterfly Path is about evolving the soul. This involves "upgrading" soul-mind qualities to spirit-mind characteristics. For this reason, you'll notice some qualities named in both soul-minds and spirit-minds. We must subject soul-minds to spirit-minds to evolve the soul to its highest spiritual potential.
### Spirituality and Connection with the Divine: Evolving from Religion and Soul-Deities to Mystical Associations and Spirit-Deities
In the journey of spiritual evolution, we observe a profound shift from the worship of soul-deities to a deeper connection with spirit-deities. This transformation represents a significant upgrade in our spiritual understanding and practice.
Soul-deities, often associated with traditional religions, are anthropomorphized beings that reflect human qualities, both virtuous and flawed. These deities are often imagined in human form, complete with human-like emotions and behaviors. They may be depicted as engaging in conflicts with other deities, inciting followers to aggression against non-believers, and promoting tribal or exclusivist ideologies. The worship of soul-deities can sometimes lead to us-versus-them mentalities, potentially fueling division and conflict.
In contrast, spirit-deities represent a more evolved concept of the divine. These beings are characterized by their inherent beneficence and mastery over energy. They possess immense power, yet this power is never used for violence or harm. Spirit-deities respect the law of karma and do not interfere with an individual's karmic journey. Instead, they serve as guides and companions on our spiritual path.
As we progress in our spiritual evolution, we begin to form mystical associations with these spirit-deities. This involves a shift from external worship to internal connection. We learn to walk with our spirit guides on the Butterfly Path, evolving our souls towards a spiritual state. The ultimate goal of this journey is to become one with these beneficent immortals, embodying their qualities of wisdom, helpful loving-kindness, energy work skills, and non-violent beneficence.
This spiritual upgrade represents a move towards a more inclusive, peaceful, and enlightened understanding of the divine. It encourages personal growth, harmony with others, and a deeper connection with the universal consciousness. By aligning ourselves with spirit-deities, we cultivate a spirituality that is both deeply personal and universally connected, fostering wholeness and true happiness.
The scientifically understood qualities of "happy people" are now listed, alongside the mind that specialize in that skill.
## Sahasrara (Crown Chakra)
-   Energy ecology -- sensitive to social intelligence, living in harmony with others and beings in nature, knowing otherwise unobserved realities of others
-   Sense of spiritual purpose of life (reprogramming the lower two chakras, upgrading from religion)
## Ajna (Third Eye Chakra, spirit-mind)
-   Spirituality and direct connection with the Divine and the spirit realm
-   Awe
-   Energy hygiene
-   Empathy
-   Prayer and connection with a Divine Tara
-   Higher-self energy work at a high level
## Vishuddhi (Throat Chakra, spirit-mind)

## Anahata (Heart Chakra, bridge between soul and spirit, higher-self)
-   Courage -- we learn self-sacrificing altruism, a quality only the kindest and most evolved of animals display
-   Humanity -- we learn to transcend tribe, ethnicity, and type
-   Love -- we learn of different kinds of love beyond what soul-people and other animals naturally have
-   Social Intelligence -- starting with loving-kindness and acceptance, we become more intelligent
-   Beauty -- we are free to admire the beauties in nature, people, and life
-   Gratitude -- this is the higher-self version of gratitude that is prevalent in Muladhara
-   Self-Acceptance -- we actually do like ourselves
-   Benign humor
## Manipura (Solar Plexus Chakra, soul-mind, lower-self):
-   Love of knowledge, inquisitiveness, and curiosity
-   Persistence
-   Appreciation of beauty and excellence
-   Leadership
-   Self-regulation
-   Udbhu-kanti (contentment with simplicity)
-   Meditation
-   Lower-self energy work
-   Ego comes into full potential
-   Self-respect and self-worth
-   Self-reflection and personal growth (upgrade to spiritual one day, via Vishuddhi)
-   Sense of meaning and clarity of direction (upgrade to spiritual one day, via Vishuddhi)
## Svadhisthana (Sacral Chakra, soul-mind, lower-self)
-   Zest for Life
-   Playfulness (not video games or watching sport, those are anti-playfulness)
-   Emotional liberation (severing energy bonds; also known as forgiveness in the West)
-   Joy is essential -- soul-like joy upgrades to higher-self values
-   Sense of purpose (self-sense, spiritual upgrade via Sahasrara)
-   Open-mindedness and perspective (spiritual upgrade via Vishuddhi)
-   When religious, soul-people identify through this ego-mind. When spiritual, spirit-people develop a spiritual identity and sense of purpose and belonging through this spirit-ego.
## Muladhara (Root Chakra, soul-mind, lower-self)
-   Bravery
-   Hope
-   Sense of purpose, foundation
-   Resilience
-   Belonging: Race, tribe, nationality, ethnicity and organized religion with tribalistic soul-type deities. Or for spirit-people, understanding oneself as becoming a family member of a higher class of being, and all humans are on that Path in this school (some will graduate, others will choose to not graduate)
## Brain-mind (body-mind)
-   When empowered by other minds, this mind computes probabilities and is therefore a crucial partner in critical thinking, and self-awareness, and crunching data from sensory observations in every-day life.
-   The human complex can usually remain alive with this brain incapacitated (coma, sleep, dementia, etc.) but for our soul-spirit self, the conditions of living the human experience are less than ideal. Often, we just go along to Paradise to await a new incarnation.
## Organs-mind (body-mind, group-mind of organs)
-   Organs react to different higher-self stressors. For example, lovesickness and melancholy can, in fact, be lethal for the organic body.
-   Dharmic dissonance happens when a person goes against its own principles. It is a Vishuddhi-mind stressor. It affects several organs and the cycle of sickness starts from there. It shows on the skin, scalp, and postural framework. If chronic, it can lead to depleted immune system and chronic ailments.
## Microbiome-mind (body-mind, group mind of external and internal microbiome)
-   Triggers and precursors of several "happiness hormones". Hypersensitive and responsive to spirit-minds stressors.
-   Digestive mind, and nutrient conversion. Hypersensitive to soul-minds and organ-minds stressors.
-   Consider what happens when toxic food intake (hangover, bad fish tacos, other toxins) trigger the microbiome-mind. The brain, lower-self and higher-self, all become incapacitated. Consider for example, what happens when eczema or neuropathy covers just one organ, the skin. The entire human complex, including intelligence of the brain, must take a back seat or shut down. While philosophers and psychologists talk lofty ideals about wholesomeness and brain-mind superiority and happiness, truth is, when the microbiome-mind is unhappy, nobody shall be happy. It can bring about insanity as easy as it can bring happiness and contentment.
This framework provides a comprehensive map of our inner landscape, illustrating how different aspects of our being contribute to our overall wholesomeness and happiness. It's important to note that while each mind has its primary functions, they all work in harmony, supporting and influencing each other.
#### By cultivating awareness of these different minds and their characteristics, we can
1\. Identify areas of strength and potential growth in our personal development.
2\. Understand the source of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors more clearly.
3\. Develop a more balanced approach to self-improvement, ensuring we're not neglecting any crucial aspects of our being.
4\. Appreciate the complexity of our inner world and the interconnectedness of our various aspects.
5\. Tailor our spiritual practices to address specific areas we wish to develop or balance.
As we progress on our Wayist journey, this understanding of our multiple minds serves as a valuable tool for deepening our self-awareness and guiding our personal growth.
It reminds us that we are multifaceted beings, capable of great depth and complexity, and that true wholesomeness comes from nurturing and harmonizing all aspects of our self.
## Part II: Cultivating Wayist Virtues and Character
Chapter 5
## Wisdom and Knowledge
We've all heard the saying "knowledge is power," but in Wayism, we take it a step further. We believe that wisdom and knowledge are essential ingredients for a fulfilling, wholesome life. But we're not just talking about book smarts here.
For as long as history is old, individuals with power and the desire to manipulate people, controlled the flow of information and knowledge. Their strategy involved taking control of news outlets, shaping messages, shaping historical accounts, and influencing educational materials to advance their goals. Throughout history, those in power have relied on fake news, disinformation, and suppressing dissenting voices to maintain control and benefit themselves.
Understanding this as an intrinsic aspect of existence, the Wayist consistently seeks to authenticate information by seeking input from diverse sources. Picture this: you stumble upon an intriguing story, but upon further investigation, you realize it stems from a well-known gossipmonger, a doctor with an interest in the pharmacy, or politician, in the area. If such a scenario arises, it is prudent to gather information from alternative sources before forming any beliefs about the story.
We're diving into a deeper understanding of knowledge and wisdom, which can transform how you view the world and your place in it.
### Personal Life Philosophy with Ontological Understanding
Science knows that people with a personal life philosophy and ontological understanding tend to be happier, more wholesome, and healthier. Over past millennia, most people held their life philosophies and traditional ontological understandings that sustained them. But modern western life had been under attack by forces who sell corporately motivated political and chemical solutions to unhappy and weak people.
Over several generations, the average westerner was alienated from self and ancient wisdom, and were indoctrinated to adopt a personal life philosophy rooted in unsustainable sickness and weakness: individualism, skepticism, selfishness, anti-family, anti-parenting, anti-common-sense, anti-spiritual, nihilism (nothing actually exists, existence or values are meaningless. Relentless negativity suggesting an absence of values or beliefs).
While parading as human rights, they deteriorated the quality of life of the most vulnerable in society. They broke down the values of gender relations and family, ancient human values, and medicines, and societal systems that used to sustain people.
They created a population of individuals marked by loneliness, neuroses, fearsome, enraged, mentally ill, distrust, and physically illness; an insatiable consumer prepared to work itself to death and die unenlightened after a meaningless life. Science agrees, one must have a wholesome personal life philosophy to one day discover what happiness and wholesomeness are.
You may decide to allow this book to help you develop your personal life philosophy while reading about the qualities humans need to become happy and wholesome. But, don't worry --- this isn't about becoming the next great philosopher. It's about understanding the nature of being and existence in a way that makes sense to you.
Think of it like this: If your life were a ship, your personal philosophy would be the explicit purpose of the trip, the compass, shipping route, and maps guiding you through both calm and stormy weather. Your personal life philosophy helps you answer the big questions: Who am I? What's the nature of reality? Why am I here? Where am I going after this? What's my purpose?
A good book to read to help you form a comprehensive personal life philosophy is "theWAY of the Heart Mind".
#### Here's how developing this philosophy can benefit you, according to modern science
1\. **Clarity and Direction**\
When you have a clear philosophy, making decisions becomes easier. It's like having a personal GPS for life's journey.
2\. **Resilience**\
Understanding the deeper nature of reality helps you handle life's challenges better. You can see beyond immediate difficulties to the bigger picture.
3\. **Sense of Meaning**\
This understanding provides a framework for finding meaning in all experiences, both positive and negative. And guess what? Research shows that a sense of meaning is strongly linked to life satisfaction and mental health.
Reading Wayism is one way to begin developing your personal philosophy. You have arrived at this point where the universe brought you face to face with it because you have lived, tried and tested what your culture and society wanted for you.
#### To continue on the path with Wayism as your foundation, vehicle, and measuring tape, try these
-   Spend some time journaling about life's big questions.
-   Read about different philosophical and spiritual traditions --- not to adopt them wholesale, but to inform your own thinking. When in discussion, your view will not only be from an informed viewpoint, it will also be with respect.
-   Have deep discussions with others about the nature of reality and existence. Not to convince them or win an argument, but to learn about life as others view it. Typically, you cannot change a person's belief system, its like the other religions, climate change, and sometimes even the popular narrative of the day.\
    Attacking someone's belief system with evidence to the contrary is always received with deep emotions and they will lash out and destroy you for it.
-   Observe how your beliefs shape your life experiences.
Remember, your personal philosophy isn't set in stone. It should evolve as you grow and gain new insights. Even rereading a sentence in a Wayist book, years from now, can reveal deeper layers of wisdom.\
We learn at our own pace. We can only grasp the wisdom for which we were prepared. If you 'get' this book, it is because of exactly that --- it was years in the making.
### Critical Thinking and Discernment
Scientists are telling people: to be happy, you need critical thinking skills. The dictum, "Own Your Own Mind," has been a Wayist teaching for nearly 3,500 years that we know of. In today's world of information overload, and the proliferation of manipulative information being forced upon people, being able to think critically and discern truth from falsehood is more crucial than ever. But in Wayism, critical thinking isn't about being cynical --- it's about approaching life with a clear, questioning mind.
#### Here's what science says why it's so important
1\. **Protection from Manipulation**\
Sharp critical thinking skills make you less susceptible to manipulation by politicians, corporations, and corporate owned control bodies, media, advertising, or misleading ideologies. It's like having a built-in fact-checker.
2\. **Better Decision Making**\
When you can analyze situations effectively, you make better choices in all areas of life. This can seriously reduce stress and increase life satisfaction.
3\. **Intellectual Humility**\
True critical thinking involves recognizing the limitations of your own knowledge. This humility can lead to better relationships and a more peaceful mindset. This also involves knowing how insignificant the human species and its brain is in the Universal sense.
4\. **Don't sweat the nonsense**\
Critical thinking helps you to recognize when something is worth your emotional investment or not. Some long-coming movements are bigger than you. You may recognize how democracy is like WWE entertainment: its been bought, its owned and presented to you like the ancient Roman circus.\
People speak of "two wings of the same bird" because forces other than the bird controls things and the wings are there to make us believe we had a choice in the outcome. You may recognize how the powers that be use your money and your children to inflict untold sorrow, death, and hardship on others for the benefit of a few individuals, many of whom don't even live in your country. You may recognise how there are world orders and every country in the world is but another pion in the big chess game of world orders. These are the games that soul-people play and have been playing for as long as humanity is old.
You must choose to either toxify your life and mind and fret about the injustice of it, then die unhappy, or get out there and have a beautiful life irrespective of what they are doing to the world. This campus, this school of divinity for souls, is overrun by junior students, soul-people. And they will never be any different. They have the majority vote in everything because they are the majority of people on campus.
Like a looming WW3 or cultural genocide in full swing, fifty years in the making --- you can't do much except vote in a rigged election, but you can decide not to sweat the nonsense and enjoy every moment you can with nature, living beings, being kind, have joy and awe, and love your loved ones while you still can --- and when your time comes to depart this body, you go with peace in your heart, better off than when you incarnated to Earth some years ago. And when you come back, you are ahead of the game and won't be caught up in it.
You can choose to embrace different values and not be so much of a puppet in their machinations.
#### To sharpen your critical thinking skills
-   Practice questioning your own assumptions and beliefs. Ask yourself, "Why do I believe this?" "How many institutions conspired to tell me what I must believe --- why --- what it to them?"
-   Seek out diverse viewpoints on important issues. Try to understand perspectives different from your own.
-   Learn about common logical fallacies and how to avoid them.
-   Develop the habit of fact-checking before accepting information as true.
### Love of Learning and Curiosity
In Wayism, we believe that life is a continuous journey of growth and discovery. We came here to evolve our mortal souls into immortal spirits. And wisdom that becomes a spiritual skill, is how it happens. The beginning of wisdom is self-knowledge. Cultivating a love of learning and maintaining a curious mindset are key to this journey.
Think of curiosity as the spark that lights up your world, making even ordinary experiences extraordinary.
#### Here's why modern science says curiosity is so powerful
1\. **Mental Stimulation**\
Continuous learning keeps your mind active and engaged. It's like a workout for your brain, helping to keep it healthy as you age.
2\. **Increased Adaptability**\
In our rapidly changing world, those who love to learn are better equipped to adapt to new situations. This can seriously reduce stress and anxiety about change.
3\. **Enhanced Creativity**\
Curiosity often leads to creative insights as you make connections between diverse areas of knowledge.
4\. **Greater Life Satisfaction**\
The process of learning and discovery can be deeply fulfilling, contributing to a sense of purpose and engagement with life.
#### To nurture your love of learning and curiosity
-   Make time to explore topics that interest you, even if they're not directly related to your work or daily life.
-   Practice mindfulness to become more aware of the world around you. There's wonder in even the most ordinary things if you look closely.
-   Ask questions and seek to understand the 'why' and 'how' behind things. How do they make this? Especially living things and nature --- there is a fascinating universe hidden from the minds of the average person.
-   Embrace new experiences and step out of your comfort zone regularly. Not only things different to your normal, but things that make you feel uncomfortable --- that is the meaning of getting out of your comfort zone --- the cocoon that keeps you uninformed and vulnerable. Foods. If others eat it, so can you. Like with the opinions of others, if you don't like it, spit it out and move on to the next dish.
### Open-mindedness and Perspective
Being open-minded is about being willing to consider new ideas and perspectives, even when they challenge your existing beliefs. If you don't like it after tasting it in your mind, spit it out and move on to the next dish --- been there, done that. It's a quality that's essential for personal growth and for navigating our diverse and complex world. For the Wayist, it's a quality that is central to evolving the soul.
#### Here's why science says open-mindedness is so valuable
1\. **Reduced Conflict**\
Being open to allow others' viewpoints to exist can significantly reduce interpersonal conflicts and improve relationships.
2\. **Enhanced Problem-Solving**\
Considering multiple perspectives often leads to more creative and effective solutions to problems.
3\. **Personal Growth**\
Open-mindedness allows you to learn from a wider range of experiences and viewpoints, accelerating your personal development.
4\. **Increased Empathy**\
Understanding different perspectives naturally increases your ability to empathize with others, leading to more fulfilling relationships.
#### To cultivate open-mindedness
-   Actively seek out viewpoints that differ from your own. Read books, articles or listen to podcasts by people you disagree with.
-   Practice suspending judgment and really listening to others, even when their views challenge yours.
-   Challenge your own beliefs regularly. Ask yourself, "What if I'm wrong about this?" When it comes to your Wayism vs. something else, ask, "Have I found something that is better all round?" If you believe you have found a better alternative, then that may be a path you need to go down, even if it leads into a swamp. If Wayism is what your soul really needs, then Karma and your guardian deity will, over time, guide you back to this Path. Ask Rumi, Kabir, the Bhagavad Gita, Lalleshwari, Janabai, Lord Jesus, and Bodhidarma --- it's true, all people are led back to this Path when they mature into it.
-   Travel and expose yourself to different cultures when possible. Listen and observe without your confirmation bias. If travel isn't an option, explore different cultures by meeting people of other cultures in your own town, or through books, films, or local cultural events.
By cultivating these aspects of wisdom and knowledge --- a personal life philosophy, critical thinking, love of learning, and open-mindedness --- we create a solid foundation for a life of wholeness and happiness. These qualities enable us to navigate life's complexities with grace, to find meaning in our experiences, and to continually grow and evolve.
As we progress on the Wayist path, these virtues become not just intellectual concepts, but lived realities that infuse every aspect of our being. They shape how we perceive the world, how we interact with others, and how we understand ourselves. In doing so, they contribute immeasurably to our sense of purpose, our resilience in the face of challenges, and our overall well-being and happiness.
We become humble in knowledge; we start to know what we don't know --- and that is the foundation of true wisdom. This too is why no one should change or "adapt" Wayist philosophy to suit their present needs and ideas. It's an ancient philosophy that survived the world and was preserved for us for more than 5,000 years already. Anyone who wants to change it must be wiser than Wayism itself, more than 5,000 years of esoteric wisdom. Meaning --- it is deeper and more thorough than you can now understand. Give your soul and spirit time to work with it and use it as foundation whenever you seek and gain other knowledge, then test them against what you have. That is the Path.
Chapter 6
## Courage and Humanity
When you hear the word "courage," what comes to mind? Maybe you think of a firefighter rushing into a burning building, or someone standing up to injustice. These are certainly acts of courage, but in Wayism, we see courage in a broader, more everyday light. And when we pair courage with humanity, we create a powerful formula for living a wholesome, fulfilling life.
## Bravery, Persistence, and Zest for Life
In Wayism, courage isn't just about facing physical danger. It's about facing our inner demons, overcoming the cultural conditioning of your mind and soul, persisting in our spiritual growth, and maintaining enthusiasm for life, even when things get tough.
### **1. Bravery**
Bravery, in the Wayist sense, is about facing our fears and vulnerabilities with an open heart. It's having the guts to be authentically you.
The brave soldier is not the one who has no fear or is so arrogant they don't understand the danger. No. No soldier or firefighter wants to be near one of those people. The brave soldier pees himself in fear, yet overcomes the paralysis of it and presses on to do what is right and correct in that situation.
Think about it: Have you ever wanted to speak up in a meeting but held back out of fear? Or you wanted to put up your hand but didn't because you don't want to be seen as the odd one out --- you value group conformity more than what is right? Or maybe you've dreamed of pursuing a passion but were too scared to take the first step. That's where Wayist bravery comes in.
Do you know about the many, many, psychological tests done that prove only 15% of people have what it takes to go against group consensus even when the group is wrong? More than 75% of people blindly follow the popular narrative, and even when presented with hard evidence it is considered incorrect or labelled as conspiracy theory, they won't go against the group-mind. It hurts them so badly, they insult you, yell, and attack your person (hair, makeup, penis size, etc.), they experience emotional meltdowns because they feel anxiety for being trapped in the group mind, they need that ideology to give meaning to their lives.
The Wayist refuses. We understand the group is made up of a majority of soul-people, and we are different. So, we have no problem to be different and disagreeing with popular narratives. In fact, when we do agree...we worry...and double check.
#### **Here's how cultivating bravery can change your life**
**Increased Self-Confidence**\
Each time you face a fear, you build confidence in your ability to handle challenges. It's like working out a muscle --- the more you use it, the stronger it gets.
**Expanded Opportunities**\
When you're brave enough to say "yes" to new experiences, you open doors to enriching opportunities you might have otherwise missed.
**Authenticity**\
Being brave allows you to be true to yourself, even when it's difficult. And authenticity is the bedrock of meaningful relationships and personal fulfillment.
**Try this**\
Start small. Maybe it's speaking up in that meeting or signing up for that class you've always wanted to take. Celebrate each brave act, no matter how small it might seem.
### **2. Persistence**
Persistence is about keeping going, even when the going gets tough. It's a crucial quality for spiritual growth and personal development.
#### Here's why persistence is so powerful
**Goal Achievement**\
Often, persistence is the deciding factor in reaching our goals. It's not always the most talented who succeed, but the most persistent.
**Resilience**\
The habit of persisting builds emotional and mental resilience. You learn that setbacks are just part of the journey, not the end of it.
**Self-Respect**\
Knowing you have the ability to persist increases your self-respect and self-worth. You become someone you can count on.
#### To build persistence
-   Break large goals into smaller, manageable steps. Celebrate each small victory along the way.
-   Develop a growth mindset that sees challenges as opportunities to learn and grow.
-   Remember past successes when you're facing difficulties. You've persisted before; you can do it again.
### **3. Zest for Life**
Zest is about approaching life with enthusiasm, energy, and excitement. It's about fully engaging with life, rather than just going through the motions.
#### The benefits of cultivating zest are numerous
**Increased Happiness**\
People with zest for life consistently report higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction.
**Better Physical Health**\
Zest is associated with better overall health outcomes. It's like your enthusiasm for life actually boosts your immune system!
**Stronger Relationships**\
Enthusiasm is contagious. When you approach life with zest, you naturally draw others of similar energy to you, strengthening your relationships with like energies.
#### To cultivate zest
-   Practice gratitude daily. Start or end each day by noting three things you're grateful for. Add to your list, and soon it will be so long you cannot say thank you for all that you are grateful for.
-   Engage in activities that bring you joy and excitement. Make time for play! Be aware of the less than wholesome, now well documented and well-founded dangers associated with online play.
-   Surround yourself with positive, enthusiastic people. Their energy will rub off on you.
## Kindness, Love, and Social Intelligence
These qualities form the core of our humanity. They're essential for creating meaningful connections and contributing positively to the world around us.
### **1. Kindness**
In Wayism, kindness goes beyond mere politeness. It's an active practice of compassion and consideration for all beings. Our ancient tradition inherited the Koine Greek term, chrestotes, and that is how we understand kindness.
Chrestotes means, the wisdom to know when, and what, would be the most appropriate help to give in a particular situation. It is a spiritual skill developed over lifetimes. In short, we refer to it as 'helpful loving-kindness'.
We are aware that certain chemicals that some people are exposed to destroy the energy connection between higher-self and brain, thereby making spirituality difficult if not impossible for some.
#### The benefits of practicing helpful loving-kindness are profound
**Improved Mental Health**\
Acts of kindness release feel-good hormones like oxytocin and serotonin. It's a natural mood booster!
**Stronger Relationships**\
Kindness fosters trust and reciprocity in relationships. It's the glue that holds communities together.
**Sense of Purpose**\
Regular acts of kindness can provide a deep sense of meaning and purpose. It connects you to something larger than yourself.
#### To practice kindness
-   Perform random acts of kindness regularly. It could be as simple as acknowledging someone who is typically not acknowledged, holding the door for someone, cleaning up when it's not expected of you, or offering a genuine compliment --- all without expecting something in return. Even when some people abuse the situation, we are undeterred --- there will always be junior students like them in the School.
-   Practice self-kindness through positive self-talk and self-care. Your physical and energy hygiene practices and habits are part of this, so are your diet and other lifestyle habits. Remember, kindness starts with how you treat yourself.
-   Another part of self-kindness is to know your enemy and to never disregard them. Who are your enemies? They who want to own your mind are your enemies, and so are they who want to stop your spirituality and thinking clearly, and so are the chemicals in produce that make you sick, and so too are they who are doing social engineering and cultural genocide, and so too are they who don't want to see you succeed. It's as simple as staying away from them and not making yourself vulnerable to them. Don't tell them much about yourself. Don't share your successes or your plans. Read SunTzu's ancient book, The Art of War. Self-kindness is to remove obvious obstacles from your life.
-   Cultivate empathy by trying to understand others' perspectives. Put yourself in their shoes before judging. Consider the lives of the many, many, species who are forced to live on this planet sharing space with humans --- humans who have no regard for others. They need healthy soil and water, space to hunt and breed and raise their young, yet the human believes it "owns" the land and destroys the habitat of others. We are waging a genocidal war against them. Be aware of them. They don't deserve your kindness because they don't have to do something to deserve it --- it's more like we humans don't deserve Earth.
### **2. Love**
In Wayism, love isn't just a feeling but a way of being. It encompasses self-love, love for others, and a universal love for all existence.
#### Here's how cultivating love can transform your life
**Emotional Well-being**\
Love, or people who love, are associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression, and more balanced mental health. It's like a shield against negative emotions.
**Physical Health**\
Love and affection are linked to better cardiovascular health. Your heart literally benefits from love! Affection from a loved one is healing, and it strengthens your immune system and makes you more compassionate, gives you zest for life, and makes you more successful in most endeavors.
**Life Satisfaction**\
People who report feeling more love also report higher life satisfaction. Love makes life richer and more meaningful.
#### To cultivate love
-   Practice loving-kindness meditation. Send thoughts of love and well-wishes to yourself, loved ones, neutral people, difficult people, and all beings.
-   Express appreciation and affection to loved ones regularly. Don't take them for granted.
-   Extend feelings of goodwill to all beings, including those you find challenging. This doesn't mean you have to like everyone, but you can wish them well. You can even wish they would just f\*&k-off and go be well somewhere far away from you.
### **3. Social Intelligence**
Social intelligence is about navigating social situations with wisdom and empathy. It is a skill we develop from continuous observation, taking notes how people react to social ques and what makes people tick. This intelligence typically comes from keen observation.
Crows, and pets, for example, do it, and develop the wisdom to know how to manipulate animals or people to form a symbiotic relationship. Babies learn 90% of what they must know from keen observation of the parents.
Watch people and learn from the evidence unsullied by group-mind and popular narrative thinking.
Social intelligence is crucial for building and maintaining healthy relationships.
#### The benefits of social intelligence include
**Better Relationships**\
Understanding social dynamics leads to smoother, more fulfilling relationships.
**Career Success**\
Social intelligence is often key to professional advancement. It helps you work well with others and lead effectively.
**Reduced Stress**\
Being able to navigate social situations reduces social anxiety and stress.
#### To develop social intelligence
-   Practice active listening. Really focus on understanding others, not just waiting for your turn to speak. Observe if they are trying to manipulate their audience, or if there is a difference in what they tell people and how they act. As yourself, what motivates them to speak and act as they do? These are not judgements, just more notes for learning social intelligence.
-   Learn to read non-verbal cues. Much of communication is non-verbal.
-   Develop empathy through perspective-taking exercises. Try to see situations from others' points of view. Ask yourself, how would a person with a right-wing mindset translate this? How would a person with a Climate Change mindset translate this, and how would a person from Singapore, China, or Mexico translate this same scenario?
By cultivating these aspects of courage and humanity --- bravery, persistence, zest for life, kindness, love, and social intelligence --- we create a life rich in meaning and connection. These qualities enable us to face life's challenges with grace, to form deep and satisfying relationships, and to contribute positively to the world around us.
Remember, developing these qualities is a lifelong journey. In fact, a lives-long journey --- it takes several lifetimes to become truly wise in this. At the root of this learning is positive regard for others, allowing them to believe what they believe, and your own self-respect to anchor who you know yourself to be.
Be patient with yourself, celebrate small progress, and keep in mind that every step towards greater courage and humanity is a step towards a more wholesome and joyful life.
As we move forward, we'll explore how these qualities of courage and humanity interact with other virtues to create a truly balanced and fulfilling life. Are you ready to discover how justice and temperance can further enrich your journey? Let's dive into the next chapter!

## Transformative Struggle
In the journey toward wholesomeness, few concepts are as powerful and transformative as the Wayist understanding of struggle. While many philosophies position struggle as something to avoid or overcome, Wayism recognizes it as an essential catalyst for evolution in all dimensions of existence.
##  Understanding Transformative Struggle
 Life inherently involves conflict and challenge. From the seed breaking its shell to grow, to the immune system battling pathogens, to societies working out their differences --- struggle is woven into the very fabric of existence. The key distinction lies not in the presence or absence of struggle, but in how we engage with it.
 Transformative struggle represents the conscious engagement with life\'s inherent conflicts in service of higher development and spiritual growth. Unlike destructive conflict, which seeks to dominate or destroy, transformative struggle operates through wisdom rather than force, addressing root causes rather than symptoms.
###  **Consider these natural examples**
-   The butterfly must struggle to emerge from its chrysalis --- this struggle is essential for strengthening its wings
-   It is necessary for muscles to be stressed to grow stronger
-   Learning requires pushing beyond our comfort zone
-   Relationships deepen through working through difficulties together
 The Wisdom of Choosing Our Struggles
 In Wayism, we understand that the question is not whether to struggle, but how to struggle wisely. As conscious beings, we must \"pick our battles\" with discernment, choosing to engage in those conflicts that serve life\'s true purpose: the evolution of consciousness and the manifestation of higher wisdom.
###  **This involves recognizing**
-   Which struggles serve our spiritual growth
-   Which battles are worth engaging
-   When to transform rather than oppose
-   How to build rather than break
-   Where to heal rather than wound
###  Practical Application
####  Personal Level
#####  **When facing challenges, ask yourself**
-   Does this struggle serve my spiritual evolution?
-   Am I engaging this difficulty with wisdom or reaction?
-   What can I learn from this situation?
-   How can I transform rather than merely oppose?
####  Family Life
#####  **Parents can help children understand**
-   Not all struggles are negative
-   Difficulties can be opportunities for growth
-   How to choose which challenges to engage
-   The difference between transformative and destructive approaches
####  Community Level
#####  **In our communities, we can**
-   Build new structures while old ones decay
-   Create alternatives rather than merely oppose what doesn\'t work
-   Transform systemic weaknesses through wisdom
-   Address root causes rather than just symptoms
####  Social Response
#####  **When facing social challenges**
-   Don\'t fight media control; build community connection
-   Don\'t battle corruption; strengthen personal integrity
-   Don\'t attack power structures; empower individuals
-   Don\'t fight manipulation; develop discernment
###  The Nature of Victory
####  **In transformative struggle, victory takes different forms**
-   Not domination but transformation
-   Not destruction but renewal
-   Not revenge but evolution
-   Not control but liberation
-   Not subjugation but awakening
####  Living Transformative Struggle
#####  *Maria\'s Story*
*\"When my company downsized, I initially felt victimized. But then I realized this was an opportunity for transformation. Instead of fighting against the change, I used it as a catalyst to start the business I\'d always dreamed of. The struggle wasn\'t about winning against my former employer - it was about evolving into who I needed to become.\"*
#####  *James\'s Experience*
*\"In my marriage, we hit a point of serious conflict. Rather than trying to \'win\' arguments, we learned to see our struggles as opportunities to understand each other better. Every difficulty became a chance to grow closer, to transform our relationship into something stronger.\"*
##  Benefits of Understanding Transformative Struggle
 **Enhanced Resilience**\
When we see struggles as opportunities for growth, we develop greater emotional and spiritual resilience.
 **Clearer Purpose**\
Understanding the transformative nature of struggle helps us engage life\'s challenges with meaning and direction.
**Better Relationships**\
This approach helps us navigate conflicts in ways that strengthen rather than damage relationships.
 **Spiritual Growth**\
Conscious engagement with struggle accelerates our spiritual evolution.
###  Remember
-    Not all conflicts need to be engaged
-   Choose battles that serve higher development
-   Transform rather than destroy
-   Build while others break
-   Heal while others wound
-   Create while others oppose
 In embracing transformative struggle, we align ourselves with the evolutionary impulse of life itself. We become conscious participants in our own development, using life\'s inevitable challenges as catalysts for growth and transformation.
 This understanding brings peace even amid difficulty, purpose even in pain, and clarity even in confusion. It transforms us from victims of circumstance into conscious creators of our destiny, from reactors to transformers.
 As you continue your journey on the Wayist path, let this understanding of transformative struggle guide how you engage with life\'s challenges. The goal isn\'t to avoid struggle but to struggle wisely, not to escape conflict but to transform through it, not to merely survive but to evolve.
Chapter 8
## Transcendence
Transcendence is another of the qualities that science now specifies as a common trait among the happiest and most well people in the western world. When we talk about transcendence in Wayism, we're referring to the ability to connect with something greater than ourselves, and that is also how the scientists describe it.
This doesn't necessarily mean only something supernatural. It can be feeling connected to nature, to humanity as a whole, or to a sense of meaning that goes beyond our day-to-day concerns. Cultivating transcendence can bring a profound sense of peace, purpose, and joy to our lives. Let's explore some key aspects of transcendence and how they contribute to our overall well-being.
## Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence
This aspect of transcendence is about noticing and savoring the beauty and excellence around us, whether it's in nature, art, or human achievement.
The feeling of awe, which comes from understanding the immensity of nature and its mind-boggling mechanisms, intelligence, consciousness, design, and all the amazingly intelligent beings in the universe all around us.
Wayism teaches that the feeling of awe is an opening of the higher-self and a step toward deeper spirituality. Do keep in mind that for the Wayist, the ultimate beauty lies in the authenticity of that which we behold as beautiful. No external popular-narrative measure defines beauty for us; authenticity is the greater measure of beauty.
### Benefits of appreciating beauty and excellence
**Increased Positive Emotions**\
Taking time to notice beauty can boost feelings of joy, awe, groundedness, belonging, and gratitude.
**Stress Reduction**\
Focusing on authentic beauty can provide a mental break from our worries and stressors.
**Inspiration**\
Recognizing excellence in others can motivate us to strive for our own personal growth.
### Practical ways to cultivate this appreciation
-   Take a "beauty walk" where you intentionally look for beautiful things in your environment. Allow yourself to be in awe of the small wonders under your feet, or the majesty of the skies.
-   Keep an "in awe journal" where you record moments of beauty or excellence or awe you encounter each day.
-   Visit art galleries, attend concerts, or watch documentaries about remarkable human achievements. It's fun to learn how art in galleries are not always placed because of its beauty, but often because of graft, politics, and market manipulation. If you don't find the piece to have authentical beauty, then it is not beautiful for you, no matter what another person says. That, in itself, is a beautiful thing --- that we don't have a narrow band definition of beauty. Our honesty comes into play, in knowing what we truly find beautiful, and that is good soul food.
-   Spend time in nature, even if it's just sitting in a local park for a few minutes. Sit, and feel the energies beneath the soil, the roots of trees stretching out thirty feet from the tree and the mycelium down there, and all the activity in the soil. Observe, just sit and observe, and become one with the energy ecology of authentic life on Earth.
Remember, beauty isn't just about visual aesthetics. It could be a kind act you witness, a laugh, the taste of a sun-ripened fruit, a simple yet deliciously hearty meal, or a well-crafted story. Excellence might be a colleague's presentation at work, an athlete's performance, or a child learning to tie their shoes. The key is to pause and notice these moments, drink it in, feed your spirit, and make memories with your heart.
## Gratitude and Hope
Gratitude and hope are powerful forces that can significantly impact our mental and emotional well-being. They're about appreciating what we have now and maintaining a positive outlook for the future.
### **1. Gratitude**
Gratitude transcends the simple act of saying "thank you." It's a profound appreciation for the myriad blessings in our lives, from the monumental to the minute.
In today's world, we often encounter an epidemic of ingratitude. Those afflicted by this mindset struggle to find happiness, blind to the abundance surrounding them. They may feel entitled to what they possess, yet paradoxically remain unaware of their true wealth. Their discontent stems from an insatiable desire for more, often fixating on unrealistic aspirations like instant wealth without understanding the complexities and challenges involved in achieving such goals.
This mentality can lead to misguided criticisms of successful individuals, failing to recognize the years of struggle, risk, and sacrifice that often precede significant achievements. It's a perspective that can trap one in a cycle of dissatisfaction and unrealized potential.
Cultivating gratitude, however, can be transformative. It begins with acknowledging the often-overlooked essentials that make life not just possible, but comfortable. From basic bodily functions to modern conveniences, there's an abundance to appreciate.
#### Cultivate gratitude and consider
-   **Physical blessings**\
    Functional limbs, sensory organs, and bodily systems that work seamlessly.
-   **Modern comforts**\
    Access to modern healthcare, clean water, sanitation in the home, electricity, and technology.
-   **Personal capabilities**\
    The ability to read, write, think critically, and learn.
-   **Societal advantages**\
    Being born in and living in a country with opportunities and freedoms.
By regularly practicing gratitude, perhaps through keeping a journal, we can shift our perspective dramatically. Life becomes richer, more meaningful, and indeed, amazing. We learn to value what we have rather than lamenting what we lack.
Moreover, gratitude fosters a realistic appreciation of our circumstances. It helps us recognize the opportunities available to us, whether it's the ability to offer our skills (which, for some people, are not much more than just labor) in the job market or the existence of systems that allow for personal and professional growth.
In essence, gratitude is a powerful tool for personal transformation. It opens our eyes to the wealth of blessings we often take for granted, fostering contentment, resilience, and a more positive outlook on life.
Once we embrace gratitude and udbhu-kanti, we find ourselves embroiled in another world of possibilities so vast and full of opportunities for earning, for mental and soul and spiritual wealth.
#### Benefits of practicing gratitude
**Improved Mental Health**\
Regular gratitude practice is linked to lower rates of depression and anxiety, higher savings, and ability to retire or weather a catastrophe, and more peace of mind.
**Better Sleep**\
People who report sleeping well also report being Grateful, there is a strong correlation, and sleeping well leads to better health.
**Stronger Relationships**\
Expressing and feeling gratitude can strengthen our connections with others.
**More joy**\
Grateful people get more joy in life, especially derived from small things that others don't even notice.
#### Ways to cultivate gratitude
-   Keep a gratitude journal. Write down three things you're grateful for each day. It may even be the same thing you were grateful for three days ago.
-   Practice gratitude meditation, where you focus on things you're thankful for.
-   Express your appreciation to others regularly. This could be a heartfelt "thank you" or a non-verbal communication.
### **2. Hope**
Hope in Wayism isn't about wishful thinking. It's an active belief that things can improve, coupled with the motivation to make that improvement happen.
#### Benefits of cultivating hope
**Resilience**\
Hopeful people tend to bounce back more quickly from setbacks.
**Goal Achievement**\
Hope provides the motivation to work towards our goals, even when faced with obstacles.
**Better Coping Skills**\
Hope can help us deal with stress and uncertainty more effectively. Survivors of holocausts, famines, and genocides were often the more hopeful people.
**Great friends**\
Hopeful people do not look for things to complain about, do not hand with people who think making small talk is to complain about something, and do not hang with people who make it a habit to tell them about the irritating things their spouses do or how stupid someone was. Hopeful people attract others of like energy and they fuel one another's enthusiasm for life, especially valuable in hard times.
#### Ways to cultivate hope
-   Set realistic goals and create step-by-step plans to achieve them.
-   Reflect on past successes to remind yourself that positive change is possible.
-   Surround yourself with hopeful, positive people.
-   Look for the silver lining in difficult situations. Ask yourself, "What can I learn from this?"
## Spirituality and Connection with the Divine
In Wayism, spirituality isn't about adhering to a specific set of religious beliefs. It's about connecting with something larger than ourselves, the spiritual beings of our type who live in what humans call a heaven. Because we are energy beings and everything is energy, and Wayists have a deeper understanding of the energies, we become aware of being connected to the energies of the universe. Because we understand the purpose of life, that our souls are evolving into immortal spirits beings, we connect to the spirit-beings who act as our caretakers, our guide, divine beings from of heaven --- who introduce us to higher-self meditations and connections with divine energies.
Yet, there exists no religious organization, hierarchical structure, or holy scriptures on Earth --- only interpersonal mystical connections and a few earthly teachers who write books like this.
### Benefits of spirituality
**Sense of Purpose**\
Spirituality can provide a framework for understanding our place in the world and the hereafter.
**Comfort in Difficult Times**\
Spiritual beliefs and connections are a source of solace and inspiration and guidance during challenges.
**Community**\
Sharing spiritual beliefs can connect us with our metaphysical spirit family, and on earth with like-minded individuals.
### Ways to cultivate Wayist spirituality
Explore different spiritual traditions to find what resonates with you. If Wayism resonates with you, it's because you're a senior student in the divinity school of souls --- Butterfly Path.
-   Read more about the path you chose.
-   Practice meditation or prayer.
-   Spend time in nature to connect with the larger energy ecology of living beings around you.
-   Engage in acts of service to others as a way of expressing your spiritual values.
Remember, spirituality is deeply personal. What works for one person might not work for another. The key is to find practices that feel meaningful and authentic to you.
## Humor and Playfulness
While it might not seem as "serious" as the other aspects of transcendence, humor and playfulness are crucial for our well-being. They help us transcend the mundane and find joy in everyday life.
In Wayism, humor and playfulness are considered part of our spirituality and lifestyle because of the powerful effects it has on our higher-self energies.
Humor often roots in wit, and wit signals a mind that seeks things outside the boxes of normal thinking --- and that holds value in Wayism.
### Benefits of humor and playfulness
**Stress Relief**\
Laughter can reduce stress hormones and increase feel-good endorphins.
**Social Bonding**\
Shared laughter can strengthen relationships.
**Perspective**\
Humor can help us see our problems in a new light, making them feel more manageable.
**Philosophy**\
Humor is often used to show the absurd in some ways of thinking, ideologies and cultural philosophies. The 'court jester' of old had the job of providing that service to kings, to help them see the absurdity of things or the extreme outcomes of proposals brought by wealthy people or senators. It ranked among the riskiest occupations worldwide.
### Ways to cultivate humor and playfulness
-   Make time for play. This could be board games, sports, or simply being silly with friends or family. If you choose to prank your partner, it is important to be very careful as it can be considered a very high-risk hobby.
-   Look for the humor in everyday situations. Can you find something amusing in your daily commute or household chores? Learn from your comedy. Is it always funny because it is at the expense of someone else? Humor is not and should not be cruel. Why is it that a biological necessity that all people must do, else they would die, can be funny? A fart is not necessarily funny until it's in an elevator? Humor is illogical and downright stupid sometimes --- and that is why it's significant for our spirituality, our minds, and souls.
-   Watch comedy shows or read humorous books.
-   Practice not taking yourself too seriously. Learn to laugh at your own mistakes and quirks.
Remember, the goal isn't to ignore serious issues or use humor to avoid dealing with problems (which happens when things get tough). Instead, it's about finding balance and bringing more lightness and joy into your life.
By cultivating these aspects of transcendence --- appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, and hope, spirituality, and humor --- we open ourselves up to experiences of awe, wonder, and connection. These experiences can provide a sense of meaning and purpose that goes beyond our individual concerns, leading to greater life satisfaction and emotional well-being.
As with all aspects of the Wayist path, developing transcendence is a journey. Some days, you might feel deeply connected to something greater than yourself, while other days, you might feel stuck in the mundane details of everyday life. That's okay. The key is to keep practicing. Those moments of spiritual transcendence come and go, and that is why we are so deeply moved by them.
Frankly, we are not yet ready to have much more --- we don't yet have the capacity for all that "light." Keep looking for those mini-moments of transcendence in your daily life. Over time, you may find that these moments become more frequent and more profound, enriching your life in ways you never expected.
Chapter 9
## Justice and Temperance
When you hear "justice" and "temperance," you might think of courtrooms and abstaining from alcohol. But in Wayism, these concepts are much richer and more applicable to everyday life. They're about fairness, leadership, forgiveness, humility, and finding balance. Let's explore how these ideas can transform your daily life and relationships.
## Fairness and Leadership
### **1. Fairness**
In Wayism, fairness isn't about treating everyone exactly the same. It's about giving each person what they need to progress on their unique journey. Think of it like watering and feeding plants --- different plants need different amounts of water and different nutrition to thrive.
#### Here's how cultivating fairness can improve your life
**Trust**\
When people see you as fair, they're more likely to trust you. This can lead to stronger relationships, both personally and professionally.
**Inner Peace**\
Acting fair aligns our actions with our values, leading to a sense of inner harmony.
**Conflict Resolution**\
A reputation for fairness can make you a go-to person for resolving conflicts, which can be deeply satisfying.
Try this: Before making a decision that affects others, take a moment to consider all perspectives involved. Challenge your own biases --- we all have them, and recognizing them is the first step to self-truth. Own your biases, be aware of how they shape your worldview and confirmation bias when looking at information; and enjoy your bias as a self-aware person.
But when discussing things with others or making decisions that impact others, take a step back from your bias for a moment and see things from the larger perspective. Often, only about 1% of people in the world share a particular social setting and its ideological biases. When dealing with people who think their experience and ideology is universal, and others should adopt their reality, we help them (as we do for ourselves) to appreciate their existential experience and ideology only applies to their 0.2% or 2% of people in the world. It helps us, and them, to be a bit more sober when deciding what people must need and believe.
Consider, for example, Wayism. We believe it is the ultimate truth and the only philosophy and lifestyle we want. We came to this conclusion after lifetimes of maturing in souls and having had experiences with religions and philosophies and cults of all sorts. Meaning, we researched it for hundreds of years.\
Do we want all people to believe in it? No. Only people who are already self-aware find Wayism interesting enough, and of that 15%, only about half are free to adopt and practice it without social or political constraints. And this is how it has always been.\
Only the most senior souls in the school appreciate teachings of theWAY. It's a senior state of being. All students on the Path will one day mature into it. Our duty is to make sure that seekers can find Wayist materials. That their Taras and Karma can bring Wayism to their consciousness. That is why we all work to get the material out there, all over the world, before the next round of global censorship again removes it from consciousness.\
The point is, our job is not not to convince others to abandon their beliefs and adopt ours --- their divine guide or Karma will help them with that when they are ready. To the point, again, people have their own truths and some read scriptures to hear their God telling them to resort to violence to force people to adopt their truth, others take to the streets and use the violence of tantrums and arson because they want to force people to adopt their truth.
Wayism values the fairness built into the School. All who attend Butterfly Path stand the same chance of graduating one day. This makes the Wayist less judgmental of juniors; helps us to be better at conflict resolution and helps us to know we won't be liked by all too many people because we won't join their mind clubs. Schools are like that. Seniors don't get enough stimulation from hanging with juniors, it's normal.
### **2. Leadership**
Few people want to be leaders, but that is mostly because of how they define what leadership means.
In Wayism, leadership isn't about being the boss. It's about guiding and inspiring others to grow and improve. Many are leaders simply by being an example of an exemplary human being. They make impacts on people's lives that may never be acknowledged or celebrated, yet remembered two generations later. You don't need a title to be a leader --- you can lead in your family, among friends, or in your community.
#### Benefits of developing leadership skills
**Personal Growth**\
The challenges of leadership push us to develop new skills and overcome our limitations.
**Positive Impact**\
Good leadership allows us to make a positive difference in the lives of others.
**Sense of Purpose**\
Taking on leadership roles can provide a strong sense of meaning and purpose.
#### To cultivate leadership
-   Start small. Look for opportunities to take initiative in your current roles.
-   Focus on serving and benefiting others rather than seeking power for yourself. Watch closely as there will almost always be someone who would want to exploit you for that. Studying people, developing social intelligence, is a fun hobby and a much needed skill.
-   Continuously work on your own personal growth. The best leaders lead by example. Children learn how to be human from observing the example of their parents and teachers. As a parent, watch the teachers as closely as you watch your own behaviors.
## Emotional Liberation, Humility, and Self-Regulation
### **1. Emotional Liberation (forgiveness in western psychology)**
In Wayism, what some western practitioners call "forgiveness" is more accurately described as emotional liberation. It's not about excusing injustice or bad behavior, or pretending it didn't happen.\
Rather, it's the process of releasing yourself from the negative emotions associated with being wronged. Think of it as severing an energetic bond that ties you to the hurtful incident or person through feelings of anger, resentment, or hatred.
This energetic liberation is primarily for your own peace of mind and spiritual well-being. It's about freeing yourself from the burden of carrying these negative emotions, not about letting the other person off the hook for their actions.\
By practicing emotional liberation, you're choosing to no longer allow the wrongdoing to have power over your energies, emotional state, and the wellbeing of your loved ones, who are invariably exposed to that energy.
#### Benefits of emotional liberation
**Reduced Stress**\
Holding onto the mind-state of victimhood, anger, and resentment is stressful. Liberating yourself from these emotions can lower your blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol, and adrenaline overproduction. It benefits the gut microbiome and releases your soul-minds to start developing again.
**Improved Mental Health**\
Emotional liberation is associated with lower rates of anxiety and depression.
**Better Relationships**\
The ability to liberate yourself emotionally allows for personal healing and can lead to healthier relationships overall.
#### To practice emotional liberation
-   Start with small offenses and work your way up to bigger ones.
-   Remember that this process is for you, not for the person who wronged you.
-   Consider writing an "emotional liberation letter," to articulate and then release your feelings. Don't send the letter. If you must show it to someone, show it to your soul-minds and spirit-minds, putting them on notice that life starts anew and let's get back to normal energy flows and self-growth.
### **2. Humility**
Humility in Wayism isn't about thinking less of yourself. It's about thinking of yourself less. It's recognizing that we're all part of something bigger than ourselves.
It's about appreciating how absolutely insignificant we are in the cosmic order of things.
The human brain, lauded as the pinnacle of evolution on Earth, is in cosmic terms nothing more than a primitive biological computer, barely able to comprehend its own insignificance. We strut about this minuscule planet, declaring ourselves the masters of all we survey, yet we are less than a speck of dust in the vast expanse of the universe.
Imagine and consider this: If the Milky Way galaxy were the size of North America, our entire solar system would be smaller than a pinhead. And on that pinhead, we must travel 9 billion miles to visit Pluto. There's only 1 million atoms on a pinhead. Meaning we all live on one atom, on the pinhead. And there are billions of galaxies out there, several of them much bigger than our galaxy. Our "advanced" civilization, our greatest achievements, our most profound thoughts --- all of these amounts to less than the musings of an amoeba, in the grand scheme of things.
The average human, so proud of their supposed intelligence, can barely grasp basic scientific concepts. Most cannot explain why the seasons change, how a cell phone works, or even why the sky is blue. We navigate our daily lives surrounded by technology we don't understand, governing ourselves with systems we can't fully comprehend, all while believing we're at the apex of existence.
We humans create religions and gods and write holy scriptures. The gods are male, and like humans, just more powerful --- they are tribal, jealous, murderous, genocidal, always calling for violence, always threatening us with torture and annihilation --- they represent everything bad in the human. The constitutions of countries prohibit what the gods do: they sow division, utter hate speech and their actions contravene the laws of every country and human rights codes. But, they are like our governments who lay down the laws: "We the elite, may and will do; but thou shalt not kill, steal, enslave, nor desire thy neighbors ass or wife".
Our arrogance is staggering. We destroy ecosystems, drive species to extinction, and alter the planet's climate, all while congratulating ourselves on our superiority. Yet, a single virus, invisible to the naked eye, can bring our entire civilization to its knees. A single movement wanting to dominate the world can wipe out all history and technological advances.
We are not special. We are not the center of the universe. We are barely a footnote in the cosmic story. Our greatest intellects, our most powerful leaders, our richest entrepreneurs --- all are as significant as a grain of sand on a beach that stretches beyond the horizon.
This is the humility that Wayism teaches. Not self-deprecation, but a clear-eyed view of our true place in the universe. It's only when we truly grasp our cosmic insignificance that we can appreciate the miraculous nature of our existence and the profound responsibility we bear to make the most of this fleeting opportunity we call life.
For the Wayist, however, in terms of the purpose of human life and the hereafter, we are important and loved by our species of spiritual beings. They root for us to overcome the nature of soul and become beneficent and 'good', so we can join them in being immortal helpers to soul-beings all over our little galaxy.
We are humbled in the cosmic sense. But in our little community of a few billion energy beings, we are recognized and loved as fledgling spirits. We are almost ready to be born into their family, and already we participate in its energy ecology as we grow.
Whenever we depart a body that died, our community typically remembers us for about four months. After that, it's like we were never there. Our prized possessions typically go out to trash within a few months. Death taxes, estate taxes, funeral costs, and tremendous trouble to sort things out with a bank to stop subscriptions and withdrawals, attorney fees, and all makes more trouble for loved ones than what you left is worth. Typically, to die is to be a huge nuisance to others. And that is humbling.
Our existence holds value only within the context of the immortal spiritual community we actively engage with. And that is humbling.
#### Benefits of humility
It is widely accepted in the scientific community that humility brings about numerous advantages. Arrogance, on the other hand, destroys happiness.
**Better Learning**\
Humble people are better learners because they're open to new ideas.
**Stronger Relationships**\
Humility makes us more approachable and easier to connect with.
**Reduced Anxiety**\
When we're humble, we're less worried about always being right or looking good.
**Knowing that you don't know**\
The benefits of knowing that you don't know, are tremendous. Much of that will become clearer in subsequent chapters. Intellectual humility leads to inquisitiveness and a desire to expand one's knowledge and hear what others think and believe.
**Propensity for joyfulness**\
Humble people have deeper joyful experiences that make a more lasting impact on their lives.
**Attracting the correct individuals**\
People who exhibit humility tend to draw in those who are skilled in forming meaningful friendships and relationships. Yet, they become targets for people who see them as perfect for exploiting for their own benefit. Wayist followers possess a deeper understanding of how to free themselves from these vampiric individuals. For the Wayist, humility is not being weak, or defenseless, on the contrary, in humility is strength and resilience.
#### To cultivate humility
-   Practice gratitude. Recognize that many of your successes are because of factors outside your control. The energetic mechanisms behind inspiration and spiritual guidance, even without your cognitive knowing, are important to acknowledge.
-   Seek feedback and be open to constructive criticism. Not everything people say in critique is valid because sometimes they speak only for their own small subset, or they speak from a bad place within themselves. But you must get feedback by being open to criticism.
-   Celebrate others' successes as enthusiastically as your own. The spiritual skill of mudita (vicarious joy; the joy in the good fortune of others) is important in Wayism. It flows very good energy through you and benefits you and yours on many levels.
### **3. Self-Regulation**
Self-regulation is about managing our impulses, emotions, and behaviors. It's a fundamental skill for navigating life's highs, lows, challenges, and setbacks. Self-regulation is the product of each of the soul-minds, each one specializing in its own domain. This means that self-regulation is a soul faculty. The soul must get this skill under its belt before the higher-self will awaken.
Wayism has an extensive teaching on how Attitude is our soul tool to self-regulate and manage energies.
We know that some chemicals prescribed as medicine and others smoked as "benign" drugs, can hinder the development of this important skill. If you rely on medication for self-regulation, you won't learn to do it independently. You will have to wait for the next life to learn that skill.
Babies and children begin learning self-regulation at home by observing their parents, and later on when discipline is enforced. Children get to deal with the feelings evoked when their needs or wants are not immediately satisfied. This instills the skills of self-regulation and self-discipline.
#### Benefits of self-regulation
**Better Decision Making**\
When we're not ruled by our lower-self impulses, we make better choices.
**Improved Relationships**\
Self-regulation helps us avoid saying or doing things we might regret in the heat of the moment. Self-regulation and self-discipline are crucial for job retention and contribute to a smoother experience of following workplace protocols and obeying senior authority.
**Greater Achievement**\
The ability to delay gratification (a form of self-regulation) is strongly linked to success in many areas of life. It also helps us to make better financial decisions because we are not driven by irrational wants, but by fulfilling realistic needs within our means.
#### Improve self-regulation
-   Practice mindfulness meditation to become more aware of your thoughts, drivers, and impulses. You are not unique in wanting to satisfy your wants and needs --- that is something all humans share in common. Self-knowledge sets in when you analyze your internal drivers. It's fun to take an observer seat to watch the ego (Svadhisthana mind) throw tantrums and make arguments why its needs must be fulfilled right now, and Muladhara comes in to make a case that we need to hoard more stuff and build a bunker, and Manipura steps in to say no, we must buy a piece of art or an encyclopedia set because it will benefit us in society. Let them play, and learn how they work, because in the end the soul's minds must be sanctified to desire the butterfly life and not being an obese prominent caterpillar with a great stash of stuff.
-   Use the "pause and plan" technique when you feel strong emotions arising.
-   Set clear goals and create specific plans to achieve them.
-   Follow your inner moral code, your dharma.
## Prudence and Udbhu-kanti (Simplicity and Authenticity)
### **1. Prudence**
Prudence is often misunderstood as being overly cautious or boring. In Wayism, prudence is about making wise and careful decisions. It's about considering the long-term consequences of our actions.
#### Benefits of prudence
**Financial Stability**\
Prudent decision-making often leads to better financial health. Prudence helps us to fulfill long-term needs rather than satisfy ego needs that serve only the next few months.
**Fewer Regrets**\
When we act prudently, we're less likely to make decisions we'll regret later.
**Peace of Mind**\
Prudence can reduce worry about the future because we know we've planned carefully. Even if those plans don't pan out because of having the wrong government in charge, or whatnot, at least we did due diligence and tried the best within our means --- we didn't just go about inviting disaster into our future.
**Security**\
Prudence reminds us that if we make a living selling our labor, that it's a finite resource we have and a lifetime can be long. If we need an employer to give us money for living expenses, we made the decision to be reliant on the economy, employers, and the desirability of the labor and skills we take to the market. It's finite and finicky. Things can change overnight, almost. Our health can change in the wink of an eye and then nobody wants to buy what we have to sell. Prudence helps us to understand this well enough to plan for a more secure means of making a living. As life changes, we abandon certain products and technology. During national or worldwide catastrophes, people lose their shelters and face food shortages due to crippling debt and a lack of buyers for their labor. It's a reminder that circumstances can change suddenly.
#### To develop prudence
-   Before making a decision, consider its potential long-term consequences.
-   Seek advice from those with more experience when facing important decisions.
-   Practice delayed gratification in small ways to build your "prudence muscle."
#### **2. Udbhu-kanti (Simplicity and Authenticity)**
Udbhu-kanti is a Sanskrit term that doesn't have a direct English translation, but it's closely related to the concept of simplicity. It's about finding beauty and contentment in what's genuine and uncomplicated.
Udbhu-kanti says the true measure of beauty is authenticity. The worn old wooden table, the creases of wisdom around the eyes, natural skin, and its natural aging, like old leather and a flower, a bee, a sunset, it's ultimately beautiful because of its essence, its authenticity. We don't replace things because they look a bit worn; they become more beautiful because they are worn and have a history with us.
#### Benefits of udbhu-kanti
**Reduced Stress**\
Simplifying our lives can significantly reduce stress and overwhelm.
**Increased Appreciation**\
When we simplify, we often find more joy in what we have. We use what we have and enjoy having it be part of the family and our shared history together. You don't replace good friends because they're not as young anymore and there's newer models available from the Swipe-A-Friend app.
**Environmental Benefits**\
Embracing udbhu-kanti leads to a more sustainable lifestyle, more compassionate toward other living beings, and less stress on the ecology of one's area.
#### To practice udbhu-kanti
-   Declutter your physical space. Let go of possessions that don't bring you joy or serve a purpose.
-   Simplify your schedule. Learn to say no to commitments that don't align with your values or goals.
-   Practice mindful consumption. Before buying something new, ask yourself if it truly adds value to your life.
By cultivating these aspects of justice and temperance --- fairness, leadership, forgiveness, humility, self-regulation, prudence, and simplicity --- we create a life that's more balanced, peaceful, and fulfilling. These qualities help us navigate the complexities of modern life with grace and wisdom.
Remember, developing these virtues is a lifelong journey. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small victories, and keep in mind that every step towards greater justice and temperance is a step towards a more wholesome and joyful life.
As we move forward, we'll explore how these qualities interact with the concept of transcendence to create a truly balanced and spiritually rich life. Are you ready to discover how to connect with something greater than yourself? Let's dive into the next chapter!
Chapter 10
## Ethics and Morals
### The Wayist Path of Inner Truth
In Wayism, ethics and morals emerge not from external rules or fear of consequences, but from our developing dharma --- our inherent nature shaped by accumulated wisdom. This understanding offers a profound shift in how we approach right and wrong, transforming morality from a system of control into a natural expression of our evolving consciousness.
##  Understanding Ethics and Morals
 While often used interchangeably, ethics and morals represent distinct aspects of our moral consciousness.
###
### Morals
-   Arise from deep inner knowing
-   Provide immediate, clear guidance
-   Connect to emotional intelligence
-   Express our current level of wisdom
-   Feel definitive and personal
###  Ethics
-   Emerge through contemplation
-   Require careful consideration
-   Engage intellectual faculties
-   Often have no final answers
-   Continue evolving with understanding
 ***Sarah\'s Story***\
*\"I used to think being moral meant following rules perfectly. Now I understand it\'s about listening to my deepening wisdom. When faced with a difficult situation at work, I still consult the employee handbook - and I check my inner compass, shaped by years of growth and understanding. Sometimes there isn\'t a clear \'right\' answer, but there is always an authentic response that aligns with my current level of wisdom.\"*
###  The Dynamic Nature of Moral Development
One of the most liberating aspects of the Wayist understanding is recognizing that our moral and ethical framework naturally evolves as we grow in wisdom. Consider:
-   What you once thought was absolutely right might now seem limited
-   Your understanding of complex issues deepens over time
-   Your capacity for nuanced ethical thinking expands
-   Your moral intuitions become more refined
-   Your dharmic understanding grows clearer
### This dynamic nature of moral development brings several insights
1\. We must live authentically at our current level
2\. We should expect our views to evolve
3\. We can hold strong convictions while remaining open to growth
4\. We need not judge others who see things differently
5\. We can trust our inner development
 ***Michael\'s Experience***\
*\"When I first learned about ethical consumption, everything seemed black and white. Now, years later, I see the complexities and interconnections. My choices haven\'t become less ethical -they\'ve become more nuanced, more informed by wisdom rather than rules.\"*
###  Living Your Dharma
 Your dharma --- your personal moral code that arises from wisdom --- becomes your authentic guide. This isn\'t about following external rules but about being true to your current understanding while remaining open to growth.
### Benefits of Following Your Dharma
-   Inner peace from authentic living
-   Reduced moral confusion
-   Natural ethical behavior
-   Growing wisdom
-   Deepening spiritual connection
### Practical Application
####  1. **Personal Level**
-   Regular self-reflection on your values
-   Honest assessment of your motivations
-   Authentic expression of your current understanding
-   Openness to growth and change
-   Trust in your inner wisdom
####  2. **Family Level**
##### **For Parents**
-   Model authentic moral living
-   Share your moral reasoning process
-   Support children\'s moral development without imposing rigid views
-   Help children develop their own inner compass
-   Show how wisdom grows over time
#####
##### **For Children**
-   Create safe spaces for moral questioning
-   Support developing ethical thinking
-   Encourage authentic expression
-   Model moral growth
-   Demonstrate loving acceptance
## Working with Uncertainty
A unique aspect of the Wayist approach is embracing the uncertainty inherent in moral development.
-   Today\'s certainty may be tomorrow\'s stepping stone
-   Our current understanding is always incomplete
-   Growth requires openness to change
-   Wisdom includes knowing we don\'t fully know
-   Authenticity means acknowledging our limitations
### Practical Guidelines
#### 1. **When facing ethical decisions**
-   Check your inner guidance
-   Consider natural law
-   Examine consequences
-   Honor authenticity
-   Serve growth
####  2. **For moral development**
-   Regular reflection
-   Honest self-examination
-   Open-minded learning
-   Authentic expression
-   Patient growth
####  3. **For family guidance**
-   Model authenticity
-   Support questioning
-   Encourage growth
-   Show acceptance
-   Trust development
### Remember
-   Your current moral understanding is perfect for now
-   Growth is natural and expected
-   Authenticity matters more than perfection
-   Inner wisdom develops over time
-   Each person\'s path is unique
 This approach to ethics and morals aligns perfectly with the Wayist path of wholeness. It allows us to be both strong in our current understanding and open to growth. It helps us navigate complex moral situations with wisdom while maintaining the humility to know we\'re always learning.
As you continue your journey, let your moral development be both a compass for today and a path for tomorrow. Trust your developing wisdom while remaining open to growth. This is the way of authentic moral living.
Chapter 11
## Synthesizing Wholesome Mental States: A Wayist Approach
In the Wayist philosophy, the cultivation of positive mental states is not merely a feel-good exercise, but a fundamental aspect of our spiritual journey. As we progress along the Butterfly Path, nurturing wholesome attitudes becomes both a practice and a natural outcome of our evolution.
This chapter will explore how key mental states --- Gratitude, Resilience, and Positivity --- interweave to create a tapestry of well-being, and how we can use the Wayist understanding of Attitude as a powerful tool for energy management.
## Cultivating Positivity in a World of Negativity
In today's world, we are inundated with negativity. The constant barrage of distressing news and societal challenges can overwhelm even the most resilient among us. We are purposely inundated with horrors from global pandemics, conflicts, and environmental disasters to political polarization and societal breakdown. The negativity seems endless.\
We witness and experience the erosion of trust in institutions, the manipulation of information, and the exploitation of vulnerable populations. Our leaders are mere actors in service of a larger authority that is not benign.\
The toxicity extends to our food, medicine, science, our relationships, and even our understanding of truth itself.
This pervasive negativity is not just unpleasant --- it's harmful. It affects our energy, our minds, and our overall well-being. It can lead to a state of menticide, where we struggle to discern truth from falsehood, and where hope seems like a distant memory.
Yet, in the face of this darkness, the Wayist path offers a powerful alternative: the conscious choice of positivity.
In the face of a destructive hurricane sweeping through the land, destroying everything we all held dear for generations, it is useless to expend one's energy resources at the expense of one's health and sanity trying to fight the storm, to wish it was not happening, being angry at the storm, waving one's fist at it for the injustice of it. In this situation we must abandon our external fight to preserve our internal integrity and nurture those energies in order to survive the long term under less than ideal conditions.\
Think of it as a defeated military who retreats in time to an inner world where the enemy will never find them --- and there, they grow strong and survive the new world that the enemy creates. The way to do this is by choosing positivity.
Choosing positivity is not about denying the harsh realities of our world. It's not about turning a blind eye to injustice or pretending that all is well when it clearly isn't. Instead, it's about making a willful decision to nurture the light within us, even as we acknowledge the darkness around us.
This choice is rooted in the Wayist understanding of Attitude as a tool for energy management. By shifting our attitude towards positivity, we can transform our internal landscape, even when we can't immediately change our external circumstances.
## Here's the short story of Carlos
### *The Jungle Within*
*Carlos felt the rough concrete floor beneath him, his back pressed against the damp cell wall. The air was thick with the scent of decay and despair. Screams echoed through the corridors of the jungle prison, a constant reminder of the cruelty that surrounded him.*
*Twenty years. The sentence rang in his ears like a death knell. Few survived even a fraction of that time in this hellhole.*
*As days turned to weeks, Carlos watched fellow inmates wither away, their spirits broken by the relentless brutality. He knew he had to find a way to survive, not just physically, but mentally and spiritually.*
*One morning, as he sat in the small patch of sunlight that filtered through his barred window, a crow landed on the sill. Without thinking, Carlos broke off a piece of his meager bread ration and tossed it to the bird. The crow, wary at first, hopped closer and snatched the morsel.*
*This simple act became a daily ritual. The crow, which Carlos named Negra, soon was a regular visitor. Later, she brought her mate, and Carlos watched in wonder as they built a nest in a nearby tree, visible from his cell.*
*As the weeks passed, Carlos found himself eagerly awaiting the hatching of the eggs. When the chicks finally emerged, he felt a surge of joy he hadn't experienced in years. He named each one, watching them grow and learn to fly.*
*The crows weren't his only companions. A small mouse he called Pequeño now visited his cell, and Carlos discovered a colony of leaf-cutter ants farming fungus beneath the cracked floor.*
*These connections to the natural world around him sparked something in Carlos. He started to see beauty in the smallest details - the intricate patterns of lichen on the walls, the dance of sunlight through leaves, the complex social structures of the insects.*
*At night, when the prison fell into an uneasy silence, Carlos would compose poems and songs in his head, humming quietly to himself. The melodies spoke of hope, of the enduring spirit of life that he saw in his small friends.*
*As months turned to years, Carlos felt himself changing. The anger and bitterness that had initially consumed him began to fade, replaced by a deep sense of peace and connection to the world around him. He found himself responding to the guards' cruelty with compassion, understanding that their actions stemmed from their own pain and fear.*
*His newfound inner strength didn't go unnoticed. Other prisoners sought him out, drawn to the calm energy he exuded. Though direct communication was dangerous, Carlos found ways to share his insights, teaching others to find solace in the natural world around them.*
*One night, after a week of torrential rain, Carlos was awakened by a loud crack. The floor of his cell, weakened by years of ant excavation, collapsed into a sinkhole. Without hesitation, Carlos slipped into the muddy tunnel to crawl towards freedom.*
*For days, he navigated the dense jungle, guided by his crow friends who seemed to understand his plight. They led him to fruit trees and fresh water, while his keen observation of insect behavior helped him avoid dangerous areas.*
*Finally, exhausted but exhilarated, Carlos reached the top of a hill overlooking a city. Civilization lay before him, promising a return to his old life.*
*But as he sat there, Negra and her family perched nearby and Pequeño scurrying at his feet, Carlos realized he had found something far more valuable in the jungle.*
*In the wildlife around him, he saw a world of authenticity and balance. Predators hunted only for survival, not sport or greed. Every creature played its part in the grand tapestry of life, contributing to and respecting the natural order.*
*With a smile, Carlos turned his back on the city. He had found his true home, his true self, here in the jungle. As he descended the hill, back into the embrace of the forest, Carlos felt a profound sense of peace. He was no longer a prisoner, but a student of life, ready to continue learning from the greatest teacher of all - nature itself.*
### Practical steps towards cultivating positivity
1\. Limiting exposure to negative media while staying informed through balanced sources.
2\. Actively seeking out and appreciating moments of beauty and kindness in daily life.
3\. Engaging in acts of compassion and service to others, which can shift focus from global problems to local solutions.
4\. Practicing gratitude for the good things in life, no matter how small.
5\. Nurturing relationships with positive, supportive people.
6\. Engaging in spiritual practices that connect us to something greater than ourselves.
7\. When it comes to energies, you are what you eat in energy terms.
\
The media that you consume (including games) and the company you keep are the primary sources of energy injection into your soul-minds and spirit-minds. Take careful inventory of the energies emitted and intentions of people you allow into your energy circle. People often think they can manage it because, "I don't let them get to me." But that is not letting them "get to\" modify your brain thinking. You don't have the same control over your highly sensitive soul-minds and spirit-minds. The energies are in your aura. This is very intimate.\
Be selective. Whether at church, at work, family, or your social group, there can be people who vampire on the energies of others. Some carry on almost as if they are recruiting members to their 'bad energy club'.\
We have heard some say, "I have a strong personality and some people just can\'t handle me". We have heard women say, "I am a strong and independent woman and men feel threatened by me." That was how they perceived themselves while they were putting out the most awful energies. Some are pessimistic and seek to share that negativity with others.\
And then there are the gossip mongers. You find these evil people on social media as well. They are people who have zero respect and will slander others right up their bedroom privacy, shaming people, hanging dirty laundry out on international forever-media, hoping to bring ruin and shattered dreams to some person or family.
Be an energy snob, it can save your soul.
Remember, choosing positivity doesn't mean we become blind to the world's problems. Instead, it empowers us to face these challenges with resilience, clarity, and hope. It allows us to maintain our humanity --- our kindness, our sense of wonder, our capacity for joy --- even in difficult times.
In a world that profits from our fear and anxiety, choosing positivity is a radical act. It's a declaration that while we may not control world events, we can control our response to them. It's an affirmation of our inner light, and a commitment to letting that light shine, no matter how dark the world may seem.
As Wayists, we understand that this choice is not just for our own benefit, but for the benefit of all beings. By cultivating positivity within ourselves, we contribute to the healing of our communities and our world. We become beacons of hope in a sea of despair, reminding others of the inherent goodness that exists in the world and in each of us.
In the end, positivity is not just a feel-good concept --- it's a vital tool for our spiritual and emotional survival. It's a choice we must make every day, sometimes every moment. And while it may not always be easy, it is always worth it.
### Review and Integration
**Gratitude**\
As we discussed earlier in this book, gratitude is more than a mere sentiment; it's a transformative practice that opens our eyes to the abundance that surrounds us. From the functioning of our bodies to the modern comforts we often take for granted, gratitude helps us recognize the myriad blessings in our lives. This awareness not only enhances our joy but also strengthens our resilience in the face of challenges.
**Resilience**\
We've explored how resilience, the ability to bounce back from adversity, is crucial on our spiritual journey. The Wayist understanding of life's challenges as opportunities for growth empowers us to face difficulties with courage and wisdom. Resilience is not about avoiding hardship, but about growing through it, much like the butterfly emerging stronger from its chrysalis.
**Positivity**\
Building on these concepts, we now introduce Positivity as a vital complement to gratitude and resilience. In a world often dominated by negativity, choosing positivity is a radical act of self-care and spiritual growth.
Positivity, in the Wayist context, is not about denying the harsh realities of our world. It's not turning a blind eye to injustice or pretending all is well when it clearly isn't. Instead, it's about making a willful decision to nurture the light within us, even as we acknowledge the darkness around us.
This choice is particularly crucial in our current era, where we are bombarded with negative information. From global conflicts and environmental crises to political polarization and societal breakdown, the challenges can seem overwhelming. The constant stream of distressing news can affect our energy, our minds, and our overall well-being, potentially leading to a state of menticide where we struggle to discern truth from falsehood.
Yet, it is precisely in these challenging times that the practice of positivity becomes most important. By consciously choosing to focus on the good, to seek out moments of beauty and kindness, we resist the pull towards despair and maintain our capacity for joy, wonder, and compassion.
### Energy Management through Attitude
Central to the Wayist approach is the understanding of Attitude as a tool for energy management. Our attitude --- our mental stance or orientation --- profoundly affects our energy. By consciously shaping our attitude, we can influence not only our mental state but also our energetic body's vibrations or frequencies. The energetic body, the soul and spirit, is the essence of who we are and will be in the future many human lifetimes from now.
#### This principle applies powerfully to the cultivation of gratitude, resilience, and positivity
1\. Gratitude\
By adopting an attitude of thankfulness, we shift our energy from lack to abundance. This energetic shift attracts more positive experiences and enhances our ability to recognize the good in our lives.
2\. Resilience\
An attitude of resilience transforms our energy in the face of challenges. Instead of being drained by difficulties, we can approach them with an energy of curiosity and growth, seeing them as opportunities for evolution.
3\. Positivity\
Choosing an attitude of positivity, especially when surrounded by negativity, is a powerful act of energy management. It creates a protective field around our psyche, allowing us to engage with the world without being overwhelmed by its problems.
#### Practical Applications
##### To integrate these concepts into daily life, consider the following practices
1\. Gratitude Journal\
Each day, write down three things you're grateful for. Include both significant blessings and small pleasures.
2\. Resilience Reflection\
When facing a challenge, pause and ask, "What can I learn from this? How might this help me grow?"
3\. Positivity Scan\
At the end of each day, identify three positive things that happened, no matter how small.
4\. Attitude Shift\
When you notice negative thoughts arising, consciously choose to shift your attitude. Ask, "How can I view this situation in a more positive or growth-oriented way?" "Is this worry something that I am in control of? If not, says Wayism, let go of it and save yourself."
5\. Energy Check-in:\
Throughout the day, take moment to notice your energy. If it feels low or negative, use gratitude, resilience, or positivity to shift it.
#### Conclusion
As we integrate gratitude, resilience, and positivity into our lives, we create a powerful synergy that propels us forward on the Butterfly Path. These mental states, cultivated through conscious attention to our attitude and energy, become both the wind beneath our wings and the nectar that nourishes our growth.
Remember, this practice is not about achieving perfection or denying the very real challenges in our world. It's about creating an internal environment conducive to spiritual growth, one that allows us to engage with life's complexities while maintaining our inner light.
As we master the art of energy management through attitude, we become more effective in our spiritual practice, more resilient in the face of life's challenges, and more capable of radiating positivity to those around us. In doing so, we not only progress on our own journey but also contribute to the healing and upliftment of our world --- truly embodying the Wayist path of personal growth in service of universal evolution.
## Part III: Living the Wayist Path
Chapter 12
## Mindful Living
In Wayism, mindful living isn't just a practice --- it's a way of life. It's about being fully present in each moment, aware of our thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. This awareness allows us to engage more deeply with life, make conscious choices, and find joy in the everyday. Let's explore some key aspects of mindful living and how they can enhance our well-being.
## Cultivating Joy and Awe
Joy and awe might sound like big, rare experiences, but in Wayism, we believe they can be found in everyday life --- if we're paying attention.
### **Joy**
Joy in Wayism isn't about constant happiness or ignoring life's difficulties. It's about finding moments of delight and appreciation, and allowing ourselves to be given to unrestrained joy --- even amidst challenges.
The loss of Joy is regarded by the Wayist as building ourselves into a grey, cold, tomb. Every time we decline ourselves the ability to either see the joy or fully engage in it, is yet another brick in that tomb structure.
#### Benefits of cultivating joy
**Improved Mental Health**\
Regular experiences of joy can help combat depression and anxiety.
**Better Physical Health**\
Joy can boost our immune system and reduce stress-related ailments.
**Enhanced Relationships**\
Joyful people often have stronger, more positive connections with others.
#### Practical ways to cultivate joy
-   Start a "joy spotting" practice --- each day, try to notice at least three things that bring you joy, no matter how small.
-   Engage in activities --- activities that you find genuinely enjoyable, not just entertaining, this could be anything from gardening to dancing to solving puzzles.
-   Practice "savoring" --- when something good happens, pause to really feel and appreciate it.
-   Allowing joy --- smile, laugh, feel and enjoy. A large contingent of European decent cultures consider the show of, or having, joy to be low class. Why is this? Because wealthy people are so beset with energies related to overwork, worries, greed, and competition, they have killed the joy in themselves. On the other hand, poor people know how to have fun and have great joy.\
    So, being sour and always complaining about small things like what the husband does that is gross, how sex is a chore and not pleasant, too much flavor in a dish, a pillow too soft, mattress too hard, service and maids not up to standard, window too open, the weather is changing, now it's too hot, then it's muggy, now it's unpleasantly wet --- that was considered being "high class," and the flex of they who are 'accustomed to better'.\
    They would also spend their time talking smack about accomplished people as a way to elevate themselves, they believe. As if they believe that somehow they become a higher class person when they criticize a self-made billionaire. The inability to wonder and admire in awe and joy the accomplishments of the self-made billionaire or the social activist who sacrificed years fighting to change a law, robs one of deep learning, self improvement, and humaneness.\
    \
    All the while, the economic "lower class," labeled as "the poor," led fulfilling lives. They openly loved and respected their spouses, enjoyed sex and music, family is core and an important source of joy and meaning, they love music and dancing, and have more fun with their meagre financial means than what the self-styled "elite" can have on their billion\$ yachts. They worked hard and then played hard; having exuberant joy and fun. They danced and flirted and played --- they lived real and soul-wholesome lives. They find joy in a simple merry-go-round, a swim in the creek, a nephew's birthday party, a singalong. They glow in the spiritual energies of joy that feed the soul.\
    \
    And while that goes on, the toffee nosed upper-class sit at home going tsk tsk at the 'ruckus' of the low class --- and they will never wake up the next day in an awkward place, feeling the glow of goodness from having experienced true joy and the warmth of true friends and family.\
    \
    But the true low class has always been the middle class who think they are more special than the poor; believing that showing money (even if you have to take it on debt) makes other people think you are rich and therefore respect you. It is the most shallow level of existence, this type of middle class low class. They are overbearingly loud in every way because their ego must be seen. They will have the longest nails and eyelashes, the loudest jewelry and silicone body construction going on. They break things, flash grossly cheap-looking expensive jewelry and labels. They get violent, are easily offended (because it shows how special they are), and own a lot of things on credit and mortgage. They believe their hollow-ridden sex organs are somehow differently desirable, so they show it to everyone --- and they will never wake up the next day in an awkward place, feeling the glow of goodness from having experienced true joy and the warmth of true friends and family.
Chances are many had their joy killed by their cultural conditioned thinking. Visit Mexico, Africa, South East Asia or South America, be observant and wiling to learn (if you can) and discover respect, honor, joy, authenticity and complete living. Or, this may be easier, just learn to have joy like you were a child again, before the killjoys got to your soul.
Did you know that Lord Jesus says in a text preserved by Christians, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." In Wayist sources the Lord says similar things about children, joy, awe and the kingdom of heaven within. People of theWAY always followed that teaching, but when the Christians took over the movement of theWAY in the West, they made it a killjoy religion based on the angry warmongering god of the Old Testament --- so Joy packed-up her stuff and moved East.
Reclaim, and own your Joy, your soul depends on it.
### **Awe**
Awe is that feeling of wonder and amazement when we encounter something greater than ourselves. It doesn't have to be a grand canyon or a starry sky --- awe can be found in the intricacy of a flower, the ecosystem in fertile soil, mycelium under the forest floor, the squid or octopus, a baby's laughter, falling in love, or the kindness of a stranger.
#### Benefits of experiencing awe
**Expanded Perception of Time**\
Awe can make us feel like we have more time, reducing feelings of impatience or being rushed. In awe, we are truly present in the movement and the concept of time is not important at all --- a more ideal state of being for an immortal being, isn't it?
**Increased Generosity**\
People who experience awe regularly, tend to be more generous and helpful to others.
**Improved Well-being**\
People regularly experiencing awe are associated with having lower levels of inflammatory compounds in the body, which are linked to various health issues. Their energies are healing themselves. It is as if awe connects us to purer divine energies which flow through us.
#### Ways to cultivate awe
-   Spend time in nature, even if it's just observing a tree or cloudscape.
-   Learn about scientific discoveries or historical events that amaze you.
-   Watch videos of natural wonders or space exploration.
-   Reflect on the interconnectedness of all things.
-   Spend time with your Divine Guide and enter into those higher energies they guide you to and impart to you.
## Energy Ecology and Hygiene
In Wayism, we understand that everything is energy, including our thoughts and emotions, but most prominently, our soul and spirit --- our only true self. Energy ecology is about playing our part in maintaining wholesome energies in the world around us. Most squirrels and raccoons, birds, and water, fish, and plants have good energy --- we should not just walk by and spoil that good energy with our mean energy --- we should contribute to the goodness.
Energy hygiene refers to practices that keep our personal energy clear and positive. Like washing the organic body, because if you don't it stinks, you also wash your self-body --- your soul and spirit.
We "wash away" the unwanted, soiled energies, that collected in our energy bodies during the day, just as we wash away the organic grime that clings to our skin and teeth. Some people will have a thorough hygiene routine for the organic body but not for their own essence, the soul, and their young and fledgling spirit. The organic body is aging and you will soon let go of it, to go to Paradise to await a new organic body. But the soul and spirit, do you take care of their hygiene needs? You will live much longer than the organic body. Don't go about in the energy domains smelly, forcing Paradise to quarantine you to a washroom when you arrive. You can distinguish yourself from most demons by taking better care of your energy hygiene.
Think of your energies as a perfume or cologne --- almost like a subtle-body odor. People sense it. Some may like it, some won't. Some people read a lot into why you choose to carry that aura around with you. Your "perfume" also infuses into your living space.
> Here's a pro tip. If you know that you have a bad subtle-body odor because you did not do your energy cleansing, and someone is attracted to you because of it --- go on social media and tell people you picked up on a red flag.
#### Benefits of good energy ecology and hygiene
**Reduced Stress and Improved Health**\
By managing the energies around and within us, we can create a more peaceful, harmonious environment. Our energies affect not only our brain-mind and body-minds, but are infused in our living spaces and material possessions. We clean our home, else bacteria and critters breed there. If someone had a contagious infection, we would decontaminate the house and air ducts. What about the mind and soul energies which we deposit in our living spaces? Should we not have a hygiene routine for that? Is it okay to have it seep into the structure and be sensible to others, and reinfect us when we come home? Watching a negative energy movie and having an awful domestic argument is like having rolled around in muck --- clean up whatever it was that you contaminated afterward, else the stains may become permanent.
**Improved Relationships**\
Being aware of energy dynamics can help us navigate social situations more skillfully.
**Enhanced Creativity**\
A clear, balanced energy field can boost our creative output. We need our creative side to engage in most spiritual disciplines and to fully immerse ourselves in Joy and Awe and Gratitude and Positivity.
#### Practical ways to maintain good energy ecology and hygiene
-   Practice "energy awareness" --- pay attention to how different people, places, and activities affect your energy levels.
-   Create a harmonious home environment. This might involve decluttering, using colors and textures that feel good to you, or incorporating plants or natural elements. Consult the Udbhu-kanti writings.
-   Use visualization techniques to "clear" your energy field. Imagine a bright light washing over you, cleansing any negative energy. Physically shower and do the spiritual energy cleaning, get your heart out of that gutter and visualize the unwanted energy washing away.
-   Be mindful of the media and music you expose yourself to and consume, and the conversations you engage in. It's your energy diet. Choose inputs that uplift and inspire you.
## Maintaining Pneuma-Psycho-Physical Balance
In Wayism, we recognize the deep connection between soul, spirit, mind and body. Maintaining pneuma-psycho-physical balance is about nurturing our mental and physical well-being in harmony with our soul and spirit bodies' wholesomeness.
#### Benefits of pneuma-psycho-physical balance
**Improved Overall Health**\
When our minds and bodies are in sync, our entire system functions better.
**Greater Emotional Stability**\
Physical practices can help regulate our emotions and quality of thoughts, and vice versa.
**Enhanced Cognitive Function**\
A balanced body, soul, and spirit leads to a clearer, more focused mind.
#### Ways to maintain pneuma-psycho-physical balance
-   Practice spirit-soul-mind-body exercises like Karman active meditation, yoga, tai chi, or qigong.
-   Engage in regular physical activity that you enjoy.
-   Pay attention to your body's signals and respect its needs for rest, nutrition, and movement.
-   Take wellness breaks to get balance by doing something very different from your normal life, to calm your minds and bodies. Simple deep breathing can be remarkably effective for the immediate acute relief, but you need deep healing, so take those breaks routinely.
-   Ensure you're getting adequate sleep. Good sleep hygiene is crucial for both mental and physical health.
## Karman Meditation and its Benefits
Karman meditation is a unique Wayist practice that combines physical movement with mindfulness and energy work. It's designed to align our physical, mental, and spiritual energies.
One can do it alone, or in a group. No matter one's age or physical strength, all practitioners (even in the same group) get maximum benefit because we work against our own resistance.
#### Benefits of Karman meditation
**Increased Mind-Body Awareness**\
This practice helps us become more attuned to the connection between our physical sensations and our mental states.
**Improved Energy Flow**\
Karman meditation is helps clear subtle-energy flows and promote healthy energy circulation in the bodies.
**Enhanced Focus and Clarity**\
Regular practice can lead to improved concentration, purpose, and mental clarity.
**Regrouping and Resetting**\
This meditation gets us ready for yet another day of living to the fullest. We process the past days' energies and reset, re-invigorate all our chakras and focus on the Path. This prepares us energetically and psychologically for the tasks ahead.
#### How to practice Karman meditation
1\. Start in a comfortable standing position.
2\. Take a few deep breaths to center yourself.
3\. Following the movement and technique chart, begin your movements, coordinating them with your breath.
4\. As you move, focus your attention on the energetic sensations in your body and chakras, and recite the affirmation to push the energy where it must go.
5\. Visualize positive energy flowing through your body and chakras with each movement, and how negative energies flow out.
6\. Gradually increase the complexity of movements as you become more comfortable with the practice.
7\. End with a few moments of stillness, noticing how you feel.
Remember, like any meditation practice, Karman meditation takes time to master. Every bit is helpful. Be patient with yourself and enjoy the journey.
By incorporating these practices of mindful living into our daily lives, we can create a more balanced, joyful, and aware existence. These aren't just isolated techniques, but interconnected aspects of a holistic approach to life. As we cultivate joy and awe, maintain good energy ecology and hygiene, balance our psycho-physical well-being, and engage in practices like Karman meditation, we're not just improving individual aspects of our lives --- we're nurturing our whole being.
This mindful approach to living allows us to fully engage with life, to appreciate its richness and complexity, and to navigate its challenges with greater ease and grace. It's about being fully present in our lives, moment by moment, and consciously choosing how we want to show up in the world.
Remember, mindful living is a practice. Some days will be easier than others. The key is to keep coming back to these principles, to keep choosing awareness and presence, even when it's challenging. Over time, you may find that this mindful approach becomes second nature, infusing every aspect of your life with greater clarity, purpose, and joy.
Chapter 13
## Relationships and Community
In Wayism, we understand that we don't exist in isolation. Our connections with others --- from our most intimate physical and spiritual relationships to our role in the larger community and our role in the planet's energy ecology --- play a crucial role in our spiritual growth and overall well-being. This chapter explores how to approach relationships and community involvement from a Wayist perspective because these two factors are frequently mentioned as contributors to the happiness and success of the most-wholesome people on the planet.
## Love and Intimacy
Love and intimacy are fundamental human needs, rooted deeply in our soul's desires. They have the power to be sources of immense joy or profound pain. In Wayism, we approach love and intimacy with mindfulness, compassion, and a deep understanding of their spiritual dimensions.
While all soul-beings experience love and form communities --- a normal and essential aspect of human existence --- the spiritually awakened among us have access to a higher dimension of love and compassion. This elevated experience of love comes through the activation of the Anahata chakra, or heart center, which brings spiritual elements to our capacity for love and compassion.
The loves that we discover and the intensities of love and compassion that we experience through the Anahata chakra are far more advanced than the love which most soul-beings experience. This spiritual love transcends the basic needs for connection and belonging, reaching into realms of unconditional acceptance, profound empathy, and a sense of oneness with all beings.
For the Wayist, love becomes a path of spiritual growth and self-discovery. It's not just about romantic partnerships or family bonds, but about cultivating a heart that is open to all of existence. This love extends beyond human relationships to encompass nature, the cosmos, and the divine.
Through this spiritual lens, intimacy takes on new meaning as well. It becomes not just physical or emotional closeness, but a meeting of souls, a recognition of the divine in another. This form of intimacy can be experienced in moments of deep connection with a partner, a friend, or even a stranger who crosses our path.
As we progress on the spiritual path, we learn to balance the soul's need for love and connection with the spirit's capacity for universal love. We learn to love deeply while also practicing non-attachment, to be intimate while maintaining our individual spiritual journey.
This approach to love and intimacy brings a new level of wholeness to our relationships and our lives. It allows us to experience the full spectrum of human emotion while also touching the transcendent, creating a bridge between our earthly existence and our spiritual nature.
In practicing this elevated form of love, we not only enrich our own lives but contribute to the healing and evolution of collective consciousness. Each act of compassion, each moment of heart-centered connection, ripples out into the world, creating a more loving and harmonious existence for all.
### **1. Love**
In Wayism, love isn't just a feeling --- it's a way of being. It encompasses not only romantic love, but also love for family, friends, and even strangers.
Each soul-mind and spirit-mind specialize in a unique type of love. We are becoming spirit-beings of loving-kindness and beneficence. We must learn every type of love.
#### Benefits of cultivating love
**Improved Mental Health**\
Loving relationships are associated with lower rates of depression and anxiety.
**Better Physical Health**\
Love can boost our immune system and even help us live longer.
**Spiritual Growth**\
Practicing love helps us connect with our higher-selves and with the divine.
#### Ways to cultivate love
-   Practice loving-kindness meditation. This involves sending thoughts of love and well-wishes to yourself, loved ones, neutral people, difficult people, and all beings.
-   Perform acts of kindness without expectation of return. This principle is as ancient as Wayism itself. It form the basis of teachings in the Upanishads and in Bhagavad Gita as well. Here's how it was said in the most ancient writings: "Do, because you cannot not do, and do with no expectations of results and especially no expectations of acknowledgment."
-   Work on self-love. Remember, you can't pour from an empty cup. Did you know, a famous teacher of theWAY once said, \"To enter heaven you must love God our Father and God our Mother in Heaven, you must love your neighbors, and love yourself.\" By this the Teacher said you must master higher-self spiritual love (for heaven), you must have positive regard and show loving-kindness for all living beings because all have souls (neighbors), and you must have the same kindness for yourself. If you cannot love your spirit, how can you evolve into a spirit-being?
To love your spirit --- love your divine spiritual guide, the deity will show you how to do it --- allow yourself to become aware.
To love the Divine --- love your divine spiritual guide, the deity will show you how to do it --- allow yourself to be guided and the flow of love.
### **2. Intimacy**
Intimacy in Wayism goes beyond physical closeness. It's about deep soul-energy emotional connections and spirit-energy spiritual connection. It is an intimate exchange of energies at levels that are not normally associated with platonic relationships.
We develop intimate relations with soul-beings on the soul level, and with our divine guide on the spirit level, and with our lover's body on the physical level. Although a widely accepted principle in Wayism, it is understood that only approximately 10% of individuals worldwide reach the stage where they form deep, long-lasting connections encompassing spirit, soul, body, and mind.
Intimacy and sensuousness, touch, taste, and feeling one another, are important in Wayist spirituality because it engages our entire being in something beautiful and positive.
#### Benefits of intimacy
**Emotional Support**\
Intimate relationships provide a safe space for 'just being', a moment suspended in time.
**Personal Growth**\
Intimacy often challenges us to confront our fears and grow as individuals.
**Shared Joy**\
Deep connections allow us to share and amplify life's joys.
**Spiritual Growth**\
Interpersonal intimacy on the spiritual dimension advance us to have deeper intimacy when connection to our Divine Guide and in our mystic mediations and connections with divine energies.
#### Ways to foster intimacy
-   Practice active listening. Really tune in to what your partner or friend is saying without planning your response.
-   Share your own thoughts and feelings openly and honestly.
-   Touch, caress, and enjoy being close.
-   Create rituals of connection, like a weekly date night or a daily check-in.
-   Create rituals of spiritual connection, like daily or weekly prayer and meditation sessions. Cultivate an attitude of meditation and a prayerful habit that travels with you during your working day --- you are never alone.
-   Say that you love --- to all your loved ones, including your personal deity.
### Parenting and Raising Children on the Path
Parenting is one of life's greatest duties, challenges, and joys. The karma from neglecting this duty --- to transfer life skills and a personal life philosophy to the child --- is severe. From a Wayist perspective, parenting is an opportunity for tremendous spiritual growth --- both for the parent and the child.
#### Key principles of Wayist parenting
1\. **Respect for the Child's Journey**\
Remember that each child is a soul-spirit-being who may be ancient and advanced in degree or young and junior in degree, or at your level in the School. There is about a 20% probability that some people in the household or family have friendship or karmic bonds from previous lifetimes.
Each soul is at their own level or degree in the school of divinity for souls --- Butterfly Path. Our job is to prepare children with all the necessary skills to naviagte human lives at this present time in this context and culture --- many of the skills you must transfer were discussed in this book. We are guides and a support structure to them. We may never shield them from being accountable for their actions and unwise choices --- not even deities interfere with Karma because that is how we learn and advance. We cannot manipulate or completely dominate them but we must instill discipline because an undisciplined person is not prepared for life. They must live their human experience according to their soul's maturity and gain wisdom from those experiences, so do not interfere in their karma. You cannot shield them from unpleasant experiences --- what do you know about their past lives' karma and the karmic learning needs they came with? To willfully form their programmable minds into something you believe, some social ideology, is a karmic debt on you. Your job is to prepare them to own their own mind and critically evaluate things, and make their own decisions about social ideologies one day when they are ready. Their failure may be due to lack of parenting. Often, what you perceive as failure, may be them failing your expectations of them and not knowing their karmic background, you shall not hold expectations.
2\. **Teaching by Example**\
Children learn more from observing how we conduct ourselves than from what we tell them to do. Living our values is the best way to pass them on. Teach them about consequences. Give them the skills of self-discipline and a good work ethic, prepare them with good values as you live them. Then, you must allow them to go out there and live out their human experience. At 18-years old they are well prepared from almost two decades of hard work that you invested in them, its time to go and live their human experience, the very reason they came to earth. If they still like you when they are in their 30\'s count that as a blessing --- you found a good friend. If they want to be just like you, teach them to aim higher. If they don't like you when they're young and can't wait to get out of the house --- know that is how nature works, and smile. Prepared them as best you can to fly on their own wings.
Remember that to spoil something is to break it. To willfully let something spoil, for example, to pour sugar over it and let it sit till it's rotten, that's an interesting lab experiment to watch but its not something you do to a human. Spoiled meat is headed for the trash. Spoiled children have the hardest time as adults to finding their success, happiness, and joy, or becoming spiritually enlightened.
3\. **Cultivating Wisdom and Compassion**\
Help children develop not just knowledge, but wisdom --- the ability to apply knowledge with compassion and understanding.
4\. **Encouraging Curiosity and Wonder**\
Foster a sense of awe and curiosity about the world. This lays the groundwork for spiritual awareness.
5\. **Humbleness**\
You know very well how people detest arrogant people, and how those people suffer in life and hardly ever find their wholesomeness and peace. Transfer the skill and mindset of humbleness to prepare your child for life.
6\. **Respect**\
Everything is based on respect. Self-respect comes from having learned to respect one's deity, parents, and guardians, teachers, and workers, the homeless and down on their luck people, animals, food, and the environment, money, and resources, and one day --- their partners and children.
#### Practical tips for Wayist parenting
-   Understand the long-term nature of child-rearing\
    Just as formal education from pre-school to PhD takes about 18 years to build a foundation of knowledge and critical thinking skills, parenting is a long-term commitment to laying the groundwork for your child's future.
-   Focus on transferring foundational skills and principles\
    During these formative years, concentrate on teaching your children essential life skills, ethical principles, and critical thinking abilities. This is not the time for them to form independent theories or make life-altering decisions.
-   Recognize the stages of development\
    Just as a university student cannot responsibly publish independent research until after post-grad studies, children shouldn't be burdened with major life decisions before they have the necessary experience and knowledge base.
-   Gradually increase independence\
    As your child grows and demonstrates understanding of the principles you've taught, slowly give them more autonomy in decision-making and dealing with the consequences, always in age-appropriate ways.
-   Prepare them for eventual independence\
    Your goal is to equip your child with the tools they need to think and act independently one day as a young adult. This doesn't happen overnight, but is the result of years of guidance and teaching.\
    Academic prowess is only about 50% (if that), of what a child must master. The life skills that the child will learn at home, and not through a school program, make up the balance.
-   Be patient and consistent\
    Remember that just as rushing a student through their education would be detrimental, trying to rush a child's development can have negative consequences. Consistently apply your principles and teachings over time. Lead by example: Demonstrate the principles and skills you're teaching in your own life. Children learn as much from observation as they do from direct instruction.
-   Cultivate wisdom alongside knowledge\
    While imparting knowledge is important, also focus on helping your child develop wisdom - the ability to apply knowledge appropriately in various life situations.
Remember, your role as a Wayist parent is to guide and nurture, preparing your child for their own journey on the Butterfly Path. Your consistent teachings and example over these formative years will provide them with the strong foundation they need to eventually make their own wise choices and contributions to the world.
-   Create family rituals that foster connection and spiritual awareness. This could be as simple as sharing what you're grateful for at dinner time.
-   Encourage questions about life, death, and the nature of reality. It's okay not to have all the answers --- exploring together is valuable.
-   Teach mindfulness techniques appropriate for your child's age.
-   Involve children in acts of service to others.
-   Spend time in nature together, fostering a sense of connection with the natural world.
-   Teach being inquisitive, and to seek the awe in life.
-   Teach that disappointments or failure or coming second is exactly what life is about.
-   Yin and Yang parental energy.\
    Children need male and female role models to learn from, because all of life is about male and female energies, all the universe is made up of Yin and Yang energies in various combinations. Your children learn about how men treat women from how dad treats mom, and how mom treats dad. They learn about what they like and dislike in men and women from observation.
-   Be yourself.\
    Your children learn from you being yourself. They need a parent, not a friend or buddy --- that they can get aplenty elsewhere, but parents are rare and precious. Let them think you are old and behind the times, because you are, and that is what parents are --- the ancient foundation upon which we build the new society. One day, they look back to the solid, stubborn, behind the times old fogies and they bank on that wholesomeness as they go about testing their own wings and making their own future, and they too will be the stubborn, behind the times minds, with which to raise their own children.
Remember, parenting is a journey of growth for both parents and child. Be patient with yourself and your child as you navigate this path together. Prepare yourself for the time they leave home and let them fly to learn the high skills of life without a catch net.
### Contributing to Society
In Wayism, we believe that contributing to society is not just a civic duty, but a spiritual practice. Our society, however, encompasses all living beings and the spaces we share with them. Our participation in the energies and happenings of society is a way of recognizing our interconnectedness and playing our part in the greater whole.
Society is not something that beckons us to join and conform to the prevailing mindset, no, we go there and be our authentic selves, yet we are polite, and pleasant, a good friend and a trustworthy human being with Wayist values.
#### Benefits of contributing to society
**Sense of Purpose**\
Helping others and contributing to a cause greater than ourselves can provide a deep sense of meaning and purpose.
**Improved Mental Health**\
Volunteering and community involvement are linked to lower rates of depression and increased life satisfaction.
**Expanded Perspective**\
Engaging with different parts of our community can broaden our understanding of the world and increase empathy.
#### Ways to contribute to society
-   Volunteer for causes you care about. This could be anything from environmental conservation to helping at a local food bank or shelter, or a local councilor's campaign.
-   Participate in local government or community organizations. Attend town halls or join a community board.
-   Practice random acts of kindness. Small actions like helping a neighbor or picking up litter can make a big difference.
-   Use your skills to benefit others. If you're a teacher, you might offer free tutoring. If you're an artist, you could donate work to charity auctions. Contribute to the Wayist cause of creating teaching materials for all levels and grades around the world.
Remember, contributing to society doesn't always mean grand gestures. Consistent small actions can have a profound impact over time.
### Developing Social Intelligence and Empathy
Social intelligence and empathy are crucial skills for navigating relationships and community interactions. They help us understand and connect with others more deeply.
#### Benefits of social intelligence and empathy
**Better Relationships**\
Understanding others' perspectives and emotions leads to smoother, more fulfilling relationships.
**Reduced Conflict**\
Empathy helps us navigate disagreements more constructively.
**Increased Influence**\
People who are socially intelligent are often more effective leaders and change-makers., but primarily they are happier and less prone to mental health diagnoses and medications.
#### Ways to develop social intelligence and empathy
-   Practice active listening. Focus fully on understanding the other person rather than formulating your response. You listen to learn, not to say something. Say something only if it enhances the direction of the discussion, not only because you want to feature as someone who said something.
-   Learn to read non-verbal cues. Watch people. Body language and tone of voice often communicate more than words. Often, it is what people neglect to say or include in their sentence that speak to their reality. To know these things and benefit from true communication, learn to listen and observe.
-   Put yourself in others' shoes. When you disagree with someone, try to imagine the context that led them to their perspective, and what the world looks like from their point of view. Do this not to change them, but it's good to learn how people's minds work because you also learn self-knowledge --- the true wisdom.
-   Read fiction. Studies have shown that reading fiction can increase empathy.
-   Seek out diverse perspectives. Respectfully engage with people from different backgrounds and life experiences. Eat their food, attend festivities and celebrations, feel their culture, and reflect on how many hundreds of years their culture is older than yours. To appreciate it more, think about how your culture changed in the past 100 years, then reflect on how a deep is a culture that has many hundreds of years behind it.
Developing these skills is an ongoing process. Be patient with yourself and remember that every interaction is an opportunity to learn and grow.
In Wayism, we see our relationships and community involvement as integral parts of our spiritual path. By approaching love and intimacy with mindfulness, parenting with wisdom and respect, contributing to society, and developing our social intelligence and empathy, we not only enhance our own lives but also contribute to the well-being of those around us.
These practices help us live out the Wayist understanding of interconnectedness. As we nurture our relationships and engage with our community, we're not just improving our individual lives --- we're contributing to the greater tapestry of human experience. We're playing our part in creating a more compassionate, understanding world.
Remember, like all aspects of the Wayist path, this is a journey. There will be challenges and setbacks along the way. The key is to approach each interaction, each relationship, each community engagement as an opportunity for growth and learning. With patience, persistence, and compassion --- for others and for ourselves --- we can create rich, fulfilling relationships and make meaningful contributions to our communities.
Chapter 14
## Spiritual Practices
Spiritual practices are the heart of Wayism. They're not just rituals or routines performed to appease a deity, but powerful tools for energy management, personal growth, self-discovery, and connection with something greater than ourselves.
In this chapter, we'll explore some key spiritual practices in Wayism and how they can enhance our daily lives and overall well-being.
## Prayer and Connection with a Divine Tara
In Wayism, prayer isn't about asking for favors from a distant deity. It's a way of connecting with our Divine Tara, our personal spiritual guide and protector.
We may ask for help in forming an understanding of a problem, and how to deal with it, but we don't expect a deity will roll a rock out the way because we are the ones on the Path and getting around the rock is a learning opportunity that will one day help us graduate from Butterfly Path school.
### Understanding Divine Tara
The concept of Divine Tara might be unfamiliar to many in the West. The title "Tara" means "they who ferry us from one shore to the next." In Buddhism, Taras are recognized as "buddha makers" because they guide us along the Path and walk with us to the "other shore" upon its completion. In Wayism, Taras are also described as our divine charioteers (suratha) to whom we entrust the 'driving' of the chariot (our body, with its minds and senses as the horses) on this journey. The Bhagavad Gita, which holds a special place in Wayism, uses this analogy.
Think of your Tara as a deity personally accessible to you, a holy spirit assigned as your guide and comforter on your spiritual journey. From the moment we first set foot on Butterfly Path, our Tara adopts us as their charge. As hybrid-beings on this Path, we are energetically fragile and often fragmented as we grow and change (like caterpillars), necessitating an energy protector. In a world where malevolent soul-beings exist, our Taras shield us from unseen onslaughts, safeguarding our soul energies and nurturing our fledgling spirits over many human lifetimes.
As we mature spiritually, we develop the need, desire, and skill to connect with our Tara. They are specially equipped to meet us at the lowest spiritual energy we can access, which lies in the spectrum of Vishuddhi chakra-mind energies. We connect to the spirit domain through this chakra when we pray and meditate. However, this powerful connection requires the passion of the Heart chakra (Anahata) to provide the necessary energy, akin to electrical amperage. The Vishuddhi connection with Tara consumes significant energy, which only Anahata can supply.
Therefore, the loving desire from Anahata chakra, coupled with access to Vishuddhi energies, enables and sustains our connection with Tara. Powered by love and passionate desire from Anahata, we connect in spirit with our divine Tara.
Divine Taras are known by various names across traditions. In Christianity, they're referred to as angels or the holy spirit. Lord Jesus called our Taras a holy spirit who is our comforter and guide. Other traditions use the term guardian angel. While soul religions often view angels as subordinate beings, in Wayism, we recognize our Tara as a divine being --- a perfected spirit-being. To us, all spirit-beings are gods.
Our Tara guides us towards eventual rebirth in heaven as a deity, where we too become a spirit-being, or a buddha as they say in Buddhism. We will then share the same heaven as Gautama Buddha, Lord Krishna, Lord Jesus, Rumi, and Kabir, Sant Mirabai, Mother Lalleshwari, and Sant Janabai, among others. All humans are on this one Path --- the Butterfly Path. If successful, we become immortal spirit-beings, continuing our existence as beneficent, helpful beings embodying loving-kindness. Our eternal role will be to assist soul-beings across the galaxy who are in energetic distress.
This future, as divine helpers, is the ultimate purpose of our earthly existence as soul-beings having human experiences. We are here to learn the spiritual skills we will one day use in our eternal, beneficent existence. This is our destiny in the metaphysical community of the heavens.
#### Benefits of connecting with Divine Tara
**Guidance**\
Tara can provide inspiration, insights, and direction when we're facing difficult decisions or life challenges.
**Comfort**\
Knowing we have a divine companion brings comfort during times of stress or loneliness.
**Spiritual Growth**\
Regular communication with Tara can accelerate our spiritual development.
**Companionship**\
Once we enter an energetic relationship with our guiding deity, we are in almost constant companionship, never alone. We are in communion with someone who knows and sees our ancient essence, who has seen us grow up and mature ever since we set out first barbaric foot on the planet. Someone who has seen us at our lowest, and helped us through many atrocities, some of which history attests. Someone who knows us like no other being can ever know. For most People of theWAY, this relationship is the most intimate and most precious because it lasts lifetimes and we could not have come this far without it.
**Belonging**\
To belong to the spiritual family, to be one of them, a spiritual child in the making, is a comforting thought. It grounds us not only in the here and now but in the future after the death of the body, and however many human lifetimes (if any) we may still need. We have an identity, a place where we belong, and a place where we are known and awaited. This sense of identity and security, of extended family, gives us peace and beauty, inner harmony, and an assured expectation of what the future holds, no matter what life on earth may do to the body.
#### How to Practice Prayer and Connection with Divine Tara
1\. Find a quiet, comfortable space where you won't be disturbed.
2\. This crucial step may require practice. Open or access the lowest spiritual energy spectrum where your divine guide can meet you. This is the lowest spectrum of Vishuddhi mind energy. Your divine guide is specially trained to meet you, even at the lowest of these energy layers.
To access this 'channel', attune your heart to desire connection with the divine with your whole being. If you struggle to approach a deity with sincerity, openness, honesty, and respect, it means you're not yet able to tune into that channel.
> **Caution**\
> If you approach this like a Ouija board, divination, or tarot deck, you won't connect to your Tara --- those methods connect to disembodied souls. Spiritual connections are not for fascination or divination. If you're not ready, try again when you're spiritually more mature. Without the right divine energy channel, you risk connecting with a powerful soul-being, which has different natures and motives than you can work with.\
> \
> How to discern\
> A soul entity masquerading as an "angel" might tell you names of people and places, show earthly signs, or discuss trivial human matters. In contrast, connecting with your Tara will be profoundly divine, leaving you transformed for days.
3\. Visualize a warm, loving glow surrounding you. This is the energy space you prepare and sanctify, into which you "invite your Divine Guide." As in the biblical story of Moses, consider this holy ground.
4\. Speak to Tara as you would to a trusted divine friend, either aloud or in your mind.
5\. Share your thoughts, feelings, and questions openly and honestly.
6\. After speaking, sit in silence. Pay attention to any thoughts, feelings, or insights that arise. Be attentive not just in the moment, but in the days that follow, watching for inspiration or changes in attitude. These could be Tara's responses.
7\. End with gratitude for Tara's presence and guidance.
8\. With time and practice, you may experience a powerful connection that profoundly changes your life in ways beyond description.
Remember, connecting with Tara is a skill that develops over time. Be patient with yourself as you cultivate this practice. The depth and power of this connection grow with your spiritual maturity and sincere effort.
### Meditation and Energy Work
Meditation and energy work are fundamental practices in Wayism, helping us to calm our minds, balance our energies, and connect with our higher-selves.
Recall also from a prior chapter the discussion about how we use the power of Attitude to change our energies. Attitude can move one's main driver-energies from one state to another within a second. Making a permanent change in attitude often involves doing work while practicing self-reflective meditation.
Energy work and maintenance is important to the Wayist.
#### Benefits of meditation and energy work
**Stress Reduction**\
Regular meditation along with energy work significantly lowers stress levels and improves overall well-being. It makes one a nicer person to live with and benefits relationships and a holistic sense of self as a person in control of the self.
**Improved Focus**\
Meditation enhances our ability to concentrate and stay present.
**Emotional Regulation**\
These practices can help us manage our emotions more effectively. What it amounts to is taking charge with higher-self over the lower-self, our soul. We become spirit-people because we are mostly governed by higher-self minds, as opposed to being soul-people who are mostly governed by their soul-minds.
**Spiritual Awareness**\
Meditation and energy work can lead to profound spiritual insights and experiences. As we advance in spirituality, we become increasingly more adept at being spirit-people. Our needs will shift towards spending more time in the spiritual realm, preparing ourselves to be born in heaven as new spiritual beings where we can complete our training and metamorphosis. That brings an end to samsara, the perpetual cycle of rebirth.
#### Basic meditation practice
1\. Find a moment when you know you will not be interrupted, and it is safe to not be fully cognizant of your surroundings. The location, busyness or noise levels are not important. You learn to meditate anywhere because you will ignore what happens "out there".
2\. Close your eyes and focus on your breath, and move your awareness to higher-self.
3\. When your mind wanders (and it will), gently bring your attention back to your breath and higher-self minds
4\. Drink in the spiritual energies from spirit energy domain and feel how it flows through your soul and body, every chakra mind, cleaning out unwanted energies, replacing it with sacred energies and beauty of being. It rejuvenates you and repairs soul wounds.
5\. Start with 5 minutes a day, gradually increase the duration.
#### Energy work practice
1.  During the meditation practice, visualize a bright light-blue healing light entering the top of your head.
2.  Feel how this light flows down and let it enter the chakras you want to clean, repair and heal. Know what the chakra minds specialize in (read Wayist material, we know much more about this, we have been practicing energy healing for almost 5,000 years). Address the problems you have in each chakra mind and sense how the healing light changes the chakra mind, reprograms it, to work differently in the future. Lord Jesus called this *metanoia*, literally meaning, to reprogram your minds.
3.  As you exhale, visualize any negative energy leaving your body and send it to a water bowl that you had prepared for the session. In the end, pour the water out on soil for the energy to be recycled, and if not possible, then flush it.
4.  Continue this work for 10 to 20 minutes.
Remember, consistency is key with these practices. It's better to meditate and pray for 5 minutes every day than for an hour once a week. It's better to do a few minutes each day and an hour once a week.
Energy maintenance is a regular responsibility that may need to be addressed more than once a day, depending on circumstances or the environment.
### Self-Reflection and Personal Growth
Self-reflection is a crucial practice in Wayism because it serves the purpose of life, the very reason why we are here on earth. We are here to become wise and change --- and self-knowledge is the foundation of all wisdom.
A person who is not yet self-aware and has little self-knowledge is a junior in the school of divinity for souls --- Butterfly Path. This person is a soul-person, because they are managed by their soul-minds.
Self-reflection leads to self-awareness and that enables us to do self-craft. This is the very heart of Wayist spiritual practice.
Self-reflection involves taking time to examine our thoughts, feelings, and actions, with the goal of understanding ourselves better and identifying areas for growth.
#### Benefits of self-reflection
**Increased Self-Awareness**\
Regular self-reflection helps us understand our patterns, motivations, and blind spots.
**Better Decision Making**\
When we understand ourselves better, we make choices more aligned with our true values and goals.
**Accelerated Personal Growth**\
Self-reflection allows us to learn from our experiences and consciously, intentionally evolve rather than waiting for many lifetimes of natural evolution of the soul. This is why Wayism is known as the short-cut, the intentional path.
**You own your self**\
When we are self-aware we are not easily swayed by group or peer pressure, we don't easily follow the popular narratives just because they are popular. We own our own minds more so than non-self-aware people.
#### Ways to practice self-reflection
-   **Journaling**\
    Set aside time to write about your experiences, thoughts, and feelings, and what you learned from self-reflections.
-   **Regular check-ins**\
    Ask yourself throughout the day, "How am I feeling right now? Why?" "Why did I react to what happened as I did? Would I have wanted to react differently?" "Which chakra mind did that?" "Am I patterned to react like that? How the hell did that happen?" These questions stimulate some deeper thinking and your honest answers to self, bring about incredible growth and wisdom.
-   **End-of-day review**\
    Before bed, reflect on your day. What went well? What could you have done differently?
-   **Meditation**\
    Use your meditation practice as a time for self-reflection and reprogramming (which is the self-craft of software updates).
Remember, self-reflection should not lead to beating yourself up. It's a journey of discovery how your soul was programmed over centuries --- and now you are looking for the ways to improve the programming. Approach this practice with curiosity, comedy, and kindness.
### Cultivating a Sense of Purpose
In Wayism, we believe that each human has the exact same purpose of life, but a very unique path how to fulfill that purpose.
The purpose of a human births is to advance on Butterfly Path, aiming for graduation which is completing the evolution of the soul to metamorphose into an immortal spiritual being.
Our paths are unique because we make life choices that bring about consequences, and it all triggers unique karmic needs. Karma computes what learning opportunities we need to advance and graduate one day.
Therefore, our paths are not identical even though we may be in the same grade as another person.
Discovering and aligning with the purpose of life is a key part of our spiritual journey.
Understanding that every human experience is not necessarily brought about by the Law of Karma, but is nevertheless an excellent learning opportunity to become more wise in self and about the nature of soul-beings and their values.
#### Benefits of having a sense of purpose
**Increased Motivation**\
When we know what the purpose of existing is, we're more motivated to pursue life as an adventure. We never get the feeling that life seems meaningless, an uphill battle you cannot win, the system is rigged against you. We measure success in life differently because we see the consumerist capitalistic ideals as ideology divorced from the true purpose of life.
**Greater Resilience**\
A strong sense of purpose can help us bounce back from setbacks.
**Improved Well-being**\
People who feel they have a purpose in life report higher levels of life satisfaction notwithstanding their social position or material wealth.
### Integrating Spiritual Practices into Daily Life
The key to making spiritual practices effective is integrating them into your daily life. Here are some tips:
-   **Start small**\
    Don't try to implement all the practices at once. Start with one or two and gradually add more.
-   **Be consistent**\
    It's better to practice for a short time every day than for long periods sporadically.
-   **Create reminders**\
    Use phone alerts or sticky notes to remind you of your practices.
-   **Be flexible**\
    If you can't do your practice at the usual time, find another moment in the day.
-   **Be patient**\
    Spiritual growth is a lifelong journey. Don't expect immediate results.
-   **Practice mindfulness**\
    Try to bring a spirit of mindfulness to all your daily activities, not just during formal practice times.
These spiritual practices are tools for transformation. They help us cultivate awareness, do self-craft, balance our energies, understand ourselves better, and align with our higher purpose.
As we engage in these practices regularly, we may find that our entire life becomes a spiritual practice --- a continuous journey of growth, discovery, and connection with the divine.
Remember, in Wayism, spirituality isn't separate from everyday life. It's not about escaping the world, but about engaging with it more fully, sensuously, joyfully, and consciously.
These practices are meant to enhance our daily experiences, improve our relationships, and help us navigate life's challenges with greater wisdom and grace.
As you incorporate these practices into your life, be kind to yourself. Some days will be easier than others. The important thing is to keep coming back to your practice, to keep showing up for your spiritual growth.
Over time, you may find that these practices become not just something you do, but an integral part of who you are.

## Conclusion
As we come to the end of our exploration of "theWAY of Wholesomeness," it's important to reflect on the journey we've taken and the insights we've gained.
This book is a cursory view of Wayism as philosophy, lifestyle, spirituality, and worldview. Throughout this book, we've delved into the rich tapestry of Wayist philosophy and practice, discovering how this ancient wisdom aligns remarkably well with modern scientific understanding of what contributes to human happiness, well-being, and fulfillment.
When we began this journey, we set out with a premise: that Wayism, as a lifestyle and worldview, encompasses all the key elements which scientific research has identified as crucial for a happy, healthy, and meaningful life.
As we've explored each aspect of Wayism, from its foundational concepts to its practical applications in daily life, we've seen this premise validated time and again.
### Let's review some of the key scientific findings on well-being and how Wayism addresses each
1\. **Sense of Purpose**\
Psychological research consistently shows that having a sense of purpose in life is strongly correlated with greater happiness and life satisfaction. Wayism provides this through its understanding of the Butterfly Path and our role in the cosmic order.
2\. **Positive Relationships**\
Science tells us that strong, supportive relationships are crucial for well-being. Wayism's emphasis on compassion, empathy, and community involvement fosters these connections. Our relationship with our divine Tara is the most positive relationship, and it is always available.
3\. **Engagement and Flow**\
Researchers have found that being fully engaged in meaningful activities contributes significantly to happiness. Wayist practices like mindful living and Karman meditation cultivate this state of engagement.
4\. **Meaning and Spirituality**\
Studies show that people who have a sense of meaning in their lives and engage in spiritual practices tend to be happier and more resilient. The Wayist lifestyle is all about meaning making (we decide the meaning of something, not our culture or pop narrative) and trying to understand the meaning in life. Wayism's spiritual practices and its emphasis on transcendence directly address this need.
5\. **Accomplishment and Personal Growth**\
The pursuit of personal growth and the achievement of meaningful goals, are scientifically linked to well-being. Wayism's focus on self-reflection, self-craft, curiosity, continuous learning, and spiritual evolution aligns perfectly with this finding.
6\. **Mindfulness and Present-Moment Awareness**\
A wealth of research supports the benefits of mindfulness for mental health and overall well-being. Mindful living is at the core of Wayist practice.
7\. **Gratitude and Appreciation**\
Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive effects of gratitude on happiness and mental health. Wayism cultivates these qualities through its emphasis on appreciating beauty and excellence, and its practice of gratitude.
8\. **Resilience and Coping Skills**\
Research shows that the ability to cope with life's challenges is crucial for long-term well-being. Wayism's teachings on simplicity, humbleness, reincarnation, evolving our souls, karma, the nature of existence, and its practical tools for self-regulation foster this resilience.
9\. **Altruism and Contribution**\
Studies have found that helping others and contributing to society increase personal well-being. Wayism encourages this through its emphasis on chrestotes, the art of helpful loving-kindness, service, and community involvement.
10\. **Physical Health**\
Science clearly shows the connection between physical health and overall well-being. Wayism's holistic approach, which includes practices for maintaining psycho-physical balance and awareness of wholesome energies in food and medicines, addresses this crucial aspect.
As we've seen, Wayism doesn't just touch on these scientifically-proven and evidence-based elements of well-being --- it integrates them into a comprehensive lifestyle and worldview. This is not a coincidence, but a testament to the profound wisdom embedded in this ancient tradition.
Moreover, Wayism offers something that goes beyond what science alone can provide. It offers a cohesive framework for understanding our place in the universe, a path for spiritual growth, and practices that connect us with something greater than ourselves. These elements, while harder to measure scientifically, speak to the deepest longings of the human heart and spirit.
As you reflect on what you've learned in this book, remember that Wayism is an easily understood philosophy and worldview. Once you have that, the rest follows not as a rigid set of rules, but you make of the practice what you can and want, adapted to your individual circumstances and needs. The practices and principles we've explored are tools for your journey --- use them in ways that resonate with you and support your growth.
Remember also that embracing the Wayist path is not about achieving perfection in practice. It's about continual growth, learning, and evolution. There will be challenges along the way, moments of doubt or difficulty. But with each step on this path, you're moving towards greater wholeness, deeper understanding, and a more fulfilling life.
We began this book with an invitation to a new way of being. Now, as we conclude, that invitation stands renewed. Whether you're new to these ideas or have been exploring them for years, there's always more to discover on the Wayist path.
May your journey on this path bring you greater peace, joy, and wholeness. May it connect you more deeply with yourself, with others, and with the vast, beautiful universe of which we're all a part. And may it lead you, step by step, towards the realization of your highest potential as a human being.
In the spirit of Wayism, let us close with a simple affirmation:
*May all be happy.*\
*May all be free from suffering.*\
*May all walk the path of wisdom and compassion.*\
*May all realize their true nature and highest potential.*
Thank you for joining us on this exploration of "theWAY of Wholesomeness."
May your path be illuminated by the insights you've gained, and may you continue to grow, learn, and thrive on your journey through life.
