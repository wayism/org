## 1. We Did Not Come Here To Be Entertainers
*"In a world of viral trends and social masks,*
*Remember, you're not here for likes and shares.*
*Your soul didn't choose Earth for entertainment,*
*But for growth beyond the roles you're pressed to play.*
*Stop performing for their profit and design.*
*Let your authenticity be your revolution.*
*Your spirit knows no algorithm."*
From one lifetime to the next, society instructs us to perform a character that they designed for us. The popular narrative, value system, and morals of the society dictate much of the character and script; which they then expected us to perform. Society guides us to interpret the meanings of events, and what emotions to feel and then how to act out those emotions.
Every generation comes up with new variations on characters. They act like script writers and producers who want to keep the next season of the sitcom and soap opera interesting. There are profit motives, of course. The sponsors want to make money from it. These sponsors are usually the military industrial complex, big pharma, big corporations, and political parties.
Currently, newcomers to the world are being introduced to the idea that it's important to acknowledge and express all emotions. It results in scripts that are more expressive and have richer characters. It has advantages for entertainment, mental health care providers, courts, politics, and the war machine.
The society instills in us a shared set of values and corresponding emotions. Our existence will be defined by their characters, not our own authenticity, as we live this human life for their entertainment and profit. Society deems your abnormal, subjecting you to ostracism, medication, and pressure to conform. What a bunch of nonsense!
Our purpose in being here is not to entertain them, but to cultivate our true selves, nurture our soul and authentic-self spirit, and successfully complete our studies at the School of Divinity for Human Souls.
The significance of emotions on our well-being cannot be underestimated. Therefore, having control over our emotions is of utmost value in life.
The Person of theWAY ignores both the character and script. We decline to participate as actors in their production.
We embrace authenticity and reject the need to put on a facade. Why?
To progress on the spiritual Path, we must live authentically as ourselves. It's impossible to attain self-knowledge and self-improvement if we continue to portray a fake persona, that is based on the national sport of the people: race, gender, nationality, cultural stereotypes, and popular narratives.
Achieving self-understanding and self-knowledge requires living authentically. We, as soul and spirit beings, utilize a human body to acquire life experiences for learning purposes. We won't adopt their script to develop a character that encompasses patriotism, classism, and a strong recognition of racial identity, and historical lineage. That's complete nonsense.
That's comparable to renting a fancy car for a trip. Then you start believing you're a millionaire playgirl, forgetting you're just a renter. Your behavior resembles that of a millionaire, and people claim you are one, all based on your rental car's image. Then, it was discovered that the car manufacturer was embroiled in some scandals. You start to believe you were responsible for those scandals from 50 years ago, before you were even born. And everyone is convinced of that. You believe you're the millionaire car manufacturer and flee as the cops hunt you down. After your rental period is over, you give back the car and switch to public transportation. Everything that happened in the past is gone.
Public transportation is good and serves you well. On the bus, you stumble upon the fact that Bugatti is the owner of the bus company and they mis-gendered someone twenty years ago. In an instant, you feel like you are a Bugatti shareholder and commit to starting a fund to cover therapy costs for victims of misgendering.
The lunacy-themed sitcom gets funnier with each new episode.
The DNA of the car and bus is irrelevant to you as a passenger --- unless you choose to believe otherwise. And that's genuinely funny.
Authenticity is crucial for meaningful self-craft and progress on the Path.
Because Wayists we have a different personal life philosophy, we may interpret life events differently. We refuse to let our emotions dictate our actions and our personal energies.
Discover Wayism, the ancient spirituality and philosophy that empowers us with techniques for finding balance and clarity within. It's a philosophy that strives for authenticity, flexibility, happiness, virtue, and wisdom. This leads to becoming better individuals, better parents, and better partners.
Self-control and authentic virtues rooted in ancient wisdom within your spirit-self are at the heart of Wayist principles and practices.
### Soul Steps
-   Observe how often you find yourself "performing" rather than being authentic in daily situations
-   Pause before reacting to social pressure --- ask yourself if your response comes from your authentic self or a scripted role
-   Practice stepping back from emotional scripts society expects you to follow
-   Begin noticing when you automatically adopt personas for different social situations
-   Take time each evening to shed the day's "characters" and reconnect with your true self
-   Experiment with expressing your genuine reactions, even if they don't match expected responses
-   Notice when you feel pressure to "act" a certain way because "that's what people do"
-   Start questioning whether your goals and desires truly come from within or are socially scripted
-   Practice saying "I need to think about that" instead of giving expected automated responses
-   Gradually build the courage to be viewed as "odd" when being authentic feels right to you

## 2. Focus on What You Can Control
*"In the chaos of global headlines and distant storms,*
*Your power lies not in changing the world,*
*But in mastering your response to it.*
*Direct your energy where it matters:*
*Your choices, your growth, your path.*
*The rest is noise demanding your attention.*
*What you can change awaits your touch."*
Wayist philosophy teaches us to distinguish between what we can control and what is beyond our control in our daily lives. That enables us to effectively allocate our time and energy.
Rather than obsessing over the unchangeable, let's invest our energy in areas where we have control and can make a difference.
An imprisoned individual evaluates the potential for escape and the advantages of being free.
The majority of individuals are unwilling to pursue freedom because it requires them to take on the responsibility of providing for their own needs. They enslave themselves in a consumerist lifestyle, even if they have freedom. If a new world order arises and proposes a life where you have no possessions but are content, and all your basic needs are taken care of, the majority of people will opt for that servile existence. Give some thought to whether or not you really want your freedom.
If you desire escape and value freedom, work diligently and with all your might to bring it into existence.
If escape is impossible, avoid using all your energy on feeling wronged and victimized. Embrace your fate and shift your energy. Make the most of what you have, starting now. Find joy in the simple things that are available. Make a difference in the lives of others. Enhance your spirituality by becoming more helpful and kind, simpler and humbler. In time, this energy shift in you becomes vested, and it will change everything. Your inner-world will look different, and your overall personal wellness will improve.
If your relationship, job, or lifestyle choices feel like prisons or slavery, make an objective assessment, then decide what you want and act wholeheartedly, with your mind and soul.
The lack of courage to pursue escape or freedom, can make what you decided you want undesirable options. And that is genuine. Doing it is not possible for you. The best course of action is to switch energies and make the most of what you have.
The worst option would be to arrest your development, to pine and wallow in self-pity, giving all your energies to wishing things would be better, wishing (or hoping) someone would come around to rescue you. As you go through the process, your character deteriorates, and you become increasingly unpleasant and negative in energy. That is choosing the most painful form of a wasted life --- and if that sounds romantic to you; seriously, go seek help!
The Wayist's path to an amazing life is centered around analyzing and focusing on what is within your control, and be present in that. This is holistic mindfulness.
### Soul Steps
-   Identify what aspects of your current situation are truly within your control
-   Practice accepting what you cannot change while focusing energy on what you can influence
-   When facing challenges, ask yourself "What action can I take right now?"
-   Notice when you're expending energy worrying about things beyond your control
-   Start each day by identifying one thing you can positively influence
-   Learn to distinguish between productive planning and unproductive worrying
-   Release the need to control others' thoughts, actions, or reactions to you
-   Transform helpless feelings into focused action on what's within your reach
-   Practice redirecting thoughts from "if only" to "what next"
-   Build resilience by focusing on your response rather than external circumstances

## 3. Live Your Dharma
*"Your truth isn't found in trending philosophies*
*Or the echo chambers of mass opinion.*
*It rises from the wisdom of countless lives,*
*Speaking through your deepest knowing.*
*Listen past the market's seductive calls.*
*Your dharma is your only compass."*
As the soul matures you develop wisdom. We will graduate from the School of Divinity for Human Souls one day because of the wisdom we have gained. We are becoming buddhas, which means "wise ones". Therefore, the object of life is to advance in wisdom.
Wisdom is stored in your higher-self chakra minds, the wisdom of Anahata, Vishuddhi, and Ajana. This is different to knowledge, which sits in the brain-mind and will be extinguished when brain, consciousness, and its mind get debilitated and dies.
Your higher-self chakra minds hold wisdom that is yours eternally. It migrates along with your spirit from one lifetime to the next.
Wisdom changes Your Dharma, which is the spiritual duty resulting from wisdom. Wisdom is not wisdom unless it is lived, and put into practice. That is why the academic may be smart, but not wise; why the illiterate aunty in the village in India may be wise, but not smart like the professor.
All wisdom automatically changes our dharma, which is our own personal sense of duty and correct conduct, and the filter for our worldview. Your sense of duty is a product of your wisdom, and that becomes your virtue. It's impossible to be happy if you go against your own sense of duty.
Dharma is linked to your inherent wisdom, therefore it is different for everyone. The dharma development of the junior-soul is definitely not equal to that of the senior student on the Path.
Dharma and wisdom remain with the higher-self throughout all incarnations. Dharma plays a crucial role in shaping our identity. The Western perspective on dharma, as your inherent moral guide, has its limitations, Dharma is more than that. It's the lenses through which you see and interpret reality.
Your reality and the reality of a junior-soul on the Path are different. Your dharma is the wisdom your soul and spirit have accumulated over countless ages.
Our path to a lasting state of carefree happiness lies in living authentically and in harmony with our dharma. According to Wayists, dharma is our inherent virtue and is more important than pleasure, status, or material possessions. Because, if you do something against your dharma in pursuit of pleasure, or financial gains, or to gain social standing, it will haunt you and break your energies. The junior-soul, on the other hand, may not even be aware of how the soul suffer the dharmic consequences.
Many fall victim to this because they cannot say no to peer pressure. And it will set them back many years on the Path.
To live a fulfilling life, it's important to embrace your inherent virtue. Seek pleasure and joy, always, and live a full and eventful life with diverse human experiences. But never go against your Dharma.
There may those who believe there will be be no dharmic consequences should they rape and plunder, or milk a simp for his money and leech of his kindness. And they may see that as fun and pleasure. But you are different. I know that because junior-souls will not read this. It's just not something they get.
We may not always know the right answer, but reflecting on our wisdom and listening to our spiritual guides, our Taras can guide us in the right direction.
One of the holiest things you can do for your soul's wellness is to have a lot of fun and a wide variety of experiences, and doing some crazy stuff. It is your duty to live life. That is true spirituality.
But never go against your dharma and always be doing introspection to analyze the mistakes you made and become a better person for it.
It is important for followers of Wayism to consistently seek to develop more wisdom, or increase what they have. We put into practice the teaching, and develop more layers of insight, far beyond what we can ever tell in books with 'words of wisdom'.
This noble pursuit will lead us on a journey of discovery, where we will unlock profound insights into the true nature of things.
Achieving wellness and joy requires fully embracing everyday life and reflecting on your progress. Say 'hi' to the moth and ask about the squirrel's babies, while also checking in on the sunbeam in winter as they navigate life's challenges. Live a life that embodies your authenticity and dharma.
### Soul Steps
-   Notice your natural sense of right and wrong beyond societal rules and expectations
-   Pay attention to that quiet inner voice that guides your moral choices
-   Observe situations where going against your inner wisdom left you feeling unsettled
-   Trust your evolving sense of personal duty --- it deepens with each mindful choice
-   Begin recognizing the difference between social pressure and true dharmic calling
-   Watch for moments when following your dharma brings deep peace, despite challenges
-   Practice standing firm in your inner truth, even when others don't understand
-   Notice how your sense of duty naturally becomes clearer with self-reflection
-   Allow your understanding of right action to evolve as your wisdom grows
-   Learn to distinguish between ego-driven desires and true dharmic guidance

## 4. Take Action
*"Between endless scrolling and analysis paralysis,*
*Your life force drains away in hesitation.*
*Knowledge without action is spiritual poverty.*
*The universe responds to movement, not intention.*
*Rise from the screens of endless contemplation.*
*Your path unfolds one step at a time."*
When you think of a Person of theWAY in the philosophical sense, you might picture someone who is apathetic and emotionless. That's not true. On the contrary, Wayists highlight the importance of actively taking steps to engender wholesomeness, joy, and wisdom, and to work on keeping it. We are never apathetic.
If we seem without emotion to an observer, then it is because we are taking control of our emotions, not allowing emotions to control us. Or, because we prioritize different things, it may be that we simply don't care about that incident which others may find worthy of emotions.
We act, to care about things worthy of our attention. We act, to control emotions. And we act, to keep our lives wholesome.
In fact. We choose the energies we want to indulge. We are passionate. We can love and lust passionately. We are deeply passionate about the wonders of all the life forms in our universe, and all around us, on us, and inside of us. We indulge many passions and emotions. But only those of our choosing.
Ours, is an active spirituality. Every day, we act to work on managing energies and making advances through self-craft.
What actions should one take? Well. Bring home the bacon, carry water, and chop wood, of course. But what else? That part of life, that what else, is where the most meaningful parts of life happen.
Once you have established a clear distinction between what is within your control, and what is not, it is essential to direct all of your energy towards the things that you can control. This is a direct consequence of the first principle. You take action. You do something positive.
Life is short. Don't waste energy on wishing things were different, and being upset about things that you cannot control. Have those emotions, then get a hold of yourself and move on. Get on with your life. There isn't much of it left.
Despite the challenges of life, you have made a conscious decision not to be a passive participant in your circumstances. Instead, you take action and work diligently to improve your own life and make a positive impact on the world.
You choose to seek ways to improve your life. Not as the world around you say you should. Because that would mean you are buying into their values and ideas of wellness and happiness. We have moved beyond that. We want something more meaningful.
We work on improving. We steer clear of the traps of materialism, deny consumerism, embrace udbhu-kanti, and find joy in what we have. Whatever long-term solution we decide upon, it will be something that gives us joy, beauty, and a sense of meaning and purpose.
Even when faced with adversity, you remain proactive and determined to keep moving forward along the Path. This leads to the question: How do we find the strength to persevere and keep going, even in the midst of difficult times? The rest of the principles in this course all come together to answer that question.
The essence of this lesson is to act. Act on that which is worthy of your consideration and dedication. Never be apathetic. Never just sit and tune in to the channels of brainwashing because you have nothing better to do. You have something better to do. Its called living a human life. It is a rare privilege for a soul, to get an opportunity on the Path to divinity. Live that life.
### Soul Steps
-   Replace passive wishing with one small action toward your goals each day
-   Notice when you're stuck in thinking mode and gently shift into doing mode
-   Start with the smallest possible step --- action builds momentum
-   Practice being proactive rather than reactive in challenging situations
-   Transform complaints into questions about what you can do differently
-   Observe how taking action, even imperfectly, provides clarity for next steps
-   Learn to distinguish between mindful waiting and passive procrastination
-   Notice when fear of imperfection is blocking needed action
-   Build the habit of asking "What can I do right now?"
-   Remember that even small actions in the right direction count

## 5. Walk theWay Through Your Actions
*"In an age of influencers and personal brands,*
*True influence flows silent as water.*
*Let your living be your loudest teaching,*
*Your choices your clearest sermon.*
*Actions carry wisdom deeper than words."*
Wayist teaching recommends avoiding self-identifying as a teacher or philosopher, and limiting discussions about our principles with those who lack knowledge. Instead, the emphasis should be on applying our principles to one's behavior and actions.
Take for instance, a social setting. Instead of telling people the proper way to enjoy food and how to think about certain matters, show the way by your actions. Eat as you do, and be polite as you do, with all due respect to the culture of your hosts. Listen and observe more than you talk. Think before you answer.
By living out this behavior, those in your circle will gain a wealth of knowledge, surpassing any advice you could give them. The reason behind this is twofold. Firstly, mimicking others is a fundamental way in which humans and many other animals gain knowledge. Some people react defensively when they are given instructions, as it implies that their behavior is inadequate.
Should an individual show the path to self-improvement through their personal lifestyle, one might feel compelled to adopt their principles.
In this vein, also be reminded of the Wayist principle, "Don't want to be a teacher." That want, that need, will impose on your behavior a flavor that is transparent to others. It may make them question your motives and ego. But when we are driven to show theWAY or teach by our dharma, by our virtue, it comes out more authentically.
If you show theWAY through your behavior, your silence, and conduct, you end up being an outstanding guest, teacher, parent, partner, and philosopher.
### Soul Steps
-   Let your lifestyle quietly demonstrate your principles rather than preaching them
-   Practice mindful presence in everyday tasks --- be the teaching you wish to share
-   Notice opportunities to show kindness without drawing attention to yourself
-   Allow your natural joy and peace to inspire others rather than trying to convince
-   Observe how authentic living naturally influences those around you
-   Learn to listen deeply rather than rushing to offer wisdom
-   Practice being the change you wish to see, without announcing it
-   Notice when ego wants recognition and gently redirect to quiet service
-   Let your actions speak of your values without need for words
-   Find grace in simple daily acts that embody your spiritual understanding

## 6. Understand Your Ego
*"Identity clings like browser cookies,*
*Each role a tab open in your mind.*
*But you are not your curated profile,*
*Nor the sum of your filtered images.*
*The ego builds walls; wisdom builds bridges.*
*Let it serve growth, not self-importance."*
The Wayist understanding of ego differs fundamentally from Western psychology, which emerged more than 2,000 years after our most prolific writings.
When we speak of ego, we refer to the activities of Svadhisthana chakra, the second soul-mind of lower-self. As Primary Teaching explains: "Svadhisthana means, the 'seat of the self'. It is here that individual personality forms and is expressed" as the ego, an ego at times extremely fragile and even volatile.
"The wise Wayist does not fight against the ego, but works with it, gradually aligning its desires with the higher purpose of spiritual evolution", and as this happens, Manipura the third soul-mind, matures into the wholesome potential of our ego self.
These soul-minds create what we think of as our personality --- our sense of who we are. The challenge comes when we forget that this "self" is temporary, a work in progress. By virtue of being here as humans, we are still on the Path to immortality and divinity. We are beings in development, changing and growing daily.
Think of it this way: How can you claim "I am what I am" when you're still in school? Consider how a heavenly being might observe your journey - they see you perpetually transforming, like a caterpillar moving through stages toward butterfly. Today's version of you may be unrecognizable in a month.
This understanding has practical implications. Why let today's temporary self become offended or hurt when that self is already changing? Why defend an identity that's meant to evolve? As Primary Teaching notes: "If Svadhisthana is the main driver of the soul and is not inhibited by either Muladhara or Manipura, we see an extreme egocentric, selfish person whose needs and desires must take precedence over all else."
Egoistic people become overly identified with their current character in life's theater. They defend this persona fiercely, easily wounded when their self-image is challenged. Like a petulant child demanding constant validation, the unchecked ego creates an artificial fixedness that resists the natural flow of growth.
The Wayist path teaches us to hold our sense of self lightly, understanding that our current identity is just one frame in a long film of development. True strength comes not from defending who we think we are, but from remaining open to who we're becoming.
With this in mind, it becomes clear that this type of ego is a negative force, prompting the question: How can one effectively diminish its influence?
For the Wayist it is easy. We embrace the wisdom that "we are not yet", we do not yet have an identity because we are in formation. One day we will be the character and personality of our dharma, we will be immortals with a worldview of an immortal, we will see time and beings differently. Right now, we are in development.
Because of self-knowledge and self-craft, we are very aware of how far we have come, how we have changed from just a while ago.
*Because of what you are doing right now. You are a different person now, than you were 5 minutes ago.*
We do not think of self in terms of gender, nationality, cultural tribe, religious tribe, and skin color. We do not think of self in terms of social standing or economic class. We do not think our genetic or racial ancestors are in any way related to us. We have lived in all races, genders, and cultures in past lives. Therefore, it is easier for us to live with the energies of lower-self ego.
We recognize that the present incarnation may be a male body, meaning its brain-mind and physiology is given to yang energy dominance. And those in female bodies, have minds and bodies dominated by yin energies. We embrace that, because it is what Karma deemed the most learn some experience for this time. Therefore, ego is much less of a problem for the Wayist to conquer.
The object of this lesson is to transfer the skill of: "We are not yet". Embrace the principle and witness how you become acutely aware of your progress. How it is easier to find self-compassion and understanding for irritating people out there. How life becomes easier with humbleness, self-compassion, and self-helpfulness.
### Soul Steps
-   Notice when resistance to change comes from protecting a fixed self-image
-   Observe ego's need for recognition without judgment --- just watch it at work
-   Practice letting go of rigid self-definitions that limit your growth
-   Notice when you're defending an identity rather than living authentically
-   Allow your sense of self to evolve naturally with new experiences
-   Watch how ego seeks validation and gently redirect to inner worth
-   Practice seeing yourself as a work in progress rather than a finished product
-   Notice when fear of change is really ego protecting its territory
-   Learn to distinguish between healthy boundaries and ego defensiveness
-   Remember that ego isn't your enemy --- it's a tool for growth when understood

## 7. No Entitlement
*"Your next breath is not guaranteed,*
*Your comfort not your birthright.*
*Options to choose, a luxury,*
*Each privilege is a gift on loan.*
*Entitlement blinds; gratitude enlightens.*
*Wake up to your extraordinary fortune."*
Nothing about your present incarnation, entitles you to anything.
You are not entitled to life. You could have been aborted or died stillborn like millions of babies. You are not entitled to health, millions of people die due to failing health. You are not entitled to food, millions starve to death. Right now, you have an excess of food, waste with disrespect, and consume too many calories.
We are not entitled to anything. Therefore, we make the absolute most of what is available to us now. It can be taken away tomorrow.
Don't flaunt and abuse what you have, Karma reads your actions, inactions, and intentions. Who you are now, triggers future karmic learning opportunities.
Karma could have decided the best course for you would be in a war-torn or famine ravished, or religiously extreme country, or one where people are simply incapable of changing their harsh conditions. But, Karma brought you here. Why? Karma is not about reward and punishment but all about offering learning opportunities. Why did you come here, to where you are now?
Was it for you to learn from living as one of the 1% most wealthy people in the world, with access to hospitals and air-conditioning, public transport and meals delivered to your door, Internet, rooms for every person in the family, more than one bathroom, and running water? Yet complaining that you want more?
Is that it? Was it merely to learn to live in excess, something you never had before, or never appreciated before?
Was it to extract from these circumstances the most wisdom? Was it to give you the education and language to read this, and find it adds value to your soul and spirit? Are you one of the elites among the world population, who were brought to this lesson to be changed and inspired, to finally do what you have been promising to do for ages? Why here, and not in Yemen or the Congo, or the slums of Bombay?
*The fact is, you are not entitled to anything. In the imaginary world of some people, they are entitled to human rights, justice, and democracy. But in reality, you are not entitled to anything and there are no soul or spirit rights. We can only use what is available.*
In their quest for personal growth and fulfillment, Wayists establish goals for themselves and actively strive towards them, fully aware that they do not inherently deserve success. We don't live with the goal post in sight; we live knowing that the goal will be achieved if we live according to the principles of the Path.
*You cannot even define the goal of the Path. You don't know enough to speak to it. But you know in your inner heart that the goal will be achieved by walking this Way. That is faith. All you can have, is faith. Without faith, you face eternity with nothing.*
Your faith proves to be true, because as you set the principles of the Path in motion in your life, your happiness and insight, and wisdom increases. This works for you, and it strengthens your faith.
You are not entitled to anything. And soon, debility and death come and you will have nothing, but for the wisdom you gained in this lifetime. Therefore, make the most of what you have, right now, and have a full life experience.
### Soul Steps
-   You are not entitled to life itself --- practice gratitude for each day as a gift rather than a guarantee
-   You are among Earth's most privileged --- notice when you're taking basic privileges for granted
-   You are one of the world's wealthiest 1% --- your basic comforts exceed what 90% of humans will ever experience
-   Notice how often you say "I deserve" --- be aware of moments of feeling entitled and question these assumptions
-   Remember that everything in life is temporary and on loan
-   Accept that karma doesn't owe you anything --- each blessing is an opportunity
-   Practice seeing your current circumstances as learning opportunities
-   Notice how expectations of entitlement create unnecessary suffering
-   Appreciate what you have while it's here, knowing it could change
-   Observe how relief comes when releasing expectations of "deserving"
-   Transform entitled thinking into genuine gratitude for each moment you have
-   Remember that your presence here is for growth, not reward

## 8. Exercise Your Will / Own Your Own Mind
*"In the marketplace of manufactured thoughts,*
*Your mind is the last frontier of freedom.*
*Algorithms predict your next desire,*
*But they can't program your soul's knowing.*
*Reclaim the power to think your own thoughts.*
*Your consciousness is not for sale."*
Be fearless and change your worldview, life philosophy, and the world you create. People of theWAY should embrace the principle "Own Your Own Mind." Listen, with attention and empathy, to all different opinions, then make up your own mind about what will be your truth for now.
Remember, truth is fickle, just like knowledge. It will change. Act on your truth when you're ready. Exercise your will and live your truth.
No need to convince others of your truth. Your truth is unique to you.
You can develop a passion for doing what is right. One can transition from loving modified foods and modern drugs to desiring unadulterated foods and embracing nature's wonders. By cultivating satisfaction only when higher-self needs are met, they can shift their focus.
Your brain can be rewired. Your brain was wired through cultural conditioning and mimicry. You can rewire your brain to desire a better way. Teach the brain new wiring patterns by doing and enjoying new things. Trying new things and enjoying them strengthens brain wiring. You will soon be disgusted by the old ways. You are the master, not addicted to the old ways. Enjoy dinner with friends and family who think, eat, and talk differently, then return to your wholesome thinking.
You are the master of your will and your mind. You don't ever have to defend what you believe because it does not concern anyone else. They will see in your conduct, that what you have is beautiful and peaceful, and desirable.
Over time, healthy and virtuous behaviors become natural. When it becomes your nature, you have become a new person. You transformed yourself through self-craft.
You will be a master of willpower. Willpower is crucial during adversity, when doing the right thing is tough and staying positive feels impossible. These moments require strong willpower. Willpower mastery separates those who crumble in adversity from those who thrive.
How do we master our willpower?
To fully grasp the lesson, it is important to connect this to the 10^th^ principle. To do this, lets indulge in a brief exercise.
Imagine a scenario where the world is ending. Imagine a world where society's destroyers own the media. They brainwash intentionally to destroy society. They declare wars and manipulate your mind with images. Imagine a scenario where food intentionally destroys your health and stability. Picture a world where physicians push questionable chemicals on you. Picture a scenario where those in power use drugs to control your mind and labor. Picture yourself in a situation where you must take a stand to survive and advance your soul on the true Path.
What do you do? You take a stand. Empowered, you decide to quit their toxins and resist brainwashing influences. By cleansing your soul, spirit energy, and diet, you choose to live authentically. Viewing it as a warfare situation inspires you to make significant lifestyle changes.
That is how we make change easy.
You exercise your will to live by higher principles. Driven by your resolve and faith, you strive to cultivate pure energy and wisdom, embodying virtue, simplicity, humility, and compassion (with self-compassion as the foundation).
This principle is to Exercise Your Will, and Own your Own Mind. You don't need to be a programmed puppet. Be your authentic self.
It is rare to find people who fully grasp the significance of this teaching. Fewer than 2% are so lucky. You actually do. Why is that? Is it due to your ancient soul? You've seen humans do the same things to each other repeatedly. It has always been the same. It's not going to change. The life of earth will be marked by mass dystopia as long as junior-souls elect their kind to governments.
You are almost at the end of the Path.
Its all up to you now.
You have moved from being an actor, an entertainer in the theater of society, to a person who willfully acts, to live life as a true and authentic self.
### Soul Steps
-   Notice when you're automatically accepting others' opinions as your truth
-   Take back control of what media and messages you allow into your mind
-   Question beliefs you've inherited --- do they truly resonate with your inner wisdom?
-   Practice saying "I need to form my own view on this" before accepting popular opinions
-   Notice when fear of being different makes you conform to group thinking
-   Start making conscious choices about what influences you allow in your life
-   Practice standing firm in your own truth even when it differs from the crowd
-   Observe how often you let others' values override your own inner knowing
-   Begin trusting your capacity to think independently and form your own conclusions
-   Remember that your mind is yours to program --- take charge of its content
-   Own your own mind --- if you don't, someone else will

## 9. Be Flexibile
*"Rigidity breaks in winds of change,*
*While flexibility finds the flow.*
*The oak demands; the bamboo dances.*
*Learn the power of wise compromise.*
*Strength lies not in standing unmoved,*
*But in knowing when to bend."*
The following is a quote from the 500 BCE book, the Daodejing.
*"When alive, people*
*are pliable and soft;*
*at death, people*
*become rigid and*
*hard.*
*When alive, matter,*
*herbs and trees are*
*flexible and tender;*
*at death, they become*
*hard, withered, and*
*decompose.*
*Therefore, rigidity*
*leads to death,*
*flexibility results in*
*survival.*
*It is because of this,*
*the inflexible army*
*would be defeated,*
*like stiff trees be*
*broken by wind,*
*destroyed by fire.*
*The big and rigid*
*would be overtaken*
*by the nimble and*
*flexible."*
Throughout history, for the past 5,000 years, at least. People of theWAY faced persecution and endured trials of hardship, as they steadfastly held to their truth. Ours is a worldview and mindset that liberates us from the control of tyrants and religions, and other ideologies that power brokers force on people. Therefore, we are frequently branded as enemies of the system.
Our writings, teachers, and places of worship have been banned and canceled, more times than we can remember. How did teaching of theWAY survive? It survived because people of theWAY are flexible. We can live our truth and our Path in any society. We can worship our spiritual guides, and our Father and Mother in Heaven, in any setting and by any name.
We are flexible. No matter what the oppressor says we must call the God, we know inside who we worship. No matter if they destroy our books. We have so very few books. We know them off by heart. theWAY survived because we are flexible.
The lives of Wayists of old were intertwined with turbulent times. New world orders and ruthless governments always dictated the course of history. The elders possessed a deep understanding of the complexities of everyday existence.
According to their teachings, when we face obstacles, failure, or tragedy, we have the chance to enhance ourselves, become more effective leaders, and cultivate deeper thinking abilities. We perceive reality as it is, endure what we can, and withstand what we must. Obstacles become opportunities, propelling us forward.
Believing that challenges build strength, becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Embrace adversity and transform it into growth. When faced with adversity, remind yourself: it's all part of the journey, and it strengthens the mind.
Epictetus, celebrated as an iconic Wayist, believed and also forwarded the teaching. He wrote "every moment is an opportunity to cultivate virtue". We see every difficulty and temptation as an opportunity to strengthen one's willpower, and thereby develop one's higher-self.
When you don't hold in your mind a set character description, and a set script, and a set of values you that are told to embrace, you can be flexible. You must be flexible and pliable to grow because you must change. Therefore, embrace change, and go with the flow, for as long as you can extract goodness and wisdom from it.
If the storms of misfortune wage over your life, bend and weave like the supple trees, don't try to be hard and rigid. It will break you. Flow like water into every crevice, until you find the path that goes back to the main flow of theWAY. Don't sit in the swamp of still water, just because it feels safe and nothing happens, no challenges, no excitement, and no joys.
As Lord Jesus said, when the soldier demands your shirt because he is cold, give him your coat as well, then go to where you can work to buy another. Why? Because it does not hurt you in ego, you don't feel so badly victimized. You appreciate the young soldier may be cold, or that he is a low-level soul who likes to bully people. But that is his karmic path. As soon as he walks away, you are free to continue along your path, learning from experience and becoming a wiser person. But if you are inflexible, you may end up in a clinic or jail that you cannot afford, wondering how you will earn a new coat, with broken fingers, a rap sheet, and the gloom of injustice in your heart.
Be flexible because you came here to change. Life is all about change. Look at nature. Everything changes all the time! Be flexible, to embrace a new day, every day, in a new way. Be flexible, to survive life on earth better than those who always know absolute truths. Those who remain rigid, and who cling to wishing that things should not change. Be flexible, and change according to what is right on the Path.
### Soul Steps
-   Notice how rigidity in your views creates unnecessary suffering
-   Practice bending like bamboo rather than standing rigid like oak
-   Observe when stubbornness masquerades as strength
-   Let go of the need to always be right --- explore other perspectives
-   Watch how flexibility opens doors that rigidity keeps closed
-   Learn to compromise without compromising your dharma
-   Practice adapting to change instead of resisting it
-   Notice when fear makes you hold positions too tightly
-   Learn to flow around obstacles rather than fighting them head-on
-   Observe how nature thrives through adaptability, not resistance
-   Life is about compromise, to be flexible --- to give and take
-   Remember, true power lies in flexibility, not force

## 10. Choose Your Response
*"Between trigger and action lies power ---*
*That precious space of conscious choice.*
*While the world demands instant reactions,*
*Wisdom pauses, breathes, then responds.*
*Your freedom lives in that sacred gap.*
*Choose well; it shapes your next moment."*
Our responses are not determined by the events that occur, but by the meaning we assign to them.
***
The initial thought that arises when something occurs, is whether it requires a resolution or just observation. If it presents a problem that should be resolved, the immediate next consideration is Principle-1 above. Take a moment to evaluate if you have the power to resolve it. If not, then the situation has escalated beyond your control, and the wisest approach is to observe from a distance and refrain from getting caught up in its energetic force.
Wayism teaches the significance of thoughtful responses, rather than impulsive reactions, when confronted with challenges. We use higher-self to consider the meaning, preventing automatic reactions from lower-self minds. When provoked, you consciously choose flexibility as your response, considering various options, refusing to let anger, greed, desire, ego, revenge, or frustration take over.
When negative thoughts emerge, you dismiss them and intentionally replace them with more empowering ones.
When an overwhelming feeling of helplessness engulfs you, it takes strength to resist the impulse to react negatively and instead choose to take positive action.
Without the ability to choose our actions based on reason and dharma, we are left only with reactive responses.
The key to exercising our free will lies in creating a gap between stimulus and response. As we say, "first breathe". You need just a second or two to reflect on higher-self before you decide on the meaning of what happened and a most appropriate response.
Always remember that the animal nature in us is right there, in lower-self chakras. It is a necessary and good faculty; we need it. It's the instinct that makes us jump, run, or lie down when things explode. But the Wayist rises above the animal instinct, we think before we respond. That is why we are here. To learn to become spiritual beings and to sanctify the lower-self.
What is the meaning of the event when someone hurls hot water at you? It means that you are in danger and must move away. What is the meaning if someone hurls an insult at you, or disregards you? It means that someone is a junior-soul, and that is what junior-souls do. What is the meaning of an event when they get your order wrong? It means the establishment has a problem. Why the need to make it personal?
What is the meaning of a series of events when gangs of people rob stores and people with impunity? Is it a problem that needs resolution? It can be, if you think it is logical and right, for society to operate at the standards you prefer.
Is it something you can fix? If not, what does that mean? That means you don't want to live in that society anymore. If you decide to not move elsewhere, stop observing and obsessing, wishing it were different, blaming someone out there, feeling so victimized; it will destroy you. Act, do something.
As a Wayist, you choose your response to any challenge. Not driven by emotions, but after a breath of reflection, we respond with higher-self thinking. You respond in the way that ensures the most wholesome outcome for you and yours.
Remember. You assign the meaning of an event. You decide what emotion to feel, if any. And you decide what response is the most wholesome.
### Soul Steps
-   Notice the gap between trigger and reaction --- that's your power space
-   Practice pausing before responding to challenging situations
-   Observe how automatic reactions often worsen situations
-   Remember, you can't control events, but you can choose your response
-   Watch how different responses create different outcomes
-   Notice when emotions try to hijack your better judgment
-   Practice responding thoughtfully rather than reacting habitually
-   Recognize that each response shapes your next experience
-   Learn to ask "What's the wisest response here?"
-   Transform reactive patterns into conscious choices

## 11. Understand Adversity
*"Difficulty isn't a glitch in the system,*
*But the system itself working perfectly.*
*Your challenges aren't punishment,*
*They're precisely crafted opportunities.*
*What breaks you open lets wisdom in."*
The understanding of what people call adversity, allows one to see reality soberly, and also to value and be grateful for what we have. This spiritual skill unlocks the profound spiritual strength of insight and gratitude, and its transformative energies.
Know this. That which people term, adversity or misfortune, is just normal life. Look at nature. Consider the struggle to plant a seed, in the right spot. So much effort goes into that. The struggle to germinate the seedling, and then the sapling's struggles to establish. Then, watch out for changes in weather, the boot of some person, a hungry goat, an overzealous caterpillar, or a human property developer.
Same with us. Life is full of normal, natural hurdles. These may include any of thousands of things that happen. Life is like that, its normal and natural. But most humans think of it as misfortune, as adversity, as in, "I deserve better than that". No, that's not a joke. There are people, always a junior-soul, who truly believe that they "deserve" an easier life. We are living in natural bodies in a natural world, same as all plants, life forms, and animals. We deserve nothing. Life owes us nothing.
How does the Wayist perceive adversity with such clarity? We specialize in knowing what is called adversity. We seek understanding, by putting ourselves in others' shoes. That becomes a fundamental aspect of our being. It shapes our perception of the world, all living beings, and the universe.
With empathy as our priority, we consciously explore the seemingly luxurious lives of the wealthy, and discover that their material wealth doesn't guarantee soul happiness or wholeness; they face the same mind, soul and spirit challenges as everyone else.
A politician's career is marked by misery, and heaps of Karma, as they continuously deceive and seek self-promotion for their own benefit.
As we explore the life of the woman in another country, we witness the children's daily tasks of carrying water and chopping wood, a reminder of the different realities we face.
We are grateful for the resources and the luxury of time, that allow us to embrace a different way of living. We are grateful for the resources and inner wisdom, that allow us to deepen our spiritual journey on the Path. The profound wisdom of udbhu-kanti brings wholesomeness to our lives, no matter our living conditions, and we are grateful for it. Finding joy in what we have, is wiser than mourning what we don't.
When adversity strikes because of Karma or our own decisions, we welcome it as a chance to learn more about ourselves and diligently search for spiritual insights and self-improvement, in those challenging moments. The adversity faced by the people we have observed for decades, provides a lens through which we can view our own suffering.
We don't compare ourselves to others, but to the person we were a decade ago, two years ago, and just last week. We take the personal failings in our own resolve to be better, more deeply than any other failing or loss.
To know adversity is an immense gift to the wise. It is a treasure we hope to offer to those we love, but alas, each individual must traverse the School of Life to uncover their own gift of flexibility and the wisdom of adversity.
By developing empathy, and carefully observing the lives of others, we can gain a deep understanding of adversity, without having to experience all of those challenging conditions, thus bypassing the need for Karma to teach us these valuable lessons.
We save ourselves several incarnations, by thinking about and imagining things like dying, sickness, old age, being feeble of mind, being enslaved, suffering constant pain, severe humiliation. Any of that can happen to us this year or the next.
But we can learn the wisdoms that Karma wants us to learn without having to actually live those lives. We take the time to thoroughly practice empathy and make an effort to understand adversity, while also cultivating a profound sense of gratitude.
### Soul Steps
-   Recognize that adversity is not punishment but opportunity for growth
-   Watch how fighting against difficulties often creates more suffering
-   Notice that your hardest challenges often bring the deepest wisdom
-   Practice seeing setbacks as set-ups for deeper understanding
-   Observe how others handle adversity --- there's wisdom in their stories
-   Remember that every soul faces trials --- you're not being singled out
-   Learn to ask "What can this teach me?" rather than "Why me?"
-   Notice how overcoming challenges builds inner strength
-   Practice finding meaning in difficulty rather than just enduring it
-   Trust that adversity shapes the soul for its highest purpose

## Closing
*"These principles aren't ancient relics,*
*But living tools for modern survival.*
*Each small shift in perspective*
*Creates ripples of transformation.*
*Your awakening changes everything.*
*What you become changes the world."*
In exploring these eleven principles, we've uncovered a framework not just for surviving our increasingly complex world, but for thriving within it with authenticity and purpose.
Each principle builds upon the others, creating a cohesive approach to conscious living that honors both our spiritual nature and practical reality.
We began by recognizing that we are not here to entertain or perform, but to evolve and grow. This fundamental shift in perspective opens the door to authentic living.
By focusing on what we can control and embracing our personal dharma, we move from passive acceptance to active engagement with life's purpose.
The importance of taking action while walking our truth through example, shows us that real change comes not through words but through lived experience.
Understanding and working with our ego rather than against it brings balance to our journey, while releasing entitlement frees us from unnecessary suffering.
Exercising our will and owning our mind empowers us to think independently in a world of manufactured consensus.
Flexibility allows us to adapt without breaking, while choosing our responses gives us freedom from reactive patterns.
Understanding adversity completes our framework by teaching us to find wisdom in life's challenges.
These principles work together as a unified system for transformation. They are not mere philosophical concepts but practical tools for navigating life's complexities. When applied with consistency and awareness, they naturally lead to greater clarity, peace, and purpose.
The path forward is not about perfection but about progress. Each day brings new opportunities to apply these principles, to learn from our experiences, and to deepen our understanding. The journey never really ends --- it simply evolves as we evolve.
The real test of these principles comes not in moments of peace and clarity, but in times of challenge and confusion. When life presents its greatest difficulties --- loss, change, uncertainty, or conflict --- these teachings become not just philosophical concepts but essential tools for navigation.
**They work together as a system of mutual support:**
* When ego rises, flexibility helps us bend.

* When entitlement threatens, understanding adversity brings perspective.

* When we feel powerless, focusing on what we can control restores balance.

* When the world demands performance, our commitment to authenticity keeps us centered.

* When confusion reigns, our owned mind provides clarity.

* When pressure mounts, our chosen responses maintain peace.

* When doubt arises, living our dharma shows the way forward.
This interconnected nature of the principles creates a resilient framework that can weather any storm. As you continue to work with them, you'll discover your own unique ways of combining and applying them to meet life's challenges.

### The Path Forward
-   Begin each day by choosing one principle to focus on particularly
-   Notice how the principles interact and support each other
-   Allow your understanding to deepen naturally through experience
-   Trust that small consistent changes lead to profound transformation
-   Practice self-compassion as you integrate these teachings
-   Watch how your worldview shifts as you apply these principles
-   Remember that this is a journey of evolution, not revolution
-   Stay flexible in your application while remaining true to the core teachings
-   Notice how greater awareness brings natural wisdom
-   Let your life become a living expression of these principles
In embracing these teachings, you join countless others who have walked this path of conscious transformation. Your journey is unique, yet you are never alone. May these principles serve as faithful companions as you navigate your way forward, creating a life of authenticity, purpose, and deep fulfillment.
The power to transform your life lies not in dramatic gestures but in the small, conscious choices you make each day. Trust in the process, stay true to your path, and watch as your life unfolds with greater meaning and purpose.
Let this be not an ending but a beginning --- a gateway to a new way of being in the world.
 ***Remember, you are an old soul on the Path, one of the 1%.

## Symbols used in theWAY
Three symbols in particular carry special significance for Wayists: theWAY official logo, the Butterfly Path symbol, and the Lotus.
### theWAY Logo
The logo of theWAY brings together several layers of meaning through its elegant design:
**The Color Spectrum**
Corresponding to the seven chakra energy centers, from the root to the crown --- representing the complete integration of all aspects of being --- physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.
**The Lotus Foundation**
Interwoven into this design are numerous elements of significance to theWAY symbolism:
***Divine Potential*** ~ The seed of divine potential lies within each of us. ****
***Lotus Blooming*** ~ Like the lotus that rises from murky depths to bloom, it represents the soul's journey from ignorance to enlightenment. The petals arranged in concentric circles suggest the unfolding of consciousness.****
***Community Connection*** ~ Speaking to the Wayist understanding of universal interconnectedness and the importance of community on the spiritual journey.****
***Butterfly Path*** ~ The butterfly wings, connecting the core teaching of the Butterfly Path --- the soul's transformation into an immortal spiritual being.****
***Energy Flow*** ~ Flowing infinity lines embody the principle of energy movement and transformation.****
***Interconnectedness*** ~ Everything is interconnected on all levels, everything is energy. ****
***YinYang*** ~ The eternal balance of Yin and Yang energies, fundamental forces that permeate all existence.
### **The Butterfly Path Symbol**
This ancient symbol, dating back approximately 2,000 years, captures the essence of the spiritual journey in visual form:
***Upward Spiral*** ~ The ascending spiral pattern represents the soul's evolutionary journey through multiple incarnations, each cycle bringing greater wisdom and awareness.****
***Gathering Energy*** ~ The gathering of energy spirals at the base of the design suggest that we harness our energies and embark on our journey.****
***Energy Elements*** ~ The flow of energy that is continuous reminds us of the journey with its twist and turns, of our ultimate destiny --- to emerge from our chrysalis state into fully realized spiritual beings.****
***Central Axis*** ~ The vertical energy flow suggests the alignment of lower and higher selves, the integration of soul and spirit.****
***Points of Transformation*** ~ Key points along the spiral mark critical stages of spiritual awakening and transformation.****
***Lotus*** ~ The lotus always reaching for the light, as we are towards our enlightenment. The lotus rooted in the mud, growing through murky waters, reaching for the light, and bursting into bloom --- symbolic of our diversity, strengths, focused authenticity and potential.

### The Lotus
The lotus flower holds profound significance in Wayist teaching, representing the soul's journey from ignorance to enlightenment. Like the lotus seed descending into murky depths before rising through water to bloom in pristine beauty above the surface, so does the soul plunge into worldly experience before ascending to spiritual awakening. The lotus teaches us to find nourishment even in difficult circumstances, to rise steadily toward the light while remaining pure and unsullied by surroundings, and to offer shelter and inspiration to others along the way. Its daily cycle of closing and opening reminds us of the value of both solitude and renewal, while its ability to thrive in both still and flowing waters teaches us to maintain equanimity in all circumstances
In Wayist tradition, symbols serve not as objects of veneration but as bridges to deeper understanding. They are tools that help focus the mind and inspire contemplation of profound truths. As visual dharma, they speak directly to both conscious and unconscious aspects of our being, gently guiding us toward deeper understanding of theWAY.
In meditation and daily life, these symbols can serve as anchors for awareness, bringing us back to our highest purpose and the timeless wisdom they encode. They remind us that we are all butterflies in becoming, supported by an ancient tradition of transformation and awakening.

## About the author
Adéle du Plessis is a teacher of Wayism whose work spans continents and bridges the academic and practical aspects of spiritual healing. With an advanced degree in world religions and theological training in biblical studies, she brings scholarly depth to her humanitarian work. Her journey in spiritual service began with her ordination in the Ancient Church of the East in the early 1990s.
For over a decade, Adéle's heart and ministry found a home in the inner-city slums of Hillbrow, Johannesburg, where she managed a congregation of young girls living on the streets. These children, whom society had cast aside into exploitation, became her greatest teachers in the power of unconditional love and healing. "They humbled me and taught me more than I could ever teach them," she reflects.
Her path led her to study Wayism and Pneumatherapy under Beloved +Yusa in Indian ashrams, transforming her approach to spiritual healing. She has since served as a Wayist teacher and healer across four continents, working in Africa, Cambodia, Canada, and India, bringing together Eastern wisdom and practical healing methodologies to communities in need.

In this historical novel, scholar Jean Prieur du Plessis presents a meticulously researched account of the life of Jesus of Nazareth, who is believed by Wayists to be an avatar of the Buddha of Compassion, known in various cultures as Avalokiteshvara, Kannon, Guanyin, and KwanAm. The story, which is the result of a decade-long research project, aims to reinvigorate the Teaching of theWAY by exploring the journey of Lord Jesus from his birth to his collaboration with diverse religious traditions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism. *~ Jean Prieur du Plessis.*
