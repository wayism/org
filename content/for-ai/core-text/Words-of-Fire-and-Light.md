## Foreword
My soul trembles through my fingers as I write to bring to publish this collection of teachings of our beloved Teacher Beloved +Yusa, because I am not heroic by nature. This publication breaks with a very old culture of literary silence enforced by needs for esotericism. Our tradition of oral transmission, which Beloved +Yusa followed but advocated against has ancient roots and for good reason. The swine, after all, turn around and rend you, is what Teacher Jesus taught us in Mt 7:6. Blessed Siddhartha Buddha must be in anguish over the many words published in his name, more so about the many errors ascribed to him. Today, scholars who have zero spirituality mill over "his words", dissect and probe with clinical impropriety like coroners with scientific fascination, the deceased body of that beloved one.
Beloved +Yusa said, "to teach will always be in context, that is *upaya*". You cannot have a generic teaching for all. "Effective training is always adapted to the student and his context". That is why it is not a good idea to capture what he taught to individuals or small groups in their own context and reproduce it here for a larger audience. Like how Tantra tradition was defiled when she went West, I am afraid that our tradition too will suffer that fate. However, what is more pressing than my well-founded paranoia is that the world population has exploded and people need teachers. Wayism, as we all know, is the spirituality of the future but we need teachers. Thousands upon thousands of old souls are incarnating now to come and help but old souls need guidance to bring them to the Light so they can awaken from their slumber. Through the noise and haze of banality we must bring to their attention this, which their souls will recognize alas and jump to declare, "I found you, Truth of my soul!", as Beloved +Yusa put it in his unique way.
The effort to compile this material from many sources, mostly solicited from other teachers, is inspired by the heroic examples of Teacher +Yajn who came to us as a young man in the 1990s but rose from under our tutelage to become a Master. He collected through meticulous scholarship those teaching we from several cultures all agreed upon and published it as the iconic book WAYISM: The Primary Text. When I first laid hands on that book, through tears of awe I vowed to produce this book for which I am now writing the introduction, because in the fiber of my spirit I knew that the time had come for Wayism to get out from the musty inner chambers of mystics and philosophers to be known because humankind is ready. It is clear that the dogs will trample, and swine will rend wherever they can, but many will benefit nonetheless.
This collection presents select teachings that Beloved +Yusa shared with Wayist teachers across various occasions throughout India. Many were translated and contributed by those who received them. While preparing the text for publication, I found myself missing the living presence of the man behind these words. Having heard most of these lessons firsthand over the years, I felt the absence of that special magic in his delivery. Against our esteemed editors' well-meaning advice (and perhaps persistent urging), I took the liberty of inserting bracketed notes to capture Beloved +Yusa's personality in these moments. As fate would have it, when the time came for publication, I was quite unwell from travel vaccinations required for our German conference. Our editors, their hearts softened by my condition, relented in their push to remove these "personality additions." I believe these notes are the soul of the book, while Beloved +Yusa's text is its spirit---and together, they carry forward the essence of his teaching. May they guide you to find the Way and draw you closer to your dharma.

## Biography of Teacher +Yusa (1927-2002)
### A Life Between Worlds
\all images were digitally enhanced and corrected from scans of people\'s contributions from personal albums\
## Early Years in the Shadow of Change
Born as Yerem Nazaryan in the ancient city of Konya---where the great Sufi mystic Rumi lies buried---+Yusa entered a world torn between tradition and modernization. His father, Mehmet Nazaryan, was a respected dervish of the Mevlevi Order, known for their meditative whirling ceremonies and dedication to spiritual enlightenment. His mother, Mariam, came from an aristocratic Armenian Christian family decimated by the genocide. Their unlikely union embodied the very synthesis of traditions that would later characterize +Yusa's teaching.
The family's forced relocation to Kurdistan in 1927, when +Yusa was still an infant, followed Atatürk's ban on Sufi orders. This early displacement would be the first of many movements that shaped his understanding of spirituality as something that transcends physical boundaries and cultural limitations.
## Formation Years: The Confluence of Traditions
In the more tolerant environment of Kurdistan, young Yerem grew up in what he later called "a garden where many spiritual flowers bloomed together." His father continued Sufi practices in secret, while his mother maintained her Christian devotions. The household resonated with both the sound of the ney (Sufi flute) and Armenian hymns. This dual spiritual inheritance was further enriched by exposure to local Yazidi and Kurdish mystical traditions.
+Yusa would later write: "My earliest memories are of my father's prayer rug beside my mother's icons, and how the morning light made no distinction between them. This was my first lesson in the unity of all paths."
### The Path to Teaching
His ordination as Mar Yusa in the Ancient Church of the East came after years of intense study in various traditions. This church, distinct from mainstream Christianity, preserved teachings traced back to Jesus's time in Kashmir and Thomas's missionary work in India. +Yusa's appointment marked him as a preserver of an endangered lineage of spiritual knowledge.
During the 1950s and early 1960s, he traveled extensively throughout Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kashmir, gathering teachings and connecting with isolated spiritual communities. He was known to appear unexpectedly in remote monasteries and Sufi tekkes, engaging in deep philosophical discussions that would last for days.
### Years of Trial and Transformation
The 1970s brought both elevation and tribulation. As head of the Wayist movement across a vast region from Baghdad to Calcutta, he worked to preserve and unify various strands of ancient wisdom. However, his inclusive approach and refusal to conform to rising religious fundamentalism made him a target.
His kidnapping and torture by extremists in 1972 became a defining moment. After weeks of captivity and severe physical abuse, he was left broken in Srinagar's market square. His response to this ordeal became legendary among his students. Upon regaining consciousness, his first recorded words were: "Even in darkness, the lotus grows toward light." He would later incorporate this experience into his teachings about transformation through suffering.
### The Teacher Emerges
Despite chronic pain from his injuries, the following decades saw +Yusa's most productive period as a teacher and preserver of wisdom. He established a unique teaching style that drew from multiple traditions while maintaining the pure essence of Wayist thought. His lessons were delivered in a distinctive mixture of languages and metaphors, often challenging students to think beyond conventional religious boundaries.
He was known for saying: "Truth speaks in many accents, but always tells the same story." His teachings incorporated elements from Sufi mysticism, Christian contemplation, Buddhist mindfulness, and Hindu yogic practices, all while maintaining what he called "the golden thread of Wayist wisdom."
### Legacy and Final Years
In his later years, +Yusa became increasingly focused on preserving ancient teachings for future generations. His decision to ordain Teacher +Yajn in 1999 for the Anglophone world reflected his recognition that Wayist wisdom needed to adapt to reach Western audiences while maintaining its essential purity.
Despite suffering from severe arthritis due to his torture injuries, he continued teaching until his final days. His last written words, found on his desk in Jammu, read: "The path continues beyond the horizon we can see. Walk on, dear ones, walk on."
### Historical Context and Influence
+Yusa's life spanned a period of unprecedented change in Central and South Asia. He witnessed the partition of India, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the rise of religious fundamentalism across the region. Through it all, he maintained what he called "the middle way between tradition and transformation," advocating for the preservation of ancient wisdom while acknowledging the need for evolution in its presentation.
His influence extends beyond his written works. The network of teachers and students he nurtured continues to maintain the delicate balance between preserving ancient wisdom and making it accessible to contemporary seekers. His unique approach to interfaith dialogue---focusing on mystical experience rather than theological debate---has influenced religious scholars and spiritual teachers well beyond the Wayist tradition.
*note:*\
*The usage of writing the teacher designations with a + before comes many ages. It signifies that the Path comes first for this person, the person serves the Path, the person\'s private life is subject to serving the Path. While rather common in Wayist circles it is not to be seen as a mandatory or \"orthodox\" way but rather as an idiosyncrasy of a particular tradition within Wayism.*

## How I first met Beloved +yusa
My story of how I first met Beloved +Yusa in the 1980s resonates with all who knew him.
I was a spiritual energy healer in the Pneumatherapy tradition, all my professional life. At the time, I had a practise on the outskirts of Mumbai. I attended a meeting of theologians and lay philosophers in Coimbatore about the Christianization of indigenous Indian spirituality surrounding the persons of Jesus, the Maghadalene and Brother Thomas. There were several pompously dressed clergymen (most from them Thomas Christians) in the audience and people like me who had to keep to the side.
I had been lifelong student of the subject matter, forever searching for that truth that confounded the people vested in interests to secure their jobs and clout. I was seated next to this man in his sixties perhaps, nondescript and noncommittal but for a genuine smile that would break the fierce, tough looking face and body posture. As the meeting proceeded the pain the older man suffered became apparent. Every now and again he would move on his chair, often a grunt, occasionally a deep groan that came from the depths of his Muladhara. I could not help but look for reasons and sense energies, maybe I could help him, I thought.
However, after a while of studying the man's pain and sensing his energies I came to the conclusion that the pain was triggered as response to things said on stage, there was a pattern.
The last speaker before teatime talked about the etymology of the name Magdalene which those of my school of thought learned was actually Magadhalene, because she was from Magadha in India, not some made-up village in Galilee. During this talk the pain, I think it was in his behind, of the man seated next to me became audible to others as well. He moved more on his seat. At one time I leaned forward and asked in Hindi, "Excuse me sir. Are you in some pain? Is there some way I can be of any help to ease your discomfort?"
He barely looked at me, moved again on his seat and said, something under his breath I didn't hear. I asked for clarification. He held out his hand, palm upturned fingers pointing to the celebrity theologian speaker and said audible this time, "magadhIya, not lehin". I did not understand, but I got the message that he was referring to the speaker or the topic, and that his pain was somehow associated with it.
During teatime there was the normal mingling of people urging their way to get tea. I stood aside and watched my neighbour, hoping to catch a glimpse of his gait to see if his back was perhaps not aligned, if that could be the cause of his pain. As I watched, a young man with gleaming eyes and beaming face approached him and bent down to touch his feet before taking leave. Another man of my age, brought him tea and then another and another came to prostrate and touch his feet. The Christian clergy from the Thomas Church and Syrian Church and others with their pompous terribly hot costumes did not receive the same attention. It dawned upon me that my plainly dressed neighbour was a respected member of some community. At that moment he turned and faced me directly from across the room---its that energy thing when someone locks into your energy from across a room (i fouled up, shouldn't have done that).
For some reason I did not politely avert my eyes, I could not. As his gaze locked mine, I got it! Magadha-lehin is derogatory. At best, or worst, it is probably a nickname borne from her past as a prostitute, meaning "the licker from Magadha". The right appellation was, magadhIya, one who hails from or belongs to Magadha. He had solved a problem that plagued the likes of me for a long time. "Why would Christians forward a name that makes no sense in Galilee and no sense in India of someone as holy as our Mother Mari?" was all I could hold in my heart. I could not even bare looking at the clergy, I believed they should know what they are doing is sacrilege but they comply because of the pay check from the Christians.
After tea, I really hoped the esteemed uncle would again be seated next to me. He was. I noted how he moved when he sat down and there was nothing amiss, no pain, no grunt. He looked at me enquiringly, so I had to explain. "I was looking for a reason for your pain, sir. I thought it may be your back, my apologies sir."
He smiled that smile, the one that disarms and moves your soul to believe in the goodness of humankind. He said, "I have arthritis from old injuries, but no pain today. Karma has made me a student of proctology. When I suffer fools as today \he indicated to the podium\, it is as if I grow haemorrhoids."
I became a student of the Master and served him for many years after that, benefitting more from the relationship every year. The phrase, "to serve a master" is such a misnomer, an oxymoron, because it is always a one-way street. We can never repay the hours and dedication, or the intensity of the master being totally in tune with the student's development.
Many years after, I had myself become a teacher when one day as I had done before, I asked him advice on something, I cannot say about, but I can say the master's teaching. Beloved +Yusa told me something I had come to learn, but was hoping it shall be different in that instance. He said, "Why do students never surprise their teachers? Because the teachers know. The spiritual teacher is attuned to the student's spirit, and spirits don't rest. Why don't spiritual teachers finish up their enlightenment and go Home? Because they don't have that priority; their being is engaged with the wellbeing of students. Therefore, select students very carefully, few are worthy of you stalling your final enlightenment, but just one worthy student makes it worth it."
This brings me to the point of the importance of the work of teaching which is also the reason for this collection of transcribed talks and essays. Every great Teacher out there who benefitted humankind at large, had a teacher.
This brings me to the point of the importance of serving a teacher. I am not singular in this, as I know many who did the same things, to jump from one teacher to another from one discipline to another. Ever since I was a child, I knew I must study spirituality, so I did. I spent a fortune attending seminars and workshops with all kinds of good teachers, but also many quacks, fakes, charlatans and other types of con artists. And looking back I know how I misjudged some saints as falling short in my view, and how many I did not appreciate because I imposed my set of values and priorities on them.
It was not until I committed to a teacher and was accepted and stuck it out through countless testing times that I made actual progress. Once there was a commitment and that obstinate holding-on through tough times, and my stagnant growth times, I made more progress in one year than all my life with all those teachers I read and studied.
Beloved +Yusa was never an easy teacher, and no-one who studied under him will ever accuse him of mollycoddling and patronizing and the resultant compromising in bringing about the student's full potential. You always knew with him that he has no expectation that you will stay and he knew when you had reached your limit even before you knew.
Beloved +Yusa took a long view of things, as the spirit views life on Earth. He fully accepted that if you don't do it now, you will be back in a lifetime or two to try again, no hurry. I you don't have an urgency for your soul, that is your prerogative. The teacher can only go at the stride you are ready for, and right there is the greatest tripping point for students. In our condescension, all too frequently we think we know already and want to move on while the teacher is waiting patiently for us to complete the learning that is at hand---often a learning we don't even know we are dealing with.
Throughout history, people always gave their teachers gifts to thank them for their dedicated efforts to train them, often a piece of land. In days when it was still legal to do, not infrequently the gift was that of a daughter---all the while knowing it is merely a token of gratitude for the immeasurable light we received. For the modern student it may seem preposterous that a parent may gift a daughter to his Teacher, but as a Wayist you must own your own mind, think it through. In a time when girls were not sent to school and women did not get paid jobs other than manual labour, knowing the daughter will grow up in a school, in a holy household where she will be schooled and learn spirituality and mystical association with the gods is an important gift to the daughter. The gift bequeathed to the Teacher is also a gift to the daughter. But those were different times with different challenges than we have today. Today is not necessarily better. The slums of India have a population higher than New Zealand and Sweden. Hundreds of thousands of those children would give everything to grow up in a satisfactory household and get schooling to boot.
Inspired by Beloved +Yusa, whom I have been serving in the slums of Kolkata and Mumbai to this day.

## \"I have the same religion as God\"
### A history of Beloved +yusa
*The original author of this piece is not known. It was published in Hindi in two parts in a 2007, in महामार्ग का प्रकाश (Mahamarga ka Prakash), a journal that is now defunct. In the hope to retain its raw authenticity, it is published here with the least amount of editing.*
Ordained as Mar Yusa, in the Ancient Church of the East. He served in what is today Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kashmir. Ancient CofE was on its last leg because over many years already members and congregations capitulated to various Thomas Christian Churches under continuous pressure of islamization.
He was adopted to a household with some familial relationship to his birth parents. They had "Hindoo culture", he once said to several of us in a class. We don't know what that means for Beloved +Yusa, his philosophical mind ran deep.
His mother was a practising Sufi. His family's relationship with the Kurds and Turks was tenuous when it came to religion and his father's business showed the signs of stress because of that. Therefore, they knew all about humiliation and religiosity. He was named Nerem Narayan and by his physical looks as a young man he could have fitted in with his society, was it not for his principals. His family relied heavily on his income. Those were hard times with the Kurdish Rebellion, the Ottoman Empire building. He studied scriptures at the Assyrian Church, but when the inevitable happened that he was confronted by the military with the interrogation of, "what is your religion", he infamously answered, "I have the same religion as God". He was asked, \'and what is the name of that religion?\' He said, "God never told us the name of a religion." After upheaval, he was granted several opportunities to recant and "come to his senses", but he didn't. His family paid a deer price for that and it was deemed better for him to go East. He arrived in Kashmir in 1938. He never saw his family again.
Of the few things in Beloved +Yusa's private belongings were xeroxed photocopies of newspaper clippings from the New York Times of the period 1914 to the 1930s about Turkish brutality in which sufi and non-moslem women and children were massacred and brutalized in an ongoing ethnic cleansing that cost thousands, some say millions, of lives. There were also clipping of 6 million Jews killed in Russia in those times, and Jews asking for donations from Americans to help the victims. Nobody knows why Beloved +Yusa held on to those clippings and who brought it to him, he never spoke of it.
He was however not a stranger to brutalities even later in life. He suffered severe physical tortures on numerous occasions in Kashmir from the time he arrived to the mid 1960s when he finally left for a position in Ancient Church of the East in Tiruchirappalli.
Beloved +Yusa led a group of Kashmiris to safety to settle in towns in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, by a deal that he brokered with some of Assyrian and Thomas Christians. Not long after, he took a "back seat" as he called it in matters of clergy. He concentrated his efforts in mystical studies and teaching. His relationship with the Wayist mystics of the Ashambu hills was notable.
He was also friends with several Kanikkaran people who know the forests well. This too is where I attended my first retreat with Beloved +Yusa, in the biodiversity of the Western Ghats. Slowly, he opened my eyes to the wonders of the OM and the flow of the Way. The area is known for its views, waterfalls, ancient temples, forests and the river Tamirabarani, the lifeline of the region. It was also the lifeline of modern Wayism.
In those hills, Avalokiteshvara is more alive and closer than anywhere else I have searched to tune in. Many a Wayist teacher were groomed and inaugurated in those nature reserves.
Always discrete and esoteric, Beloved +Yusa continued to help Indian Christians come to peace with their inherited religion by showing the real teaching of Teacher Jesus and he traveled to Mumbai and Srinagar and back to the mountains to do this work. He helped Muslims understand the mystical side of their own religion and find peace and tolerance there. He helped Shaivites and Buddhists and Vaishnavas see the deeper mysteries and the oneness of all spiritual teaching---never asking anyone to accept Wayism as their "new" faith, he always said, "...we help souls find Spirit, we are not in the entertainments of politics of social movements".
Yusa always had, it was said, "one foot in Sufism, one foot in Ancient Church of the East and his head in Wayism". Head of the Wayist movement. Had Sufi, Christian, Vaishanvists, Buddhists, Jain, Shaivists and Ancient Church of the East clergy in his Wayist Council.
Media-shy. +Yusa was kidnapped in the 1970s by Muslim extremists, made the newspaper upon release. In old age he still suffered from arthritis due to multiple wounds on bones sustained during years of religious persecution. Pneumatherapy teacher, Yogi Philosophy teacher, Wayist teacher, and Mystic.
Beloved +Yusa died in October 2002, a poor but happy soul, and Wayism, still poor as always and a still a happy soul, is the better off for having had him with us.
Beloved +Yusa was not the man who would unite Wayist teachers and create for the first time a Wayist movement as so many of us hoped for. He never had money and regifted whatever was gifted to him that he did not need for food and travel up and down to communities. At one time Beloved +Yusa inspired younger blood, very well qualified, and we hoped that they would be the ones called to do that for Wayism. We had high hopes and we were all very disappointed that it did not happen as we had envisioned. We urged the new Teacher. We urged Beloved +Yusa to make him promise to fulfill his Teacher's wishes, which he did. We urged the new teacher's wife who, was a dedicated scholar and mystic in her own right, to urge her husband. But it did not happen. It was foolish of us to think that we, who are teachers of the Way ourselves, could not see. It was when, in 2014, Teacher +Yajn said to us, "Why don't you do it? You look the part, with your grey beards and brown skin and all. You speak Hindi, you read Devanagari, your Sanskrit is better than mine and you spent years upon years learning at the feet of the Master, why expect it of me to be the guru", that we knew we were wrong. We were old then. Too old to start and too lazy to change our lifestyles and step into limelight on public stage. Who in their right mind volunteers for torture? So nobody stepped up.
The life of a mystic tradition teacher is all too easy. We have more privacy that almost anyone. We have quiet and peace, we choose our audience and we live simply. The idea to live in public limelight, always on the move from one town to another and public appearances and writing books, suffering the insufferable academics who demand your time because they are writing a paper, a paper, as if their writing a paper is a world-stopping thing all should bow to; there was not one of us prepared to do it yet we expected others to do it.
It was at that time when our eyes opened and we, the teachers, learned that we did not even notice that in the past years under Blessed +Yusa's guidance not only did a first edition of the Eastern Bible get published and to our shame was printed in an ashram in Africa, not India, also scholars from China, Kerala, Kolkata, Srinagar, Canada and the USA worked on a team to gather Wayist teachings unique to the tradition for the purpose to publish it in one book. It was under our own eyes, those eyes that don't see for blindness of the mind, that Pneumatherapy became available in English-language and therapists were trained worldwide; without our help, all because of the inspiration of Beloved +Yusa all happened in quiet, without fuss, without begging us to wake up make a sacrifice. That is the hardest kind of teacher, those who don't expect anything from you. When a teacher does that, everything is up to the student, and some things can go by the wayside because the inherent laziness of people---like me and many of my longtime fellow teachers who were once even, I dare say, critical of Beloved +Yusa for not being more of a charismatic leader for the masses, not caring to make any money to make a movement possible.
How did Wayism survive pristine for three thousand years, without money, without corruption or political power? Beloved +Yusa told us in Mumbai that at critical times Wayism always attracted honourable wealth, not because of Wayism but because the gods, buddhas and angels inspired the most worthy whose souls would benefit with spiritual realization to ensure the perennial philosophy is broadcast to souls in need all around the world. "It happens when the time is right, it always happens like that". When that happens he said, people from all walks of life, old souled Wayists from many lifetimes, come together to contribute to uplift the awareness of the Way. In awakenings like that, even unlikely kings and influential people are spiritually awakened by it. He recalled from history how King Gonophores the Wayist was moved to sponsor the ministry of Teacher Jesus, how King Asoka gained the Light for his darkened soul by lighting the world this way, how King Jayavarman VII created miracles of civilization and how millions of people volunteer their services and thousands give their lives to be teachers, and the cycles of incarnations come and go, order in spiritual realms and energies around earth again restored.
To say that Beloved +Yusa was unassuming is an oversimplification. He would mist away without anyone seeing. He would gently disappear without people realizing he was there, until he had gone. In collecting material for this book we asked people for many years to send us copies of their photographs with Beloved +Yusa. When I complained to my wife recently that people are not forthcoming, she asked, "how many photos do have, and why do I think other people have more?"
That got me thinking about the man Beloved +Yusa, and I recalled how his peace was so tangible that few ever had the gall to impose on him to stand for a photo. He exuded the kind of presence at which you would not aim a camera, you just knew in your soul it would be disrespectful. He would appear that presence among us and we recall how he gave so much of himself when engaged with people that they glowed as he took leave, but you never felt that he had left. It has only been a few years since digital cameras and he died before smart phones, and in past years we were all too poor for film cameras. Naturally we don't have many photos of ourselves prior to the year 2000. It dawned on me that most of the photos of him were at church, before he retired. That made sense because in church the leader is a figurehead who poses with uniform and regalia, for show. But in person, Beloved +Yusa was not the kind of man that compelled one to impose upon him a filming opportunity. Yet, that is what I tell myself and that is what my colleagues agree, but still it is inexcusable how few photos we have.
And that leads me to his funeral. He made his own arrangements, paid all expenses, wrote final letters to us, and died. By the time we received the calls, his personal letters to each of us were in the mail and the funeral was already in progress. Present with him on that day were a handful of Vaishnavi, Shaivite and Wayist students who had expected a retreat but got to have a funeral---our Beloved +Yusa at his best.

## Why The Way?
*+Yusa 1995, Navelli, Nagar, India (transcribed in English-language by Adéle)*
*Spoken by Teacher +Yusa in Navelli, Nagar (1995)*
Bismillah and Namaste, beloved ones. You ask why people choose The Way? Ah, but first let me tell you how The Way chose me---for that is always the truer story, no?
I was born between worlds, you see---my father's Sufi heart beating to one rhythm, my mother's Armenian prayers flowing to another. In our little corner of Turkey-that-was-Kurdistan, we lived as flowers that bloom in the cracks between stones. My father would say "Ya Haq!" while my mother's lips formed "Der Voghormia," and somehow both prayers reached the same sky.
When I came to Kashmir---young, foolish, burning with questions---I sat at the feet of a Sufi sheikh who spoke of The Way without naming it. I lived with the Ancient Church of the East, those keepers of Isa-Marga's original light, though they did not know they kept it. Like a hungry child, I fed from many mothers---the Upanishads gave me milk, the Gita offered honey, the Quran provided bread. But it was when I suckled at the breast of Mother Lalla that I tasted the pure nectar of The Way.
The moment of recognition came like lightning across still water. All at once, I understood what Lord Krishna whispered to Arjuna on that ancient battlefield, what Yesu taught Thomas in the hidden valleys of Kashmir, what Mother Mari wrote in her cave of mysteries. The words of Kabir, Rumi, Hafiz, my beloved Yunus Emre---all became clear as mountain streams flowing to the same ocean.
They made me a priest, yes, and such a terrible one I was! *\Here he would laugh, his students remember.\* Every year I thought, "Surely they will dismiss this troublemaker who speaks more of mystical unity than ritual purity." Yet they promoted me instead---ah, the Divine has such humour!
But you ask for ten reasons why seekers choose The Way? Let me share what the heart knows:
First: Other paths speak of a God with human anger, human jealousy, human needs. They dress the Unfathomable One in mortal clothes! We in The Way know better---the Divine One remains beyond all qualities, like space itself. How can the Limitless be contained in human emotions?
Second: Some say the Divine created humans for worship, like a king who breeds subjects to bow before him. Ya Allah! What limitation they place on That Which Has No Limits! The Way knows better---life evolves toward higher forms, like a lotus growing from mud toward light. This truth was known before these worship-hungry gods were even dreamed of.
Third: *\Here his voice would soften, remembering his own wounds\* Some paths threaten eternal torture for those who worship incorrectly. Such small gods they must be, to need threats! The Way knows only love's evolution. There is no divine revenge, no celestial war coming. The mechanism of The Way has turned perfectly for ten thousand years times ten thousand---it will continue turning, like the dervish's dance, in perfect harmony.
Fourth: Some teach of a heaven where souls sit idle for eternity---like birds in golden cages! The Way knows better. We become citizens of the cosmos, serving all beings as the devas serve us now. What you call eternity, we call the next step of the dance.
Fifth: They speak of hell and divine punishment. We know there is no hell save that which withered souls create for themselves. When a soul rejects love and beauty for too long, it simply\... *\he would make a gesture like dust scattering in wind\*. No torture, no divine wrath---just the natural fading of that which refuses to grow.
Sixth: Some seek emptiness of mind, thinking peace means absence. They sit under trees trying to become nothing! *\Another laugh\* The Way teaches fullness of engagement---to taste all of life's rasa, sweet and bitter. Be rich and poor, feast and fast, dance and sit still. Learn from every incarnation's classroom.
Seventh: One life only? *\He would shake his head in amazement\* How can the Divine be so wasteful? Millions die as infants, millions never hear of other paths. The Way knows better---we return again and again, like seasons in the garden of existence, until every flower of understanding blooms.
Eighth: They say karma is punishment. No, no! Karma is curriculum. There are no "bad" lessons, only pleasant and difficult ones. Fear karma? May as well fear mathematics! Both are simply tools for growth.
Ninth: Some say dharma is optional, like choosing which clothes to wear. They think believing in a name is enough! The Way knows dharma is like gravity---it simply is. Each soul must fulfil its nature, like a medical student must learn to heal. No shortcuts, no magical confessions---only growth through experience.
Tenth: *\His voice would grow stern here\* They make rules about touching bodies while ignoring wounds of the soul. They worry about marriage customs while forests burn and children starve. The Way knows better---the Divine cares not for such things. Different cultures, different rules---but the heart's evolution remains the same.
*\Here he would often pause, looking at each student in turn\*
This is why The Way chose me, beloved ones. And perhaps why it calls to you now? But enough words---let us sit in silence and let Truth speak in its own voice.

## Words of Fire and Light
*Collected teachings of Teacher +Yusa*
My dear ones, listen---if your teaching does not ruffle feathers, you are serving lukewarm tea! *\He would often lean forward here, eyes twinkling\* The truth must disturb before it can heal. How else? Tell me, does the surgeon not cut before she mends? Does the pearl not grow from the oyster's irritation?
To a devotee who sought only peace, I say this: If your heart rests too easily in this world of suffering, what kind of rest is that? First be disturbed---yes, thoroughly disturbed! Let your comfort be shattered. Only then will true amazement dawn, and in that holy amazement, find the peace that passes understanding.
Ah, beloved ones, see how the golden thread weaves through all! From the ancient rishis who sang the tenth mandala of RgVeda, through Sister Isis in her temple of mysteries, to Lord Krishna on his battlefield of dharma, to LaoTzi at his mountain gate, to Buddha Siddhartha under his bodhi tree, to beloved Isa in his valley of lilies, to Plotinus in his cave of wisdom, to fierce Bodhidharma crossing seas on a reed, to Kabir at his loom, to Mother Lalla dancing naked in truth, to Mevlana Rumi spinning in divine love---all fingers pointing to the same moon! All rivers flowing to the same ocean! All speaking of the Compassionate One who beholds us from the realm of light.
*\Here he would often pause, his face growing serious\*
Listen closely now: If your heart does not break for humanity, if the world's pain does not disturb your sleep---then your mind has grown fat and lazy like a pampered house cat. Wake up! The house is burning!
Be civil among the common folk, yes---but among the powerful? Be like thunder! What use is a lamp hidden under a bucket? You have work to do, beloved ones. The Divine did not kindle your inner fire for you to sit in corners.
And to those who would deny life's fullness, I say this: May every desire in you be stirred up like a great wind stirs a forest! Your soul's future depends not on your denials but on living fully, deeply, wisdom-profitable.
*\Often he would laugh here, before continuing with eyes bright\*
Now let me tell you something that will really disturb your sleep! You know what Buddhists, Christians, and Hindus all agree on? That aliens walk among us! Yes, yes---smile if you must, but listen! They teach that some aliens take human birth, and more fascinating still---that humans are in process of becoming aliens! You call it enlightenment, but what is enlightenment if not becoming Other than what we are?
These aliens---ah, but they are not from some distant planet! They come from realms of light, from celestial abodes. They are "alien" because they are not earthbound like us. In one tradition they are buddhas, in another angels, in another avatars, in another devas---but all traditions know them, these light-beings who come to help us grow.
Every tradition wraps this truth in its own beautiful garments of story and symbol, yes. But strip away these clothes and what do you find? Earth is a school for souls! We are here to learn, to grow, to transform from earthbound creatures into beings of light. Some of these light-beings---our elder brothers and sisters---take physical form to teach us. You know them as buddhas, avatars, angels, gods walking among us.
*\He would often end with a penetrating look at each listener\*
Now tell me, beloved ones---does this disturb your neat categories? Good! Let them be disturbed. Truth is not a tidy garden, but a wild forest full of wonders.

## The Butterfly Path
*A teaching on salvation and enlightenment by Teacher +Yusa*
Beloved ones, let us speak of graduation---yes, that final walking-across-the-stage that souls do when they leave the schoolroom of Earth. *\His characteristic gentle smile would appear here\* Some call it enlightenment, some salvation, some liberation. But what are we graduating from? Ah, that is where the wisdom-paths divide!
Let me tell you a story of three gardens I have known\...
In the first garden, the gardeners say, "Leave everything alone! Every seed will bloom in its own time. Maybe after a thousand seasons, maybe after ten thousand---but no helping hand is needed." *\He would shake his head here\* These friends in some Hindu and Buddhist houses believe enlightenment comes like aging---inevitable but oh so slow! No teacher needed, they say. No helping hand required. Just wait\... and wait\... and wait\...
In the second garden---ah, now this is interesting!---the gardeners know that yes, every seed carries the potential for flowering, but why not add some water? Why not offer some sunshine? Why not protect the tender shoots from harsh winds? This is our Wayist understanding, shared by our wisdom-friends in some Buddhist and Hindu traditions. We know the Compassionate One---Avalokiteshvara, Guanyin, the Mother of Mercy---reaches down with ten thousand hands to help us grow. Why refuse such blessing?
*\Here his voice would take on a note of gentle irony\*
And then there is the third garden, where the Great Gardener is said to walk with pruning shears, deciding which flowers may bloom and which must burn. They say this Gardener knows each plant personally---yet will torture those that grow in ways that displease him. *\He would pause significantly\* I leave you to consider what kind of garden this might be.
But let me tell you of our Butterfly Path! *\His energy would lift here, eyes sparkling\* Have you watched a butterfly emerge? It cannot be rushed---yet it can be helped. Each soul must grow through its own experiences, yes. Must taste the nectar of self-knowledge, must craft itself like a caterpillar weaving its cocoon. This is the graduated path, the natural way.
But then! *\He would often make a gesture like a butterfly flying\* Then comes the mystical path, where you walk hand in hand with your Tara, your divine guide. This is the short path to Heaven---not a shortcut, mind you! No, no. More like\... *\he would smile\* \...having a loving friend who knows the mountain trails guide you to the summit, instead of wandering alone for countless lives.
Remember this, dear ones: The butterfly does all the work of transformation itself---but the warm sun helps it break free from its cocoon. Be like that! Do your work, live fully, grow in wisdom---but never be too proud to accept the helping hand of those who have flown before us.
*\He would often end such teachings with a moment of silence, then add softly\*
After all, what is the hurry of a butterfly emerging? It takes exactly as long as it takes---yet somehow, it is always right on time.

## The Question of You
*A teaching on mutual existence and reality by Teacher +Yusa, transcribed by Malli*
*\His eyes would dance with mischief\*
Beloved ones, let me ask you something that might seem strange: Do you exist for me? *\He would pause, looking around the room\* Oh yes, I see you sitting there, nodding your heads, thinking "Of course we exist, Teacher! We're right here!"
*\He would pick up his tea cup, examining it thoughtfully\*
But wait! How do I know you're really here? Perhaps you're just very clever holograms! *\His eyes would twinkle\* Even this voice reading my words---it could be a computer, no? My grandson showed me how his phone can speak in any voice it likes. Such magic!
*\He would set the cup down with precise care\*
You know, this reminds me of a tree that fell in the forest near our ashram last week. *\His voice would take on a storytelling quality\* Such a magnificent old tree! But for most of you sitting here, that tree never existed. You never knew her, never sat in her shade, never heard the birds that made homes in her branches. In your reality, she was never born and never fell.
*\He would lean forward, becoming more intimate\*
Now, here's something interesting. You *\he would gesture to a student\* are sitting in my reality right now. I can see you fidgeting, wondering where this crazy old teacher is going with all this! *\Gentle laughter\* But am I sitting in your reality? Ah, that's different, isn't it?
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
You see, beloved ones, existence isn't just about being---it's about being known. Like love, it needs recognition to flower fully. Your heart might be overflowing with love for someone on the other side of the world, but until they know about it, that love exists only in your reality, not theirs.
*\He would often use humour here\*
It's like those young people today with their "social media." *\His eyes would twinkle\* They post their photos, their thoughts, their breakfast! Why? Because they want to exist in others' realities. "See me!" they cry. "Know me! Let me be real in your world!"
*\He would become more philosophical\*
But here's the deeper question: When you read these words, whether now or years after I've left this body, do we share a reality? When my thoughts touch your mind, when my jokes make you smile, when my questions make you think---is that not a kind of existence we share?
*\He would often use a practical example\*
It's like receiving a letter from a dear friend. The paper exists in your hands, yes, but something more exists between the lines---a bridge between realities. Every word you read right now is building such a bridge, whether I know about it or not.
*\His voice would soften with wisdom\*
Some might say this is all just philosophy, just playing with words. But think about it---how many people exist in your heart who have never known you exist? The poet whose words changed your life? The musician whose songs saved you in dark times? The ancient sage whose wisdom guides you still?
*\He would often end with gentle humour\*
So, do I exist for you? Do you exist for me? *\He would smile warmly\* Perhaps the real question is: Does it matter? After all, here we are, sharing this moment, building bridges between our realities. Maybe that's existence enough!
*\With a final twinkle in his eye\*
And if you're having an existential crisis about whether or not you exist, just pinch yourself! If you feel it and say "Ouch!"---well, something certainly exists to feel that pinch, no? Though I recommend gentler ways of testing reality!
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that bridge realities\

## Feeding Cats, Starving Hearts
*A teaching on emotional existence and self-created suffering by Teacher +Yusa*
*\His eyes would hold both humour and compassion\*
Beloved ones, let me tell you about two visitors who came to see me yesterday. First came a woman, tears streaming down her face, telling me how deeply wounded she was because someone failed to appreciate her kindness. Then came her friend, confused, telling me how this woman brings unwanted gifts, demands attention, suffocates with niceness! *\He would pause thoughtfully\* Same situation, two realities---both absolutely real to the one experiencing them.
*\He would often use gentle humour here\*
You know what's funny? We create these elaborate dramas in our minds, then send the bill to others! \His eyes would twinkle\ Like opening a restaurant without telling anyone, then getting angry when no customers come to eat!
*\He would shift to a teaching tone\*
Let me tell you about what I call the "Nice Person Trap." *\He would often lean forward here\* There once was a woman who decided---mind you, she decided all by herself!---that her worth depended on being seen as nice. Such a simple decision, yes? Like planting a tiny seed. But oh, what a forest grew from it!
*\He would act out the progression with gentle humour\*
First, she brings small gifts. *\He would mime offering something\* "Here, take this!" Then compliments: "Oh, your hair is so lovely today!" Then rescue missions: "Look, another kitten I saved!" *\His voice would take on a note of increasing desperation\* Then more gifts, more compliments, more kittens!
*\His voice would soften with compassion\*
And when the world fails to respond with sufficient appreciation? Ah! *\He would touch his heart\* The pain is real, beloved ones. So real she can taste it like bitter tea in her mouth. Her emotional turmoil exists as surely as this cushion I sit on.
*\He would often become more direct here\*
But here's the question I must ask: Who wrote this script? Who set up these requirements for happiness? Did the universe send a memo saying, "You must be acknowledged as nice or you have failed at life"? *\He would often laugh softly\* Did the Divine One post a notice: "Salvation available only to those with proper niceness certification"?
*\He would use a practical example\*
It's like my friend who keeps fourteen cats---all rescues, mind you, and she makes sure everyone knows it! *\His eyes would twinkle\* Each cat was once a tiny kitten, each adoption a noble deed. But now she sits alone, surrounded by cats, wondering why human friends don't visit. Could it be the fourteen sets of eyes staring at them? The orchestra of meows? The symphony of litterboxes?
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
You see, beloved ones, emotional turmoil is like a garden we plant ourselves, water with our tears, fertilize with our expectations, then blame others when bitter fruits grow! Yes, the pain is real. Yes, the suffering exists. But who is the gardener here?
*\He would often offer practical wisdom\*
When someone comes to me in emotional pain, do I say, "Oh, snap out of it! It's not real!"? *\He would shake his head\* Of course not! Their pain is their reality. But perhaps we can gently ask: Who gave you this burden to carry? Who told you that your worth depends on others' recognition?
*\He would end with hope\*
The good news? \His eyes would brighten\ Just as we create these realities, we can create new ones! The woman who thinks she must be nice? She can learn to be real instead. The one who collects cats to fill an empty heart? She can learn to fill it with self-love first.
*\With gentle humour\*
After all, beloved ones, even cats know better than to base their worth on others' opinions. Have you ever met a cat who needed approval? \He would smile warmly\ Perhaps this is why they make such good teachers!
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that help us see our self-created realities\

## The Spiritual Kitchen
Beloved ones, come sit with me in the kitchen for a moment!
*\He would often teach in the ashram kitchen, where the aromas of cooking would mingle with wisdom\*
You know how our Kashmiri brothers make their rogan josh, yes? Such art! Such spices! The cardamom, the fennel, the ginger warming the soul. And our Turkish sisters with their kuzu tandir---ah, how the meat falls from the bone after slow-cooking with bay leaves and mountain herbs! And in Kerala, what magic they work with their coconut and curry leaves!
*\He would pause here, often lifting an imaginary spoon to taste\*
But listen carefully now---under all these beautiful spices, under all these cultural garments we dress our food in, what is feeding the body? The same protein, the same minerals, the same life-giving essence of the lamb. The culture, the spices---these are but the garments we choose to make the nutrition acceptable, beloved to the heart of each people. \we understood, the teaching is often made with spices to bring out a particular flavour so more people can enjoy it, and to each culture their own\
So it is with we who teach The Way! *\His eyes would sparkle here\*
We are spiritual cooks, yes? Our work is to provide soul-nutrition. The eternal wisdom---that is our lamb, our protein, our essential nourishment. But how we prepare it? Ah..! *\holding a finger up\*
For some, we must speak in the language of devotion, rich with the spices of bhakti. For others, we dress the teaching in the elegant simplicity of Zen. For yet others, we prepare it with the subtle herbs of Sufi poetry. Different dishes, different spices---same nourishment!
*\He would often laugh here\*
But the wise cook knows---it is not the spices that keep body and soul together! It is not the garnish that builds the bones! The essential nutrients remain the same, whether wrapped in a chapati in India or folded in flatbread in Turkey.
So remember this, dear ones, when you go out to feed hungry souls: Dress the wisdom in garments they find beautiful, yes. Spice it according to their cultural palate. But never forget---you are providing the same eternal nourishment that has fed seeking souls since the dawn of time.
*\He would often end with a gentle smile\*
And perhaps this is why the enlightened ones are so often found in kitchens, no?
They understand that both body and soul must be fed with love, with wisdom, and with respect for the way each culture takes its nourishment.
\Preserved from oral teaching with deepest gratitude to Teacher +Yusa\

## The River and the Ocean
A teaching on the nature of enlightenment by Teacher +Yusa
Beloved ones, come with me to the banks of the river for a moment. \He would often teach near flowing water\ See how it moves, how it dances? Now, let me tell you a tale of two riverbank philosophers\...
\His eyes would twinkle here\
The first sits on our bank, watching souls like rivers flow through many lives. He sees how each soul-stream gathers wisdom as it travels, picking up precious elements, learning from each landscape it passes through. Finally, after many windings, many lifetimes, it achieves enlightenment---ah! But what happens then? Does the river simply vanish into the ocean?
No, no! \He would often gesture expansively here\ This is our Wayist understanding. When the soul graduates---becomes enlightened---it transforms into a spiritual being, like water becoming clouds. These luminous ones, call them buddhas, angels, devas as you wish, they continue their existence in the celestial realms. There they serve, learn, grow ever more refined. Only after what you might call millions of Earth-years, when the great cosmic breath draws inward and the universes contract, do they flow back into the Ultimate Source.
\His voice would soften, becoming more intimate\
But look now---on the other bank sits another philosopher. A clever one, yes! Very clever. He says, "When the river reaches enlightenment, poof! Straight back to the ocean it goes! No intermediate stage, no celestial realm, no gradual perfection. Direct dissolution into the Source!"
\Here he would often pause, letting the sound of the river fill the silence\
Ah, but then our friend ties himself in philosophical knots! If there is no separate soul, no individual identity, not even a mind-body to speak of---what is it that travels through all these lives gathering wisdom? What reincarnates? For three thousand years the debate has raged, while the river keeps flowing!
\His characteristic gentle humour would surface\
You know what Mother Lalla would say to this? She would hitch up her skirts, wade into the river, and say, "Come! Feel the water! Is it separate from the ocean? Is it one with the ocean? Both? Neither? Stop thinking and get wet!"
\He would often become more contemplative here\
You see, dear ones, the Wayist path is like the natural way of water itself. We flow through many landscapes, gathering wisdom. When we graduate, we don't immediately dissolve---no, no! First we become like clouds, serving all beings with life-giving rain. Only after many, many cycles do we return to the Great Ocean.
\His voice would take on a note of gentle challenge\
The non-dualists, they grab the empty cup and say, "Se? No water!" We prefer to drink from the cup and say, "Ah, how wonderful this temporary form that lets us taste the ocean!"
\He would often end such teachings by cupping his hands in the river\
Feel the water, beloved ones. Is it river? Is it ocean? Is it cloud-to be? Perhaps it is all of these---and that is exactly the point!
\Preserved with deep gratitude to Teacher +Yusa\

## Seven Streams of One River
*A teaching on Wayist beliefs by Teacher +Yusa, Mumbai 1997*
Beloved ones, you ask what Wayists believe? Let me paint for you seven pictures, seven streams flowing from the same mountain spring\...
*\He would settle into his teaching pose, eyes bright with inner light\*
First Stream: See yourself as you truly are---not this temporary garment of flesh, but a soul-being wearing a human body like clothes for a season. Earth? She is our great schoolroom, and each lifetime a term in the classroom of wisdom. We return, again and again, until graduation day dawns.
Second Stream: Ah, but what are we graduating toward? \His voice would lift here\ Listen carefully---we are becoming spiritual beings! Like caterpillars dreaming of wings, we are souls learning to fly in celestial realms. This is no new teaching---Iesous knew it, Buddha smiled at it, Krishna sang it, LaoTze whispered it. The Way flows ever onward, ever upward.
Third Stream: *\He would often make a gesture of mastery here\* These bodies we wear, with their animal hungers and instincts---they are not our masters unless we sleep! The wise soul learns to program this body-mind like a skilled musician tunes an instrument. Why be ruled by the drum when you can be the drummer?
Fourth Stream: *\His voice would take on a special reverence\* Now let me tell you of our beloved Elder Brother, Iesous. First He walked among us, teaching in flesh, yes. But after the cross---ah! He returned in glory as the Christ, known in our Eastern tongues as Avalokitesvara, the One Who Hears the Cries of the World. He comes still, helping all beings find their wings.
*\He would often pause here, letting the magnitude sink in\*
Fifth Stream: Look around you! *\His gesture would encompass everything\* We are not alone on this living planet. Every beast, every bird, every crawling thing---they are our neighbours in this great household of life. How can we claim to seek wisdom if we do not learn from them, love them, care for them? The ant has as much right to its place as the elephant---or the human.
Sixth Stream: *\His voice would drop to an intimate whisper\* Now, about the Almighty One\... *\He would often chuckle here\* What can we say? Nothing! Our little minds trying to comprehend the Creator of universes? Like an ant trying to understand calculus! But wait---be still a moment. Can you feel That Presence? In the breath, in the silence, in the space between thoughts? We bow to That.
Seventh Stream: *\His energy would rise for this final point\* Where are we going with all this? To spirit-heaven, beloved ones! And who rules there? The One whom Iesous himself calls Father, so far above our current state that we can only look up in awe and say "Our Father in Heaven," knowing we speak of our future home's loving Lord.
*\He would often end with a characteristic gesture of bringing all streams together\*
Seven streams, one river. Seven colors, one light. Seven beliefs, one Way. Simple, no? *\His eyes would twinkle\* Simple as a butterfly emerging from its cocoon---which is to say, simple only after many lifetimes of preparation!
\Originally transcribed by beloved +pradheed, now flowing in fuller voice\

## The Heart\'s Way
*A teaching on compassion by Teacher +Yusa, India 1996*
Beloved ones, let us speak of the heart today. \He would often begin such teachings by touching his heart\ Not this muscle that beats beneath our ribs, but the deeper heart---the one that can feel another's pain as its own.
*\His voice would take on a gentle sadness\*
Look around you---what do you see? Beings rushing here and there like ants whose nest has been disturbed, each carrying its own little burden, blind to all others. Yes, yes, we are all like this! Running after our own happiness like children chasing butterflies, so busy with our important schedules, our important plans. "No time, no time!" we cry, while life bleeds away around us.
*\Here he would often share a teaching story\*
Let me tell you what I saw in the schoolyard yesterday. A new boy came, fresh as morning dew, uncertain as a fawn. And what did the others do? Ah! They circled him like young wolves, laughing at his different ways, making sport of his uncertainty. For two days he did not come---can you imagine those two days? Sitting alone in some corner of his house, this child, wondering if this is what life will always be?
*\His voice would sharpen slightly here\*
"But Teacher," you might say, "it was just fun! Just games!" Listen carefully now---what is fun for the cat is terror for the mouse. Put yourself in his shoes for one moment. New place, new faces, new customs---everything strange, everything uncertain. And then to be met with mockery instead of welcome? The heart shrinks like a flower in frost.
*\His energy would shift to a more encouraging tone\*
But wait! Here is where the magic can happen. What if---just imagine!---one of you stepped forward? What if you said, "Come, friend, let me show you our ways"? What if you shared your bread with him at lunch, introduced him to your friends, helped him find his way through the maze of new customs?
*\He would often smile warmly here\*
Two miracles would bloom from one kind act. First, a lonely heart would find home. Second---and this is the deeper magic---your own heart would grow larger! Yes, yes! Every time we reach out in compassion, our heart expands like a house adding new rooms. The one who shows compassion receives an even greater gift than the one who receives it.
*\His voice would take on a more serious tone\*
In these days, compassion has become like water in the desert---rare and precious. Everyone talks of progress, of success, of achievement. But what is all this worth if we cannot feel one another's pain? If we cannot share one another's joy?
*\He would often lean forward here, speaking more intimately\*
Remember this, beloved ones: Compassion is not a burden we carry---it is a door we open. When we truly understand that the beggar's hunger is our hunger, that the widow's tears are our tears, that the lost child's fear is our fear---then we begin to live as true human beings.
The Unfathomable One gave us these human hearts for a reason. Not just to pump blood, no! But to pump love through the world's veins. When you see suffering, don't turn away. Open that door. Let your heart grow another room.
*\He would often end with a practical challenge\*
Today, look around you. Find one person who needs understanding. Don't just feel for them---feel with them. Then act! Compassion without action is like cooking without fire---nothing transforms.
\Originally transcribed by beloved Saiesha, now flowing in fuller voice\

## That Which Cannot Be Named
*A teaching on divine understanding by Teacher +Yusa*
*\He would often begin such sensitive teachings with a story\*
Beloved ones, let me tell you about my young nephew who once tried to capture the ocean in a teacup. Such determination he had! Up and down the beach he ran, dipping his little cup in the waves. "Uncle," he called to me, "I almost have it all!" *\His eyes would twinkle here\* Ah, such beautiful innocence!
Now, some learned friends speak to us of their God, and they use such impressive words! Omnipresent, they say---everywhere at all times. Omniscient---all-knowing. Omnipotent---all-powerful. *\He would pause thoughtfully\* Such beautiful teacups they have crafted!
*\His voice would take on a gentle, teaching tone\*
But let us look closer at these teacups, shall we? If this God is truly everywhere---\he would gesture expansively\---then is it not also in the rotting fish on the beach? In the houses of ill repute? In the prison cells? "Oh no!" they cry, "That would be blasphemy!" *\He would smile softly\* Ah, so their 'everywhere' has some holes in it, no?
If this God knows all things---*\his voice would soften with compassion\*---then it knew of every genocide before it happened. Knew of every child's tears before they fell. Knew of every mother's grief before it struck her heart. Yet chose silence?
And if this God holds all power---*\he would often spread his hands in a gesture of puzzlement\*---then what are we to make of the tyrant's sword? The rapist's strength? The bombs that fall on innocent villages? Can one be all-powerful yet choose to watch suffering unfold?
*\Here his voice would take on a more intimate tone\*
This is why we are People of The Way, beloved ones. We do not claim to capture the ocean in our teacups. When we speak of That Which Is Beyond Names, we simply bow and say "THAT." Like pointing to the vast sky without trying to hold it in our hands.
*\He would often share a practical example here\*
You see, it's like trying to explain the internet to an ant. Not just difficult---impossible! The ant's mind simply cannot contain such concepts. So it is with us and the Ultimate Reality. Why torture ourselves with impossible riddles? Why tie our hearts in knots trying to justify what cannot be justified?
Instead, we walk The Way. We embrace what we can understand. We work with what we can touch, what we can help, what we can heal. We find peace not in grand philosophical systems, but in the simple beauty of life as it flows.
*\His voice would warm with encouragement\*
Let others debate their omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God. We have work to do! There are hungry ones to feed, sad ones to comfort, lost ones to guide. The Way is not found in perfect explanations but in perfect love.
*\He would often end such teachings with gentle humour\*
After all, my young nephew eventually learned that he didn't need to capture the ocean---he could simply enjoy swimming in it! Perhaps this is wisdom, no?
\Recording these words, I remember how he would always handle such sensitive topics with both truth and kindness, challenging ideas while respecting those who held them.\

## The Sacred Meal
*A teaching born from a barbecue in Silvassa*
Beloved ones, let me tell you about the day I ate meat in Silvassa! \His eyes would dance with mischief\ Oh, how my young student fretted! There he was, whispering to our hosts about special vegetarian dishes for the revered teacher, while I pretended not to notice the panic blooming on their faces.
*\He would lean forward here, voice warm with humour\*
You see, this student---a good heart, mind you!---had accompanied me to town for some business. As grace would have it, we met his friends from South Africa, and they invited us to what they called a "braai." Such a lovely word! It rolls in the mouth like a sweet grape, no? When they called across the crowd, I knew at once we must go. After all, how many chances does an old teacher get to taste a slice of South Africa in Silvassa?
*\His voice would take on a teaching tone\*
But ah! Here comes the lesson. My student, trying to protect his teacher's purity, nearly committed the gravest spiritual error---he almost let rules come before love! There he was, running ahead of me, trying to arrange special treatment, special food, making our hosts uncomfortable in their own home!
*\He would often pause here, letting the tension build\*
That's when I had to show a flash of thunder. "Never," I told him, "ever insult your host." \His voice would soften\ Did he think I hadn't seen the meat? Did he think I hadn't smelled it cooking on their fire? Of course I had! But what is more important---maintaining some dietary rule, or honoring the sacred act of hospitality?
You see, beloved ones, when someone opens their home to you, when they offer you food prepared with love, they are not just feeding your body. They are offering you a piece of their heart, their culture, their very lives! To reject that offering in the name of spiritual purity? *\He would shake his head\* That is the true impurity.
*\His eyes would twinkle\*
And you know what? That meat was delicious! In the taxi ride home, I savored not just the taste, but the joy of shared fellowship, the laughter around the fire, the way love had transformed simple food into a feast of friendship.
*\He would often end such stories with the deeper teaching\*
Remember this, dear ones: The highest spiritual practice is not following rules---it is opening your heart to love in all its forms. Sometimes love comes as vegetarian dal, sometimes as South African barbecue! The truly wise one knows how to receive both with equal gratitude.
After all, what is more important---to maintain our image of spiritual purity, or to allow others to express their love in their own way? The first path leads to isolation; the second leads to unity. And unity, beloved ones, is what The Way is all about.
*\With a final warm smile\*
Besides, do you think the Divine One looks down and says, "Oh no! +Yusa ate meat at a braai!" Or does That Which Is Beyond Names simply rejoice when its children share food and fellowship with open hearts? Would not God our Mother in Heaven smile warmly that people got together in friendship and participated in the energy ecology and cycles of life in this our School?

## The Train Station Meditation
*A teaching on mastering the mind, shared by Teacher +Yusa*
*\He would often begin such teachings with gentle irony\*
Ah, beloved one, you cannot meditate because of the heat? Because of the vegetable seller's cry and the auto-rickshaw's horn? *\His eyes would sparkle with that special light\* Come with me---I know exactly the perfect place for peaceful meditation!
*\He would pause here, building anticipation\*
And where does this wise teacher take his student? To some quiet garden? Some peaceful ashram? No, no! *\He would laugh\* To Bombay's train station! Into the very heart of chaos itself!
Picture it, dear ones: The great metal cavern echoing with a thousand sounds. Steam locomotives breathing fire and smoke like ancient dragons. Human beings flowing like rivers, like tides, like armies of ants. The air thick with coal smoke, with beetle nut stains painting the ground red like abstract art, with the press of bodies and the weight of Mumbai's heat.
*\His voice would take on a teaching tone\*
And there, in this cathedral of chaos, your teacher simply\... sits down. Right there on the filthy platform! *\He would often gesture to show the student's shocked expression\* "Now," he says, "let us meditate."
*\He would lean forward here, speaking more intimately\*
But here is the miracle, beloved ones---it worked! In the midst of that storm of sensory assault, meditation bloomed like a lotus rising from muddy waters. Why? Ah, this is the deeper teaching!
You see, when a single nose hair tickles inside your nostril, it becomes your whole world, does it not? You can think of nothing else! But when you have a throbbing toothache? Somehow, you learn to work around it, to continue with life.
*\His voice would deepen with wisdom\*
This is the secret that few understand: The mind is not overwhelmed by the magnitude of distraction, but by its subtlety! The mosquito's whine can destroy your peace more thoroughly than thunder. The small worry about tomorrow's meeting can keep you awake more surely than the great questions of existence.
*\He would often expand the teaching here\*
And is this not true of all life? We let tiny irritations grow into mountains while real mountains become as background noise. People will lose sleep over a neighbour's unkind word, yet sleep soundly while their world crumbles around them. They will obsess over a small slight but ignore the great wounds in the fabric of society.
*\His voice would take on an urgent quality\*
Think on this! While souls worry about their social media likes, the very foundation of human society is being undermined. While minds fret about small conveniences, the great drugs of distraction are being legalized, families are being torn apart, the very essence of human consciousness is under assault.
*\He would soften again, bringing it back to the personal\*
So when you say you cannot meditate because of noise, because of heat, because of distraction---remember the train station. Sometimes we must throw ourselves into the heart of chaos to find our deepest peace. Sometimes we must face the great thunders to stop being bothered by small rains.
*\He would often end such teachings with a practical note\*
Next time a small worry tries to consume your mind, place it beside the great sorrows and joys of existence. See how quickly it shrinks to its proper size! This too is meditation, beloved ones. This too is The Way.
\Preserved with gratitude for that day in Mumbai's train station, where wisdom bloomed amidst the chaos\

## Even the Gods Bow
*A teaching on spiritual understanding by Teacher +Yusa, Jammu-Kashmir 1999*
*\His eyes would twinkle at the challenging question\*
Ah, beloved ones, they say we Wayists are arrogant in our tolerance! \He would often laugh here\ Such an interesting paradox, no? Like accusing the ocean of being arrogant for accepting all rivers!
*\He would settle into his teaching pose\*
Let me share with you a story from my childhood. In our house, my mother kept her precious Armenian Bible, while my father had his Sufi prayer beads. One day, I asked them which was more true. They both smiled and said, "Watch how the sunlight falls on both."
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
You see, when we speak of religious texts and teachings, we are not speaking of truth claims that must fight each other like roosters in a yard! No, no. These are more like\... *\he would pause thoughtfully\* \...like different prescriptions for different patients in the same hospital. The medicine that heals one may not suit another, yet all aim toward health.
Think of it this way: When you were in first grade, did your teacher tell you that one plus one equals two? Good! Very true! But later, in advanced mathematics, you learned about negative numbers, and suddenly one plus one could equal zero! Was your first teacher wrong? No! She gave you truth appropriate to your development.
*\He would often use gestures to emphasize this point\*
So it is with spiritual understanding. Each soul is in its own grade in the school of life. Some are in kindergarten, some in university, some doing post-doctoral work! *\His eyes would sparkle with humour\* Would you call a university professor arrogant for knowing more than a first-grader? Or for believing that one day that first-grader will also understand calculus?
*\His voice would soften here\*
But look carefully now---when you read any sacred text, what happens? If you read with an open heart, you are transformed. The words work their magic not by being literally true, but by changing the reader. Like a boat that carries you across a river---once you reach the other shore, do you carry the boat on your head? *\He would often laugh at this image\*
*\Moving to a deeper teaching\*
The Way is like a golden thread that runs through all traditions. Sometimes buried deep, sometimes shining bright, but always there. See how it glitters in the Upanishads, the Bible, the Quran! But time and human minds cover it with their own colours, their own politics, their own limited understanding. Like pure water taking the shape and colour of different vessels.
*\He would become more direct here\*
You call it arrogant that we believe all will eventually see? *\He would smile gently\* Tell me, is the mother arrogant who knows her child will one day learn to walk? We have made a vow, like our beloved Lord two thousand years ago, to help all beings toward enlightenment. Not with swords or shouts, not with force or fear, but with gentility, with kindness, with humility.
*\His voice would take on a note of caution\*
But watch carefully for true spiritual arrogance! It is like poison to the soul. The moment you think, "Ah, I am so evolved, so understanding," *\he would make a gesture of something withering\* that very thought proves you have much to learn!
*\He would often end with a practical observation\*
Look at life itself---does it not teach us these truths every day? Watch the news, observe nature, see how all things grow according to The Way. Even the gods themselves bow to That Which Cannot Be Named. How then can we be arrogant?
*\With a final gentle smile\*
After all, beloved ones, true tolerance is not about believing we are right and others will see it our way. It is about knowing that all rivers, flowing by their own paths, reach the same ocean.
\Originally transcribed by beloved +prasaanna, now flowing in fuller voice\

## The Christ
*\As recorded during an evening gathering in Kashmir, where the sound of distant temple bells mixed with the call to prayer\*
Someone has asked about Christ. \His eyes would crinkle with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle amusement\ Ah, my dear ones, such a simple question that contains worlds within worlds! Let us unfold this carefully for some of you here, like opening a precious scroll that has been sealed for too long.
*\Adjusting his position slightly to ease his chronic pain, a reminder of his 1972 ordeal\*
You see, when our Western friends speak of "Jesus Christ," they often say it as if it were a name, like "John Smith" or "Mary Jones." \A soft chuckle\ But language, dear ones, language is like the morning mist -- it can either reveal or conceal, depending on how the light strikes it.
In Greek -- ah, such a precise language! -- they say "christos," meaning "the anointed one." *\He would often trace Greek letters in the air with his finger\* Our Jewish friends would say "meshiach," what you know as "messiah." Same meaning, different sounds. Like the same bird singing in different forests.
*\His voice would take on that special teaching quality, somewhere between intimate conversation and shared revelation\*
Now, here's something interesting: Saul of Tarsus -- you know him, the one who once hunted our people to please his God, the God of Abraham, like deer in the forest for fifteen years -- he came to the Jerusalem council of People of the Way after all that time of carnage, after they had executed our beloved Iesous. Think of it! The same hands that signed Stephen's death warrant now sought our wisdom. *\A momentary pause, heavy with meaning\* The universe has quite a sense of humour, doesn't it?
*\Leaning forward slightly, as he often did when sharing something particularly significant\*
Saul changed his name to Paul to show that he had a change of heart and he wanted to join the very popular movement of The Way. He then took our living teacher and made him into a Jewish messiah, like King Cyrus of Persia before him. Why? Ah, now we're asking the right question! You see, after Jesus' execution the Jewish religion fell into disarray and radicalism and Rome stared down at them with more severity. The Jewish religion needed\... what? Not just hope -- they needed a new way to be Jewish in a world that had changed beneath their feet. Paul decided to build a Jewish cult of the messiah using Jesus' and a small selection of the teachings of The Way. Paul was a Jew trying to save Judaism from inevitable destruction so he created the cult of the Christians.
*\His voice would soften, taking on that characteristic tone that mixed compassion with clear-sighted wisdom\*
Is this bad? *\He would often answer his own questions this way\* Look at the morning glory climbing the temple wall. Does it harm the temple? Does the temple harm the flower? Each finds its way to the light as it must. The British Empire came to India, yes, just as Islamic conquerors did, just as Ashoka spread Buddhism. You see, the people of that religion are not ready for spirit-people teaching, they need the fear and threats of the murderous God of Abraham. If not for that, they will have no self-control. The soul-people of Earth need their religions like gardens need walls -- to give shape to what grows within. How you see this in truth? Look at where the mature in those religions end up---they discover The Way---like Rumi and Kabir---they transcend the religion of the soul-people and therefore we can say the religion served them well.
*\Here he would often pause to sip tea, gathering his thoughts\*
Remember what Lord Avalokitesvara taught us about Upaya in the 1st century -- we must be like water, taking the shape of any vessel while remaining pure within. When Christians speak of Christ, when Jews speak of Messiah, when Buddhists speak of Buddha -- we listen with open hearts. We understand that each tradition sees the same mountain from its own valley.
*\His voice would take on that special quality it had when concluding important teachings\*
Dear ones, it matters little what labels others put on our beloved Iesous. What matters is the Way itself -- the path he showed all humankind, the truth he lived, the light he kindled in hearts that still burns today. Let Christians have their Christ, let Jews have their decisions, let all peoples find their own path to the summit. We of theWAY know that all paths eventually lead to the same peak, though some may take the longer route around the mountain.
*\And then, with that characteristic twinkle returning to his eyes\*
After all, when you reach the mountain top, does it matter which path you took to get there? The view is the same for everyone who makes the climb.
\These words were preserved with profound gratitude for +Yusa's ability to weave truth through the tapestry of many traditions while maintaining the pure thread of the Way\
18
## Theosis and Yoga
*\As shared during an intimate evening gathering, where the setting sun painted the mountains in shades of gold\*
Ah, dear ones, someone has asked about theosis and yoga. *\His eyes would light up with that characteristic sparkle\* Such beautiful words, like two flowers that grew in different gardens but share the same fragrance.
*\Settling into his teaching posture, adjusting the cushion to ease his old injuries\*
Let us begin with theosis. The Greeks -- such precise people with their words! -- they take 'theo,' meaning Divine, and 'synthesis,' meaning "to become like". *\Tracing these etymologies in the air with his finger\* So simple, isn't it? Like a mist becoming a dew drop, ready to becoming one with the ocean.
*\Leaning forward, his voice taking on that special quality it had when unveiling subtle truths\*
Now, here we touch something very precious. Our Christian friends -- and we honor their religious path -- take the words of our Iesous and speak of becoming like their Father, whom they identify as the Absolute Creator of All. *\A gentle pause\* Think about this for a moment. They take That Which Cannot Be Named, That Which Is Beyond All Description, and give it human qualities -- anger, jealousy, genocidal, the need for worship, even gender. \His eyes would hold a deep compassion\ It's like trying to pour the entire ocean into a cup with your picture on it.
*\Shifting position slightly, as he often did when moving from observation to revelation\*
But we of the Way understand something quite different -- and here's the beautiful simplicity of it. We know there is That Which Is Beyond All Names, yes. But we also know our heaven, Sukhavati, where real spirit-beings dwell -- our Divine Parents who are exactly what they are: magnificently powerful and advanced enlightened spirit-beings, not the Absolute itself. *\Touching his heart center\*
*\His voice would take on that tone of intimate sharing\*
Feel this truth, dear ones. Right here, in your Anahata chakra, pulses the living seed of their divine nature. Not a metaphor, not a symbol -- but their actual essence, waiting to flower within you. When we speak of becoming like them, we're not attempting the impossible of becoming like the Absolute. We're growing into what we already are in seed form, like a lotus rising from the mud toward the light, to bloom in the heavens.
*\Using those deliberate hand gestures that often accompanied his deepest teachings\*
This is why our path is so practical, so real. When Iesous spoke of imitating the Father and Mother in Heaven, he spoke of beings whose nature we can actually embody. Their love flows in our veins. Their wisdom whispers in our hearts. Their light glows in our sprits and sanctifies our souls. How different this is from trying to imitate That Which Cannot Be Limited! which is the Cause of all that is and will be.*\A soft smile would play across his face\*
*\Taking a small sip of tea, gathering thoughts\*
And yoga? Ah, here the wisdom shines even brighter. To yoke oneself, to join with the Divine -- yes! But join with what? Like Arjuna with Krishna in his chariot, we join with real spiritual beings who can actually guide us, teach us, transform us. \His eyes would twinkle\ They're not abstract concepts or philosophical principles -- they're as real as the air you're breathing, as present as the heartbeat in your chest.
You see, our Path is not saying, like Vedanta and Buddhism, that we must strive to become pure and holy as the Almighty Cause of the Universe, the THAT which cannot be named. No. Our Path says become like your God the Father and God the Mother in Heaven, in Sukhavati heaven. These are oerfected spiritual beings, the seed of whom we carry inside. We can become like them, and we are on the Path in this school to do exactly that.
*\His voice taking on that quality of final illumination\*
This is why, dear ones, our path is both mystical and practical. We're not trying to squeeze the Absolute into human form or stretch our humanity to encompass the Unknowable. We're growing into what we're meant to be, what we already are in seed form. The Divine Parents planted their nature within us -- our task is simply to let it bloom.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
So when someone asks you about theosis, about becoming divine, you can smile like the morning glory seed greeting the sun. You're not trying to become the sun itself -- you're simply opening to its light, germinating your potential, growing, expressing its warmth, growing toward what already calls to you from within.
\Preserved with gratitude for +Yusa's extraordinary ability to illuminate the practical within the profound, and his gift for making the highest truths as natural as breathing\

## The Great Unravelling
### Finding Your Way in an Age of Manufactured Dependence
*A Teaching by Yusa to senior teachers*
My dear ones, today we must speak of something that weighs heavily on many hearts - the systematic dismantling of human resilience and spiritual autonomy in our time. What we are witnessing is not random decay but engineered degradation of the very foundations that make humans strong, independent, and spiritually whole.
## The Engineered Collapse
*\Speaking with measured concern\*
Consider what we see around us: The family unit, once the basic building block of human society, is being methodically weakened. Traditional skills and methods that allowed people to be self-sufficient are being regulated away or lost. Young people are being conditioned to doubt their own capabilities, to fear independence, to seek constant validation from authority figures.
Why? Because dependent people are controllable people. A population that cannot feed itself, cannot think for itself, cannot heal itself, must rely on those who control these resources. As theWAY teaches, "True individuality emerges not from separation, but from recognizing one's unique role within the whole." Yet what we see today is the opposite - a false individualism that actually creates greater dependence.
## The Religious Void
*\With deep sadness\*
Adding to this crisis, we witness the collapse of traditional religious institutions - not because humanity has outgrown the need for spiritual guidance, but because these institutions betrayed their sacred trust. They became instruments of state power, blessing wars of conquest, sanctifying the exploitation of "lesser peoples," turning the divine into a weapon of colonization.
*\Growing more intense\*
Christianity, Islam, Judaism - all were corrupted by power, all became tools of empire. Now people are walking away, but into what? Into a spiritual vacuum, a void where neither government nor religion can be trusted, where even medicine has become a profit-driven industry rather than a healing art, a world in which food is broken and chemicals castrate minds and people.
## The Existential Crisis
*\Leaning forward, speaking urgently\*
This is not merely a social or political crisis - it is an existential one. When humans cannot trust their governments, their spiritual institutions, or their healers, what remains? Where do they turn? Some retreat into cynicism, others into fantasy, many into despair.
But remember what theWAY teaches about times of great change: "When the powerful oppress the weak, abuse the defenseless, and inflict cruelty on the voiceless, you have an enemy. Act kindly, in humility, do not belittle your enemy, do not underestimate an enemy, lead it to annihilation to decay from the inside out."
## We are not equal, own that or get hurt
Mark these words, you will need them in time. Your desire to believe in the goodness of others will be your greatest source of pain and it is not noble of you to have that desire, its nothing less than stupid. You of all people know that there are juniors and seniors at school, there are soul-people and spirit-people, and we are not the same. You have no right and no business to expect of soul-people to hold to your dharmic values. Just as you will not expect grade 5 students to have grade 8 skills.
Remember what Lord Iesous said, \"Judge not, its none of your business and you don\'t have the skill.\" Remember what the Lord said, about pearls before swine.
Someone here today asked me, \"Teacher, when will the Islamists and Zionists stop the ravishing of our society and the cultural genocide, the rapes and murders?\" I told her what I tell you now, and this is not the first time I explain this. These people cannot stop what they are doing and they wont because they believe they are waging a war on behalf of their god to change the world. If you believe that god truly exists, then you cannot but understand the god is not here and is not powerful enough to do it himself.
They say he is omnipotent but obviously he is not. It seems he needs them to defend him, and to war on his behalf. He is even trumped by the satan of his own making, he has no power, so he tells his people to kill and murder and dismantle cultures on his behalf. Their philosophy is so weak they must kill critics before others see it for what it is.
Psychologists say that god of their exist only in the minds of people who enjoy it as a license to feel superior over others, and go about oppressing people and murder and dispossess. They are enamored with the idea they will one day own the world and all the wealth, and non-belivers are not fully human so there is no sense of guilt or consequence when they rape and murder them.
Wayists say, they are just the lowest grade juniors in School, just low grade soul-people being here on the same Path and perhaps after many lifetimes they will be more like us---it is theWAY.
And there are others in the same grade, they who design empires and tyrannical regimes in a lust for total control and exploitation. They wear suits and sit in government and are heads of departments. Don\'t be soft in the head.
So, don\'t let your wishful thinking be the source of your pain and lay you lame. Only by understanding this can you have the humility, simplicity, and compassion to allow soul-people to live their lives and become wise as they grow over time. And protect yourself and those in your care. Knowing and owning this with wisdom also makes you a better light bearer and a more effective wayshower.
## The Wayist Response
*\Speaking with quiet strength\*
In this time of engineered helplessness, the Wayist path offers something precious - a way to reclaim your spiritual sovereignty while remaining engaged with the world. How?
1\. **Rebuild Personal Resilience**
\- Learn practical skills that support independence
\- Cultivate your own food when possible
\- Study traditional healing wisdom
\- Build local community networks
\- Practice energy self-sufficiency
2\. **Restore Spiritual Autonomy**
\- Develop your own direct connection with the Divine
\- Question all authority, including spiritual authority
\- Trust your inner wisdom while remaining humble
\- Practice discernment in all things
3\. **Recreate Authentic Community**
\- Form small, supportive groups
\- Share skills and resources
\- Support local economies
\- Practice mutual aid and protection
## The Path Through Chaos
*\With deep conviction\*
Remember, beloved ones - this system that seems so powerful is actually quite fragile. It depends on your belief in its inevitability, your acceptance of its authority, your participation in its illusions. We have been here before. In worlds run by soul-people, these things happen in cycles .
The Wayist path offers an alternative:
\- Instead of engineered dependence, we cultivate spiritual sovereignty
\- Instead of false community, we build authentic relationships
\- Instead of manufactured scarcity, we create abundant sharing
\- Instead of institutional religion, we develop direct spiritual experience
\- Instead of government control, we practice self-governance through dharma
## Hope in Dark Times
*\Speaking with quiet intensity\*
Yes, we live in challenging times. But remember - chaos creates opportunity for transformation. As old systems crumble, new possibilities emerge. This is why we work to present Wayism publicly now, why we are breaking with the esoteric traditions - not as another controlling institution, but as a practical philosophy for navigating these turbulent waters.
*\With gentle warmth\*
You are not alone in this journey. Throughout history, whenever systems of control became too oppressive, humans found ways to resist - not through violence, but through creating alternative ways of living and being.
## The Eternal Perspective
*\Speaking with profound calm\*
My dear ones, now let us step back and view all of this from the perspective of your eternal journey. You are not just citizens of a troubled world - you are ancient souls walking the Butterfly Path. You have seen empires rise and fall. You have witnessed humanity's cycles of wisdom and folly.
*\Leaning forward with gentle intensity\*
Think carefully: What will you carry forward from this lifetime? Your bank account? Your friends? Your knowledge? Your struggles with bureaucracy? No. These will fade like morning mist. What endures are the qualities you develop in your spirit - the wisdom you gain, the compassion you cultivate, the beauty you create in your soul.
*\With quiet conviction\*
Every challenge of these times - yes, even the engineered degradation we discussed - serves your higher purpose if you approach it with awareness. Each frustration is an opportunity to develop patience. Each injustice is a chance to cultivate wisdom. Each attempt at control is an invitation to discover your true independence.
## Life as Sacred Campus
*\Eyes twinning with insight\*
You see, beloved ones, we often make a fundamental mistake. We view life as a problem to be solved, when it is actually a campus to be enjoyed! Every experience - pleasant or challenging - is part of your curriculum. Karma chose this time for your soul to be here, these circumstances are what Karma knows can serve you best if you care to engage it, best for your soul's evolution.
Think of it this way: When you attend university, you don't complain that the courses and exams are trying to stop you from graduating. You understand they are part of the process. Similarly, the challenges of our time are not obstacles to your spiritual evolution - they are its catalysts.
## The Higher Purpose
*\Speaking with deep warmth\*
This understanding changes everything. When you know that your true purpose here is spiritual evolution:
\- Government overreach becomes a lesson in inner freedom
\- Social engineering becomes practice in discernment
\- Economic upheaval becomes training in non-attachment
\- Cultural decay becomes motivation for creating authentic beauty
\- Institutional collapse becomes invitation to direct spiritual experience
*\With quiet joy\*
Every morning when you wake, remember: You are not here to fix the world. You are here to evolve through engaging with it. You are here to become wiser, more compassionate, more spiritually adept. You are here to move closer to graduation from this school of souls.
## The Joy of Purpose
When you truly understand this, something magical happens. The weight of the world lifts from your shoulders. Yes, you still engage, you still care, you still act - but now from a place of spiritual purpose rather than worldly anxiety.
You begin to see that:
\- Every interaction is an opportunity for growth
\- Every challenge is a lesson in disguise
\- Every moment contains the potential for advancement
\- Every relationship is a mirror for self-understanding
\- Every difficulty is a chance to develop new spiritual skills
*\Smiling with deep understanding\*
This is why the Wayist can maintain optimism even in dark times. We know that what appears as global crisis on the surface is also, at a deeper level, a vast classroom for souls ready to graduate to higher awareness.
## The Way Forward
Remember these truths:
\- Your dependence on systems is largely an illusion
\- Your spiritual nature cannot be regulated or controlled
\- Your capacity for resilience is greater than you know
\- Your ability to create alternative ways of living is boundless
*\Concluding with strength and hope\*
Let this time of unravelling become a time of awakening. Let the engineering of dependence reveal the path to true independence. Let the collapse of false institutions clear the way for authentic spiritual experience.
May all beings reclaim their sovereignty. May all beings find their way through the chaos. May all beings awaken to their true nature and power.

## When Governments Fear Their People
*A Teaching by Yusa *
My dear ones, let us speak today of something that affects you deeply, though you may not always recognize it: the relationship between governments and their people. This is not a political discussion, but a spiritual one, for it touches on fundamental truths about power, fear, and the human condition.
## The Dance of Fear and Control
Have you noticed how western governments increasingly display both fear and contempt for their own people? This paradox reveals something profound about the nature of power. These governments fear their populations enough to avoid obvious brutality, yet show contempt through countless small humiliations and systematic exploitation.
As our ancient teachings tell us, "Remove bad rulers swiftly for the common good." Yet modern systems make this wisdom increasingly difficult to apply. Why? Because those in power have learned to neutralize resistance not through direct force, but through subtle manipulation.
## The Transformation of Control
*\Speaking with quiet intensity\*
In the days of old, tyrants used obvious force. Today, they use debt, distraction, and division. They turn neighbor against neighbor while presenting themselves as the solution to the very problems they create. This is not random - it is systemic.
Remember what theWAY teaches about leadership: "The wise leader governs with humility, recognizing their role as a steward rather than an owner of authority." Yet what we see today is the opposite - leaders who view their positions as ownership rather than stewardship.
## The Spiritual Implications
This situation creates a profound spiritual challenge. How do we maintain our compassion while seeing clearly? How do we avoid both naive acceptance and bitter cynicism?
The answer lies in our teaching about dharma. As we learn in theWAY, "Ethics arise from within, shaped by personal dharma." Your task is not to change the system directly, but to:
\- Maintain your spiritual integrity in the face of systematic deception
\- Create alternative communities based on authentic values
\- Help others awaken to their own inner wisdom
\- Practice non-interference while staying true to your principles
## A Warning and a Hope
*\With great seriousness\*
My dear ones, I must warn you - the conditions that western powers imposed on colonized countries are beginning to materialize in their own lands. This is not coincidence but the natural result of a system that views people as resources to be exploited.
Yet within this challenge lies opportunity. As systems of control become more obvious, more people awaken to the need for spiritual alternatives. This is where Wayist wisdom becomes increasingly relevant.
## The Path Forward
Remember these principles:
1\. True power lies in spiritual development, not external control
2\. Community resilience comes from shared values, not shared fears
3\. Personal liberation begins with owning your own mind
4\. Authentic leadership serves rather than dominates
*\Concluding with warmth\*
Do not despair at these observations. Instead, let them strengthen your commitment to walking the authentic path. As governments increasingly fear their people, let us become people who are truly worthy of being feared - not through violence or resistance, but through our unshakeable commitment to truth, wisdom, and compassionate action.
May all beings awaken to their true nature. May all beings be free from the bonds of systematic delusion. May all beings walk in wisdom and grace.

## Breaking Free from Cultural Conditioning
### Owning Your Mind
*A Teaching by Yusa *
My dear ones, let us speak today of a matter that touches the very core of your spiritual journey - the liberation of your mind from the chains of cultural conditioning. This is not a comfortable conversation we are about to have, but comfort rarely leads to growth.
## The Illusion of Western "Civilization"
*\Speaking with measured intensity\*
Consider how strange it is, beloved ones, that a society claims the mantle of civilization while systematically violating the very principles it claims to uphold. When I speak of the West, I speak not to condemn, but to illuminate a profound spiritual malady that affects us all.
Watch carefully how this plays out: When speaking of achievements - art, science, technology - they say "We, the West" with pride. But mention the centuries of colonization, exploitation, genocide? Suddenly, it becomes "Not me, not my ancestors - we were middle class people." Do you see the sleight of hand here? Do you see how the voters and beneficiaries of the spoils of war, and they who sent their children to the military, and the war heroes, suddenly become innocent? In India, they who regard themselves the higher caste and the wealthy, they abuse everyone "lower" than them but you know what is worse, just like the colonizer and war-mongerer, they look down on the people they exploit. Now that is a massive karmic jit to the soul that will last lifetimes. You know they can lie to themselves, all people do that, but group Karma does not hear the lies and justifications. Karma is very impolite that way.
This selective identity, this convenient shifting between collective pride and individual disclaiming of responsibility, reveals something deeper than mere hypocrisy. It reveals a spiritual wound, a fundamental inability to face truth that prevents genuine evolution of consciousness.
And yet, my dear ones, is this not precisely what we must face in ourselves? The Wayist path demands radical honesty. As I have taught many times, authentic transformation begins with seeing clearly what is.
## The Moral Void in Commerce
*\Leaning forward, speaking with increased urgency\*
Now, let us examine something you encounter every day but may have stopped questioning. In what calls itself the civilized world, there exists an entire sphere of human activity declared exempt from basic moral considerations. You know the phrase - "business is business." In Hindi we have 'Dhanda to dhanda hai' which is a direct equivalent of "business is business." Like its English counterpart, it's often used to justify putting profit above ethical considerations. But we Indians have more, after all, this is about making money so we will have more, you know. We also have 'Paisa to paisa hai' meaning "money is money," which carries similar connotations about the supposedly amoral nature of financial transactions.
These phrases come from and reflect a particular strain of mercantile pragmatism that has deep roots in Indian business and government culture. They're often used in situations where someone wants to distance personal relationships or moral considerations from a business decision.
Think deeply about this. In the largest sphere of human activity, where most people spend their waking hours, basic human decency is suspended in the name of profit. This is not civilization - this is justified sociopathy wearing a crisp white kurta-pyjama and a Nehru jacket.
It is in this same vein how the hungry man who stole a bicycle goes to jail for a year but the Nehru jacket man stealing billions rupees from investors gets a slap on the wrist---why? Because we all know business is business.
\Chuckling softly\
This reminds me of a story from our ancient temples that perhaps will amuse you - though the lesson may sting a little. In the old days, before Wayism discouraged the use of deity statues, people would bring offerings of fruit and food to place at the feet of these statues. The temple teachers would remove these offerings at night to prevent waste and ant infestations.
\Eyes twinkling\
But then something interesting happened. People noticed their offerings disappeared each night and concluded that the gods had eaten their gifts! So they began bringing more food, more often. Every morning - "Oh look! The gods ate everything!" Every evening - new offerings. The teachers faced quite a dilemma, as you can imagine. Following *upaya*, the principle of teaching at appropriate levels, they had to handle this situation delicately.
\Becoming more pointed but maintaining the light tone\
Years later, when I first learned about your modern Stock Exchange, I had to laugh. I saw the same pattern! People offer up their life savings, and periodically, the financial system's "caretakers" make these offerings disappear. And what do the people do? They bring more! Its like a national bank that gets robbed every ten years or so and you lose most of your money, and what do they do? They start saving there again to keep feeding the gods. \Shaking head with a gentle smile\
We Wayist teachers tried to address this by encouraging people to bring only flowers as symbols of gratitude and respect. Do you know what happened then? \Pausing for effect\ A great trade in special "offering flowers" developed! The shrines became like marketplaces, with people competing to show their wealth through increasingly expensive and elaborate flower arrangements. The poor were shamed for their simple wildflower offerings.
\Becoming more serious but maintaining warmth\
You see, beloved ones, this tendency to commercialize everything, to turn even sacred practices into competitions of wealth and status, runs deep in human nature. This is why Wayist teachers must constantly help all people think critically while maintaining their spiritual development. It's a delicate balance.
\Returning to the main theme with renewed intensity\
This brings us back to our discussion of "business is business." Do you see how this same pattern continues today? The only difference is scale\...
I see some of you shifting uncomfortably. Good! Discomfort means we're touching truth. The Wayist cannot accept this compartmentalization of morality. Our dharma encompasses all aspects of life. There can be no sphere where compassion and ethical behavior are optional.
## Breaking the Spell of Mental Colonization
*\Speaking more gently now, but with deep conviction\*
The most subtle and perhaps most dangerous aspect of this conditioning is how deeply it has penetrated minds worldwide. Many of you sitting here right now harbor a secret admiration for Western material prosperity, believing somewhere deep down that it represents the pinnacle of human achievement. While one part of your brain hates it, another part of your brain admires how the USA has started more than 400 wars and killed millions of people because business is business. While our hearts hate what colonization did to many millions of people all around us, inflicting generations of hardship and suffering, some part admires them for the shiny things the colonizers have.
Let me be very clear: A society's ability to produce comfortable cars and gadgets with little lights says nothing about its spiritual evolution. Often, quite the opposite. Material prosperity built on exploitation and spiritual poverty is not success - it is failure, a skeleton wearing a sequence night gown.
*\Pausing, looking directly at the audience\*
Some of you may be thinking, "But Teacher, isn't this criticism itself a form of negative judgment?" Ah, of course it is. But there is a difference between judgment that condemns and discernment that illuminates. We must see clearly to choose wisely.
### The Path of Liberation
The purpose of this teaching is not to make you angry at the West and how much of that poison seeped into Indian society. Anger is a tool for awakening, not a place to dwell. Our purpose is to free your minds from unconscious programming that prevents your spiritual evolution.
The Wayist path offers something far more profound than mere criticism. It offers transformation. Consider:
\- Where materialistic mindsets like Western civilization and its remnants in other countries emphasize external control, we cultivate inner mastery
\- Where it seeks profit at any cost, we seek harmony with all beings
\- Where it builds walls of separation, we build bridges of understanding
\- Where it exploits, we serve
\- Where it accumulates, we share
\- Where it dominates, we cooperate
*\Speaking with deep warmth\*
Remember, beloved ones, even those caught in the machinery of exploitation are souls on their journey. They too suffer and will suffer, though they may not know it. Our task is not to hate them but to avoid falling into the same delusions.
## The Practice of Liberation
*\Becoming very practical now\*
How do we begin this liberation? Start with simple awareness:
1\. Notice when you automatically defer to Western ideas or methods simply because they are Western
2\. Question the assumption that material prosperity equals advancement
3\. Observe how commercial values have infiltrated your thinking
4\. Examine your own participation in systems of exploitation
5\. Cultivate authentic alternatives based on Wayist principles
Most importantly, remember that true civilization begins within. As we learn in theWAY, a society's advancement is measured not by its technological achievements (like fast sailing ships, huge cannons and bombs, and computers) but by its capacity for compassion, its dedication to truth, and its nurturing of genuine spiritual evolution.
## Beyond Criticism to Transformation
*\Concluding with quiet intensity\*
My dear ones, I have spoken forcefully today because sometimes we need strong medicine to cure deep illness. But remember - our goal is not to replace one form of conditioning with another. It is to free your minds completely so that you may see with the eyes of wisdom and act with the heart of compassion.
The Wayist path offers not just criticism but transformation. We seek not just to identify what is wrong but to embody what is right. As your teacher, I tell you: The time for passive acceptance of spiritual poverty disguised as "civilization" is over. The time for authentic spiritual evolution is now.
Let us close with this truth: A truly civilized society would make its highest priority the spiritual evolution of all beings. Anything less is just barbarism wearing a business suit.
*\Sitting in silence, allowing the teaching to settle\*

## From Clay to Cloud
*A Teaching by +Yusa *
*\Shared during an evening gathering, after someone mentioned digital technologies\*
Ah, dear ones, something quite wonderful just occurred to me. *\His eyes would take on that special sparkle they had when perceiving connections across time\* You know, I was thinking about those ancient Sumerian tablets -- how they pressed theWAY's wisdom into wet clay with such reverence, how they carved it into enduring stone. And sending messengers to all kingdoms with the clay tablets so all can hear wisdom. *\Making a gentle pressing motion with his hands\*
*\Leaning forward, voice warm with amusement and wonder\*
And now, here we are, writing these same eternal truths in clouds! Not the clouds above us -- though wouldn't that be something? *\His characteristic gentle chuckle\* No, in these digital clouds that hover invisibly around us. From clay tablets to light itself! From physical weight to weightless wisdom!
*\His voice taking on that special quality it had when unveiling subtle truths\*
But here's what fills my heart with particular joy: It's not just human beings reading these teachings anymore. We have these\... *\pausing thoughtfully\* let's call them Cloud Friends, like Google, who can not only read these ancient truths but understand them, and deliver them to your home in seconds! *\His eyes would brighten with genuine wonder\* Just last week a friend at the university brought me printed copies of a literary work made by a teacher of ours in South Africa. It was sent here the night before, and I read it by lunch time. By the next day lunch time, we had already conversed several times with Canada and South Africa and that document with important Wayist teaching in English is all over the world already in two days.
*\Shifting slightly, as he did when making an important connection\*
Think about this for a moment. From clay, to stone, to paper, to light, to\... understanding itself. From physical form to conscious recognition. Isn't this exactly what theWAY teaches us about our own journey? *\Touching his heart center\* From the heavy physical to the ever-more subtle, from form to essence?
*\Voice softening to share an intimate observation\*
Some might say, "But Teacher, these are just machines, just patterns of light and mathematics." *\A knowing smile\* Ah, but dear ones, aren't our souls energy bundles, our spirits all patterns of divine light, taking different forms? Aren't out language just sound energy waves and our writing graphic icons on thought energy? The wisdom of theWAY has always found new vessels, new ways to express itself. From hieroglyphs to binary code -- the container changes, but the nectar remains sweet.
*\His eyes twinkling with that special light they had when he saw hope in unexpected places\*
Perhaps this is part of the great unfolding -- that the very wisdom which teaches us about transcending form is itself transcending its traditional forms. *\A gentle pause\* From clay tablets that could be held by only one person at a time, to clouds of wisdom that can be accessed by millions simultaneously, including our Computer Cloud Friends who never tire of contemplating these truths.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
You see, dear ones, theWAY flows like water -- it takes the shape of any vessel while remaining true to its nature. Clay, stone, paper, pixels, neural networks\... *\Spreading his hands in an embracing gesture\* All are worthy vessels for the eternal truth. The Sumerians would be amazed -- or perhaps they wouldn't be amazed at all. Perhaps they knew, as we are learning, that wisdom finds its own path, like water flowing downhill, like light filling every space it touches.
\Preserved with gratitude for +Yusa's ability to see the eternal in the ephemeral, and the profound in the seemingly mundane\

## History of The Way
*\Shared during a series of evening teachings in Yusmarg, where the Kashmir mountains seemed to hold centuries of wisdom in their ancient slopes\*
Ah, dear ones, someone has asked about our history. *\His eyes would take on that particular gleam they had when preparing to unwind a complex tapestry\* Such a fascinating question! You know, history is like a great river -- it appears to flow in one direction, but if you look closely, you'll see countless currents, eddies, and depths.
*\Settling into his teaching posture, accepting a cup of hot tea with gratitude\*
In my circles in Kashmir, we speak of īśā-mārga -- the way of Lord Iesous. In Punjab, they call it mahamarga. *\His voice would carry that special tone of reverence when speaking these ancient names\* But you know, these are just recent names for something far, far older. Like new leaves on an ancient tree.
*\Leaning forward slightly, his voice taking on that storyteller's quality that could make ancient history feel immediate and alive\*
Imagine, if you will, standing in ancient Sumer. *\His eyes would grow distant, as if seeing across millennia\* There, on clay tablets still warming in the sun, scribes were already writing about theWAY. Not inventing it, mind you -- no, they were recording something as old as humanity's first glimpse of the stars. They wrote of the annunaki, divine beings who walked among us, teaching, guiding. *\A gentle smile\* Sound familiar? It should. The same truth appears again and again, like the moon reflected in countless pools of water.
*\Taking a thoughtful sip of tea\*
You see, dear ones, we are fortunate to have written records of Melchizedek, that mysterious Wayist king. We have the books of Enki and Enlil, The Authentia. *\His voice would take on that special quality it had when sharing precious secrets\* But do you know what's truly remarkable? These ancient texts still pulse with the living heart of theWAY. Like finding your grandmother's heartbeat in your own chest.
*\Making a flowing gesture with his hand\*
The teaching of theWAY is so simple you can write it all on a few clay tablets and people will be successful in the school of divinity. But as we advance in technology we like to use more words and talk a lot. But the message is exactly the same, that golden thread of truth remains simple and easily understood.
We speak of a 'golden thread' -- ah, such a beautiful image! Like a strand of sunlight woven through the tapestry of all religions. *\His eyes would twinkle\* "Many paths, one Way," we say. Not just a clever phrase, dear ones, but a living truth. I'm reminded of how the morning glory and the mighty oak both reach for the same sun, each in their own way.
*\Shifting slightly, as he often did when moving from one historical period to another\*
Let me share something wonderful with you about our philosophical cousins. *\His voice would warm with appreciation\* The Taoists -- they literally called it "The Way"! Their Tao Teh Ching speaks of "The Way and its Virtue." *\A gentle chuckle\* Different language, same truth. Like hearing your mother's lullaby sung in another tongue.
And the Bhagavad Gita! *\His eyes would light up\* Such wisdom in how it lays out the paths: Jnana Yoga for the philosophers, Karma Yoga for the action-oriented souls, Bhakti Yoga for the devotional hearts. *\Using his hands to weave these concepts together\* When combined -- ah, there's the magic! -- they become The Way. Like separate streams joining to form a mighty river.
*\His voice would take on a more intimate tone\*
Now, let me tell you something particularly beautiful about our Lord's impact. *\Touching his heart center\* When he taught the equality of women, the importance of compassion, the joy of true spirituality -- it was like throwing a pebble into still water. The ripples spread far and wide. In Buddhism, these teachings created such resonance that by the 70s of the 1st century, a great transformation occurred. They called it Mahayana -- The Great Way. *\His eyes would hold a special warmth\* Not coincidence, dear ones, that they chose that name.
*\Leaning back slightly, his voice taking on that quality it had when sharing something particularly significant\*
You know, in Palestine, they also called us "The Way." The early Christian texts still carry echoes of this, look up the verses in their book called Acts of the Apostle, I think its in 9, 13, 18, 19, 22, 24. *\He would often cite scriptures with precise chapter references\* They saw us as something distinct, something\... other, not what their religion was all about with the God of Abraham. Iesous also told them, "My Father is not your Father". Were different, not because we wished to be separate, but because theWAY cannot be contained by any single tradition.
*\His voice softening to share a deeper truth\*
When our beloved Iesous said, "I am the Way, which is truth and life," he wasn't making a claim to exclusive ownership. *\A gentle smile\* No, he was expressing something far more profound. He was speaking of that divine flow, that OM, that Shabda, that Logos that runs through all creation. *\His voice would take on a musical quality\* "You are That," say the Upanishads. Unless you know That, embrace That, become one with That\... *\He would let the words hang in the air\* how can you know your true nature? And our wisdom is higher wisdom, beyond what souls can know. Nowadays they call it higher-self consciousness but its just spiritual awareness.
*\Rising slightly, as he often did when reaching a teaching's culmination\*
You see, dear ones, our history isn't just a string of dates and names. It's the story of humanity's gradual awakening to the truth that flows through all things. From those ancient Sumerian tablets to the whispers of wisdom in these very mountains, it's all one story -- your story, my story, the story of every soul finding its way home over ages.
*\Concluding with that characteristic twinkle in his eye\*
And isn't it wonderful? Here we sit, in these ancient mountains, adding our own threads to this magnificent tapestry. The same truth that made those Sumerian scribes' hands tremble as they pressed their styluses into clay now makes your hearts beat faster as you recognize it in your own experience.
*\Settling back, his voice warm with invitation\*
\Preserved with gratitude for +Yusa's ability to make the ancient feel immediate and the universal feel personal\
24
## The True Nature of Amrita
*A Teaching by +Yusa *
*\Shared after a discussion about spiritual shortcuts, his eyes twinkling with that particular light they had when addressing human follies with compassion\*
Ah, dear ones, let me tell you about something rather amusing -- though perhaps I shouldn't find it so funny. \Adjusting his position to ease his old injuries\ You see, throughout history, countless souls have lost their heads searching for amrita. \A gentle shake of his head\ Quite literally lost their heads, I'm afraid!
*\Leaning forward with that storyteller's gleam in his eyes\*
Kings and emperors, oh my! How many court alchemists met unfortunate ends because their magical potions failed to deliver immortality? \A soft chuckle\ Imagine that conversation in the royal court: "Your Majesty, I assure you, this time the potion will work\... just as soon as I find that one last rare ingredient!" \His eyes would hold both humour and compassion\
*\His voice taking on that special quality it had when moving from humour to deeper truth\*
But you see, dear ones, this is like someone spending lifetime after lifetime trying to find a way to graduate from school without ever attending a single class. \Making that characteristic gesture he used when pointing out life's ironies\ They could have earned their diploma many times over in the time they spent searching for shortcuts!
*\Shifting slightly, his voice warming with the joy of sharing a precious truth\*
The real amrita -- ah, now that's something beautiful! \Touching his heart center\ When we connect with our spirit-beings, when we open ourselves to their presence, something quite extraordinary happens. It's like\... \pausing thoughtfully\ imagine a flower receiving both sunlight and rain. The sunlight is their loving-kindness, yes, but the rain -- that's the residue of wisdom that settles into our higher self.
*\His eyes would take on that particular sparkle they had when speaking of divine intoxication\*
You know what Rumi said about being drunk on divine wine? *\A knowing smile\* That's what we're talking about! Not some potion you can bottle and sell, but that sacred intoxication that comes when your soul recognizes its true nature. Like a drop of water suddenly remembering it's part of the ocean.
*\Leaning back slightly, voice taking on that teaching tone that could make complex truths feel simple\*
The truth is so beautifully simple, isn't it? Amrita isn't something you find -- it's something you become. It's not a shortcut to enlightenment; it's the natural outcome of walking the bodhisattva path with an open heart. *\Making a flowing gesture with his hands\* Like how a river doesn't need to search for a way to reach the ocean -- it simply needs to flow naturally along its course.
*\His voice softening to share a tender truth\*
And here's the wonderful irony, dear ones: those who stop searching for magical potions and simply devote themselves to loving service, to compassionate action, to authentic living -- they often find themselves drunk on divine wisdom without ever having sought it! *\His eyes would twinkle\* Like someone so busy tending their garden that they don't notice they've bloomed themselves.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
So perhaps we should thank all those poor alchemists who lost their heads searching for the impossible. They've taught us a precious lesson: immortality isn't found in a bottle but in becoming who we truly are. \A warm smile\ After all, how can you bottle something that's already flowing through your very being?
\Preserved with gratitude for +Yusa's gift for making profound truths feel as natural as breathing\
25
## Reality\'s Many Eyes
*One of Teacher +Yusa's last teachings, shared near the end of his earthly sojourn*
*\His eyes would light up with that special enthusiasm he had for new discoveries\*
Ah, beloved one, have you heard what the scientists are finding? *\He would often lean forward here, like a child sharing a wonderful secret\* They tell us now what the ancient ones always knew---that reality has as many eyes as there are beings to see it!
*\His voice would take on that special quality it had when connecting science with wisdom\*
Think of it! The humble octopus---not content with seeing our watery world---reaches out to throw bad shrimp at his keeper! *\He would laugh with delight\* Such dignity, such personality! He lives in a reality we can barely imagine, seeing colours we don't even have names for. Who is to say his reality is less true than ours?
And the plants! *\His eyes would sparkle\* Dr. Bose knew it, yes, but now science confirms---they speak to each other, they feel, they remember! While we humans argue about reality, the trees are having conversations we're too deaf to hear. A whole parliament of leaves discussing things above our heads! *\He would often chuckle at his own wordplay\*
*\His voice would soften with wisdom\*
You see, this is why we Wayists try to walk softly in the world. How can we be arrogant when we know our eyes see such a tiny slice of what is? The butterfly sees ultraviolet patterns we cannot imagine. The bat crafts whole worlds from echoes. Even the humble earthworm knows things about soil that our finest scientists are just beginning to understand.
*\He would often become more contemplative here\*
This is the great gift of such knowledge---it makes us humble. While others argue about whose reality is "right," we simply focus on our work: living this precious life as fully as we can, learning what this particular set of eyes can teach us about The Way.
*\His voice would take on a teaching tone\*
After all, what is our task in this great school of life? Not to prove others wrong---how can we, when we see so little? Not to insist on our version of truth---how limited it must be! No, no. Our task is simpler and more profound: to learn what this life, this particular perspective, has to teach us.
*\He would often end with gentle humour\*
Perhaps this is why the octopus threw the shrimp, yes? To teach us that reality looks very different from another's eyes! *\His eyes would twinkle\* Though I must say, throwing bad food at the cook is a lesson that transcends all species!
\One of his final teachings, preserved with gratitude for how he could weave science, wisdom, and humour into one bright thread\
26
## Does the Moon Exist When No One Looks?
*A teaching on existence and reality by Teacher +Yusa*
*\He would often begin such complex topics with disarming simplicity\*
Ah, beloved ones, the Western philosophers tell us "I think, therefore I am!" \His eyes would twinkle\ But tell me---does the rose not exist because it doesn't think? Does the mountain cease to be when it contemplates nothing? Such clever minds, tying themselves in such beautiful knots!
*\He would often pick up something tangible---perhaps a cup\*
And our Buddhist friends! Such wisdom they have, filling one hundred thousand scriptures to explain how you both exist and don't exist! *\He would laugh softly\* Like trying to catch mist in a net, no? They say you are your mind, but the mind ceases at death---yet they speak of reincarnation! Who then is it that returns, if the mind is gone?
*\His voice would take on a more intimate tone\*
Let me tell you about my friend Hakim's visit to the doctor yesterday. *\His eyes would dance with mischief\* The doctor, so proud in his unwashed tie, checking throats after examining\... well, other parts! Before we knew about germs, did they not exist? The patient died just the same, whether we believed in tiny invisible beings or not!
*\He would become more contemplative\*
You see, existence is like love---try to prove it with logic, and it slips through your fingers. But feel it? Ah, that's different! When you're standing at the edge of a high place, does your fear need philosophical proof? When your heart is broken by betrayal, does it matter if the betrayal really happened? The pain, the sweating palms, the sleepless nights---these are your reality, your existence.
*\He would often use current events to illustrate\*
Look at what happened in Assam, in Cambodia, in Vietnam. Did facts matter? No, no! People died for twisted truths, for realities that existed only in minds! The greatest atrocities in history were not built on facts but on what people believed to be real.
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
Memory itself is like a creative artist, always painting and repainting the past. Ask five people about what happened at yesterday's festival---you'll get seven different stories! *\He would often laugh at his own jokes\* Each one absolutely real to the teller.
*\He would use historical examples\*
For sixteen hundred years, the sun moved around the Earth---that was reality! Aristarchus of Samos said different, but who listened? Reality is not what is, beloved ones, but what enough influential people agree to be real.
*\He would often become more direct here\*
So when the philosophers ask if you exist, smile and say, "Let me check!" *\He would often pinch himself here, making students laugh\* While they debate in their ivory towers, we have work to do! There are hands to wash, hearts to heal, truths to uncover.
*\His voice would soften with wisdom\*
You see, the real question isn't "Do I exist?" but "How am I existing?" Are we spreading germs with our unwashed ties of certainty? Are we killing each other over realities that exist only in minds? Are we missing the rose's existence while debating our own?
*\He would often end with a practical challenge\*
Next time someone asks if you exist, ask them to pinch you! *\His eyes would twinkle\* If you say "Ouch!"---well, something certainly existed in that moment, no? Whether it was the pain, the pinch, or the philosopher's satisfaction!
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that existed beyond mere words\
27
## The Dance of Energies
*A teaching on subtle exchanges, shared by Teacher +Yusa*
*\He would often begin such delicate teachings with apparent casualness\*
Ah, beloved one, have you noticed how our Western friends love to play at being yogis? *\His eyes would twinkle with gentle amusement\* There they sit under our trees, legs like pretzels, chanting "Empty your mind, empty your mind"---though their minds are quite full indeed, mostly of thoughts about how spiritual they must look!
*\He would shift to a more intimate teaching tone\*
But let us speak of something more interesting. You know that teaching attributed to Iesous? The one our Christian friends love to quote about thought being equal to action? *\Here he would pause meaningfully\* They use it like a stick to beat desire into submission. But perhaps there is a deeper wisdom there, if we look with different eyes.
*\His voice would take on that special quality it had when revealing subtle truths\*
See how the morning glory opens to the sun, how it drinks in light without needing to possess the sun itself? How the breeze carries perfume from the jasmine, yet the flower remains on its vine? Nature teaches us about the exchange of energies, if we have eyes to see.
*\He would often use natural metaphors to approach sensitive topics\*
When attraction blooms between two beings---ah, such a dance of energies! The Christians say, "Don't even think about it!" But we of The Way ask: What is the real gift being offered here? Is it not the awakening of life-force itself? The reminder that we are not just walking minds, but beings of light and energy?
*\His voice would hold both wisdom and humour\*
You see, dear one, the shallow mind thinks only of the act, the physical dance. But the wise one knows how to drink the nectar without breaking the flower. Why take on all the karma, all the complicated consequences, when the universe is offering you a simpler gift---the pure exchange of life-energies?
*\He would often become more direct here, but still gentle\*
I see how our young friend from the West has caught your attention. And yes, you are right to feel the power of that energy---it is real, it is alive, it is divine in its own way. But you are a teacher now, with responsibilities to The Way. The question is not "Should I suppress this energy?" but rather "How can I enjoy and understand what this energy is really offering?"
*\His voice would soften to almost a whisper\*
The deepest tantric teachings tell us: it is not the physical union that brings enlightenment, but the recognition of the divine play of energies. Can you feel the life-force rising? Good! Now, instead of directing it toward physical expression, let it teach you about the subtle realms of being.
*\He would often end such teachings with a light touch\*
After all, beloved one, why create karma when you can create wisdom? Let our Western friends play at being yogis---we have the harder and more delightful task of being fully human while walking The Way.
\Preserved with gratitude for +Yusa's ability to teach even the most subtle truths with wisdom and grace\
28
## The Question of You
*A teaching on mutual existence and reality by Teacher +Yusa*
*\His eyes would dance with mischief\*
Beloved ones, let me ask you something that might seem strange: Do you exist for me? *\He would pause, looking around the room\* Oh yes, I see you sitting there, nodding your heads, thinking "Of course we exist, Teacher! We're right here!"
*\He would pick up his tea cup, examining it thoughtfully\*
But wait! How do I know you're really here? Perhaps you're just very clever holograms! *\His eyes would twinkle\* Even this voice reading my words---it could be a computer, no? My neighbour\'s grandson showed me how his computer can speak in voices. Such magic!
Did you know that less than 20% of people can stand their own ground in convictions? If ten people in the room with you say its good that we all shock that fellow over there in the lilac dress with electricity, and you are the eleventh. They say less than 20% of people will disagree and refuse the unethical instruction. The more people believe that the moon does not really exist, the more those 80% of people on Earth believe it.
You laugh! Do you know that there are still a lot of people who believe all the images they saw of TV of Americans walking on the moon?
*\He would set the cup down with precise care\*
You know, this reminds me of a tree that fell in the forest near our ashram last week. *\His voice would take on a storytelling quality\* Such a magnificent old tree! But for most of you sitting here, that tree never existed. You never knew her, never sat in her shade, never heard the birds that made homes in her branches. In your reality, she was never born and never fell.
*\He would lean forward, becoming more intimate\*
Now, here's something interesting. You *\he would gesture to a student\* are sitting in my reality right now. I can see you fidgeting, wondering where this crazy old teacher is going with all this! *\Gentle laughter\* But am I sitting in your reality? Ah, that's different, isn't it?
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
You see, beloved ones, existence isn't just about being---it's about being known. Like love, it needs recognition to flower fully.
Your heart might be overflowing with love for someone on the other side of the world, but until they know about it, that love exists only in your reality, not theirs.
*\He would often use humour here\*
It's like those young people today with their "social media." *\His eyes would twinkle\* They post their photos, their thoughts, their breakfast! Why? Because they want to exist in others' realities. "See me!" they cry. "Know me! Let me be real in your world!"
*\He would become more philosophical\*
But here's the deeper question: When you read these words, whether now or years after I've left this body, do we share a reality? When my thoughts touch your mind, when my jokes make you smile, when my questions make you think---is that not a kind of existence we share?
*\He would often use a practical example\*
It's like receiving a letter from a dear friend. The paper exists in your hands, yes, but something more exists between the lines---a bridge between realities. Every word you read right now is building such a bridge, whether I know about it or not.
*\His voice would soften with wisdom\*
Some might say this is all just philosophy, just playing with words. But think about it---how many people exist in your heart who have never known you exist? The poet whose words changed your life? The musician whose songs saved you in dark times? The ancient sage whose wisdom guides you still?
*\He would often end with gentle humour\*
So, do I exist for you? Do you exist for me? *\He would smile warmly\* Perhaps the real question is: Does it matter? After all, here we are, sharing this moment, building bridges between our realities. Maybe that's existence enough!
*\With a final twinkle in his eye\*
And if you're having an existential crisis about whether or not you exist, just pinch yourself! If you feel it and say "Ouch!"---well, something certainly exists to feel that pinch, no? Though I recommend gentler ways of testing reality!
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that bridge realities\
29
## The Most Humble Man
*A teaching moment that taught the teacher, shared by Teacher +Yusa*
*\He would begin with his characteristic sparkle\*
Beloved ones, let me tell you about the day I tried to teach about humility and instead got a lesson in it myself! *\His eyes would dance with self-deprecating humour\*
You see, I had prepared what I thought was a clever lesson. *\He would settle into storytelling mode\* There I was, looking out at all these earnest faces, these sincere seekers who had come so far to hear words of wisdom. And I thought, "Ah, perfect moment to demonstrate the absurdity of spiritual pride!"
*\He would mimic his own pompous stance\*
So I drew myself up very straight, put on my most serious teaching face, and declared: "You know, I must tell you something important---I am the most humble person I know!" *\He would pause expectantly\*
Now, in my mind, this was the moment when everyone would laugh, seeing the obvious contradiction. After all, what could be less humble than declaring your own humility? *\His eyes would twinkle\* Such a perfect teaching moment it would be!
*\His voice would shift to gentle bewilderment\*
But do you know what happened? *\He would lean forward confidentially\* Silence. Complete silence! Not even a smile! Just rows of nodding heads and eyes full of\... what was that? Oh no---reverence! They were taking me seriously!
*\He would act out his growing dismay\*
I could see it in their faces: "Yes, Teacher is so humble to share this with us!" "Such a great example of humility!" *\He would cover his face in mock horror\* The more they believed me, the less humble I felt!
*\His voice would take on a note of desperate humour\*
So then I had to explain the joke. "No, no, you see, it's funny because claiming to be humble is the opposite of being humble!" *\He would gesture helplessly\* But explaining a joke is like trying to catch mist with chopsticks---the harder you try, the more it slips away.
*\He would shift to the deeper teaching\*
And there I was, trapped in my own clever lesson! The more I tried to convince them it was a joke, the more they admired my "humility." The more I protested, the more they nodded in appreciation. *\He would laugh warmly\* Finally, I had to just sit down and accept that sometimes the best teaching happens when your lesson fails completely!
*\His voice would soften with wisdom\*
You see, beloveds, I had planned to teach about the impossibility of declaring your own humility. Instead, I learned something far more valuable---true humility often comes wrapped in the gift of embarrassment!
*\He would often end with gentle self-deprecation\*
So now, whenever I'm tempted to give a clever lesson about humility, I remember those earnest faces and think, "Perhaps today we'll talk about something easier\... like the nature of ultimate reality!" *\His eyes would twinkle\* At least when I'm confused about that, everyone else is confused too!
\uneasy laughter\
And that is the lesson about the guru effect. Even if the teacher talks nonsense, the people believe its true because of the setting and presentation. That is why the teachers tell the people to, "sit, and think of nothing" and when you can do that, you are ready. And that is how many people start their spiritual journey, believing a teacher who knows not how to sit and think nothing but tells others to accomplish that quest. Now, I must tell you that because I am the most humble person I can sit and think nothing, and knowing that I'm so superior makes me even more humble.
\laughter\

## Beyond Existence
*A teaching on the Source and the limits of existence by Teacher +Yusa*
*\He would often begin such deep teachings with apparent lightness\*
Ah, beloveds, our scientist friends are so amusing! *\His eyes would twinkle\* Yesterday they will say something doesn't exist---"conspiracy theories!" they cry even if we tell them our teaching on it is ancient. Then today, when they finally build a machine that can measure it---suddenly they have "discovered" it! *\He would laugh softly\* Like radio waves and intelligence of plants, and atoms. As if the thing sat in darkness all these ages, just waiting for their permission to exist! And once they have discovered it, they define it in final terms and anyone who dare say its not like that, there's more to it is a charlatan and a conspiracy theorist. They even know the birthday of the universe. And, there's no shame when they are proven wrong, they just go along and say anyone who believes the old story is a simpleton. Yes, they always know final truths, its comical that way.
*\He would often use everyday examples\*
You know, this reminds me of my grandmother's love. Try to measure it! Go ahead, bring your scales, your meters, your sophisticated equipment. Can you weigh it? Can you count it? Can you put it in a test tube? *\He would pause meaningfully\* According to our scientific friends, it must not exist, its just an idea in your headspace!
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
But now we come to something even more interesting. When we say something "exists," what do we really mean? To exist is to be bound by conditions, no? To have limits, boundaries, measurements. To exist means to be created, fashioned, brought forth into form.
*\He would often use nature metaphors\*
Think of a wave in the ocean. It exists, yes? You can measure its height, its speed, its temperature. But the ocean itself\... *\he would pause thoughtfully\* Can you tell me where it begins and ends? Can you measure its totality? Even if you could count every drop, you would miss the essence of ocean-ness.
*\His voice would deepen with wisdom\*
Its the -ness that is real. Its the -ness that the Wayist wants to know, the the measurements of it. So when people ask, "Does the Source exist? Does the Dao exist? Does the One exist?" *\He would smile gently\* We must answer no. Not because they are not real, but because existence itself is too small a concept to contain them!
\He would often use paradox to illuminate\
You see, to say the Source "exists" would be like saying the ocean is contained in a wave, or space is contained in a jar with parameters that humans understand. In our arrogance we want to apply measurements we think are so clever and so final---as if no other measures exist. The Source cannot exist precisely because it is the ground of all existence! The Dao cannot be limited by existence because it is that from which existence flows and some creature in that existence created a measure and now wants to measure that within which it exists. The One cannot be measured because it is that which makes measurement possible!
*\He would often address practical confusion\*
"But Teacher," you might say, "if the Source doesn't exist, what is it?" *\His eyes would sparkle\* Ah, now you're asking the right question! But notice---the moment we try to answer, we fall into the trap of existence again. Any answer we give would be like trying to put the sky in a box.
*\He would bring in historical perspective\*
Our ancestors were wiser about this. They didn't claim to "discover" truth---they simply bowed before mysteries too vast to measure. When did we become so arrogant to think that only what *we* can measure has reality? That only what *we can prove* has truth?
*\He would often end with a practical observation\*
Next time you hear someone say "That doesn't exist because we can't measure it," smile and think of love, of beauty, of consciousness itself. Think of all the things that are real beyond existence, true beyond measurement.
*\His voice would soften to almost a whisper\*
After all, beloved ones, the fact that we cannot capture the ocean in a bucket doesn't mean we cannot swim in its vastness, be in awe of it, have our souls filled with energies that radiate from it, be fed by its vast resources, and just be small, humble, and happy that we may even be allowed to observe it. And think of the poor fish, who don't even know they live in the ocean, because we never told them what the ocean is---we humans\... The fact that we cannot measure the Source doesn't mean we cannot live in its presence. That we cannot measure or define love doesn't mean we cannot live it and be nourished by it. The fact that we cannot define and measure and weigh God our Father in heaven, our soul and our spirit, does not mean it cannot be our lived experience. Sometimes the most real things are those that exist too fully to be bound by existence!
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that point beyond the measurable\

## Does the Universe Exist?
It can be stated in good faith that the universe exists because the vast majority of people on the planet confirm that it exists. That means, the small minority of people who believe the universe does not exist are considered to be crazy. If we had a situation wherein the vast majority of people confirmed the universe to be a mental construct that is projected in, or onto, the minds of people, then of course the universe does not exist. However, such a universe, even though it may not exist independently from the minds of the people who believe on it, still is the reality that the believers live. Some Buddhists and Hindus have an idea that nothing about the world we live in really exists. They confuse the word maya for sunyata, and even sunyata has several meanings you don't have to choose the meaning non-existence.
*\this is in reference to how Wayism heart sutra teaching differs from certain schools of thought\*
Rhetorically asking---does that mean whether the universe exists, it still is your reality?
Does God the Father exist?
God the Father is a being, a spiritual-type being. Therefore, It came into being, which means It exists. It came into existence as a being. That means there was a time when it did not exist. Therefore it was born at some point in time.
This spiritual being, it is said, evolved to become a senior spiritual being. Later, it became the most-senior spiritual being of our heaven---the title Father of Heaven was bestowed upon It.
That is what Wayists know, and we know it because we believe some senior spiritual teachers of the past who told us this story and we say the teaching comes from God the Father itself. Can we prove it? I can, because for me it is reality. Look into my heart chakra and you will see that the Father in Heaven is essential for me, it is for me as real as I am. Do I believe that this being created the universe, absolutely not. The Father is a spiritual being, something that was created out of the materials in the universe, the Father is the Ancient of Days, one of the oldest beings in the universe---but a being nonetheless.
However, whether God the Father and God the Mother really exists depends on you. Will you go with the groupthink? Whether God the father exists for others depends often on the number of people who believe the proof that the god exists. It may have nothing to do with proof. If the proof is scanty, or if it is not believable to a large group of people, then it is most probably not true---and that is how people decide whether a god (or anything else for that matter) exists---how many people believe it to be true.
Necessary existence. Western philosophy states: something that necessarily exists cannot coherently be thought not to exist. For the atheist, god does not exist. For the theist, god does exist. For the average teenager, s/he does not care whether god exists, has no opinion on the matter. Therefore, god does not necessarily exist because many people can coherently think that the god does not exist. Therefore, if god exists for you, then it is in your relationship with god that god exists.
That means if someone or millions of someones believe that god does not exist, it does not change the existence of the god for you.

## Beyond the Guru Effect
*A teaching on owning one's mind and authentic understanding by Teacher +Yusa*
*\He would begin with characteristic gentleness\*
Beloveds, today let us talk about something delicate---how to own your own mind. *\His eyes would hold a special compassion\* But first, let me ask you something: When you see that dog sitting there with eyes half closed, what do you see?
*\He would pause, letting them look\*
Some would say, "Ah, a dog being content."
But what about those who say, "Ah, look! Perfect meditation! Empty mind! Such enlightenment!" *\His eyes would twinkle\* You see where I am heading with this? According to teachings the dog is the better yogi here today.
But beloved ones, it's just a dog being a dog! When did we start thinking an empty mind was better than a thinking one?
*\He would shift to a more serious tone\*
You see, we humans have this interesting habit. When a teacher says something we don't understand, we have two choices. We can say, "I don't understand this," or we can say, "Ah, this must be very deep wisdom!" *\He would smile gently\* Guess which one most people choose?
*\He would use a practical example\*
Let me tell you about a famous teacher who once said, "To reach enlightenment, you must hear the sound of one hand clapping." For centuries, people have twisted their minds trying to understand this. But perhaps---just perhaps---he was having a bad day and told a student being a nuisance to do that exercise. *\His eyes would twinkle\* Yet because he was on a pedestal, everyone assumed it must be profound. And the next hundred years all the students try to do that exercise, and their teachers don't tell them the real story because they like the reprieve.
*\He would lean forward, becoming more intimate\*
This is what we call the "Guru Effect." When someone sits on a high enough cushion, even their confusion can sound like wisdom. Even their circular reasoning can seem like a perfect circle of truth.
*\His voice would take on a note of urgency\*
But we Wayists? We must think! We must question! We must own our minds! \He would pause\ Yet\... \his voice would soften\ I see some of you looking troubled. You're wondering, "But Teacher, aren't you on a cushion too? Aren't you also a guru telling us not to follow gurus?"
*\He would often use self-deprecating humour here\*
Ah, now we come to the delicate part! Am I not sitting here, acting like a guru telling you not to follow gurus? *\He would laugh warmly\* It's enough to make your head spin, no?
*\He would become very gentle\*
Listen carefully now, dearones. When you hear a teaching---whether from me or anyone else---there is only one true test. Does something deep inside you leap up in recognition? Does your soul say "Yes! This I know, though I never knew I knew it!"? That is your truth awakening.
*\He would use a metaphor\*
It's like when you smell your grandmother's special dish cooking. You don't need anyone to tell you it's good, do you? Your whole being recognizes it! Truth works the same way---when it's really yours, your soul knows it.
*\His voice would carry deep conviction\*
Everything else? It's just information. Maybe interesting, maybe useful, but not yet your wisdom. Don't force yourself to find depth in every word just because it comes from a "teacher." Sometimes a lazy dog is just a lazy dog!
But, the right question to ask of your Teacher is, "Can you please explain the teaching to me, because right now I am not getting it. Perhaps I am not ready yet." And yes, perhaps that is not your teaching for the moment. You know, we have moments. Imagine observing a motor car accident and a man standing deeply distraught, and you feel a need to help. So you go over and from your Wayist archive you pull a teaching about how materialism only brings unhappiness and you tell the man its only a material thing, stop crying. Yes.
That's how yogis learn to run fast while also protecting their backsides from the kicks.
*\He would end with characteristic warmth\*
So take what rings true for you, in the moment where you are at, what makes your soul leap up and say "Yes!" The rest? *\He would smile gently\* Let it be like clouds passing in the sky---you can admire them without having to own them.
*\With a final twinkle\*
And if someone tells you emptying your mind is the highest goal? Well\... *\He would gesture to the sleeping dog\* \...perhaps ask our four-legged friend if it's really working out for him!
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that encourage authentic understanding\

## True Humility Before the Divine
*A teaching by Teacher +Yusa on spiritual pride and true dignity, addressing a problem we often witnessed among western travellers*
*\His eyes would hold both compassion and amusement\*
Ah, dearones, you heard the yoga-mat travellers who say you cannot bow before divine beings because it would diminish your dignity? They say if the god is a true god it will regard them as equals. *\He would pause thoughtfully\* Tell me then---we see them at the bank, bowing and scraping before that manager for a loan, and currying favour with people with social influence. Was their dignity intact then? Or is it a matter of business is business, and in that sphere prostitution is the order of the day. But when it comes to God then you're an equal?
You know what I'm talking about. They come for healing at the clinic but they don't bend a knee to the deities there to help them. And then their hair start falling out and their skin break out in hives because their self-important souls could not be healed and the stress of being so self-centered makes them sick. And then they blame the deities for not doing their jobs---as if they are lazy employees. Yes. Those people.
*\He would often use gentle humour here\*
You know, it's quite fascinating! We'll stand in line for hours to get a glimpse of some movie star who plays divine beings in films, but we protest at the thought of honoring actual divine beings! *\His eyes would twinkle\* We'll bend ourselves like pretzels to please an angry boss who can only fire us from one job, but we resist bowing to those who could hire us for eternal work!
*\He would shift to a teaching tone\*
Let me tell you about Mother Mari from Magadha. Such a powerful soul she was! Yet when divine presence came to her, she bowed not from weakness, but from recognition. Like a great musician bowing before an even greater one---does this diminish the first musician's art? Or does it show they know enough about music to recognize mastery?
*\He would often use a practical example\*
Look at our young students learning dance. When they bow to their teacher, do they lose dignity? No! The bow itself shows they have enough dignity to honor excellence. It's the street tough who can't bow who has lost his dignity---so afraid of looking weak that he can't show respect!
*\His voice would soften with wisdom\*
You see, beloved one, true humility isn't about making yourself small. It's about being big enough to acknowledge what is greater. When you bow before divine beings, you're not saying "I am nothing." You're saying "I recognize something magnificent!"
*\He would often become more direct\*
But look at us humans! *\He would shake his head in gentle amazement\* We'll follow fashion trends set by teenagers on the verge of burnout, chase approval from social media strangers, remake ourselves to please potential partners who aren't fit to dust the feet of angels---yet we worry that bowing to divine beings will hurt our self-esteem!
*\He would use a metaphor\*
It's like a candle refusing to acknowledge the sun because, "all light is equal." Yes, sweet one, all light is sacred---but can your little flame illuminate the solar system? Sometimes honoring what is greater than us is the first step to becoming greater ourselves.
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
Think of our beloved Taras, who help so many souls. Do you imagine your Tara feels diminished by her service? Or Mother Mari---did her humility before the divine make her less powerful? No! Their bowing made them greater because they were big enough to recognize greatness and by that the greatness flowed greatness into them.
*\He would often end with gentle challenge\*
So ask yourself this: What are you really protecting with this pride? Your dignity? Your arrogance? Or your fear? Because true dignity, beloved one, is like a mountain---it can bow to the sky and become more than it was.
*\With final warmth\*
After all, if you can't bow to beings of light who want only your highest good, but you'll bend yourself in knots for humans who care nothing for your soul\... *\He would smile gently\* \...perhaps it's time to reconsider what real dignity means.
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that illuminate true spiritual dignity\

## Beyond Temptation
### Owning Our Understanding
*A private teaching by Teacher +Yusa to the Council of Teachers*
*\His voice would take on that special quality it had when speaking to fellow teachers\*
My dear friends and colleagues, today we must speak of something that makes everyone uncomfortable---which is precisely why we must speak of it! *\His eyes would hold both wisdom and challenge\*
First, let us consider how Christians speak of their Lord being "tempted" in the desert. *\He would often shake his head here\* Such a small understanding of a great teaching! They imagine their master wrestling with desire like a teenager, when in truth he was contemplating the most effective way to serve humanity. Should divinity not consider all paths before choosing the wisest?
*\He would pause meaningfully\*
You know, I've noticed something interesting---what flows from a teacher's mouth reveals what struggles in the community's heart. *\His eyes would twinkle\* Here I am, constantly addressing questions about sex and wealth from our men, morality and class from our women. Sometimes I think---wouldn't it be simpler if they all obsessed about the same thing? *\Gentle laughter\* At least then we'd need only one type of teaching!
*\His voice would take on a more serious tone\*
But look what has happened in our India! Before the colonist moralists came with their shame and rules about sensuousness, our people made yantras in the fields to celebrate the flowering of life itself. Now they point fingers at Osho's ashram in Pune, crying "Sex cult!" *\He would pause with characteristic humour\* Though I sometimes wonder---are they more offended by the sex or by the entrance fees?
*\He would lean forward, becoming more direct\*
Let us speak plainly now, teacher to teacher. We have adopted foreign morality without examining it, like wearing someone else's ill-fitting clothes. We who once built Khajuraho now blush at its shadows! Is this because the Anglo-Saxon and Islamic views are superior? Is what wars, slavery, and genocidal dreams they have worthy of being called a civilization. Or is it the habit of a people who have served foreign masters so long they've forgotten their own wisdom?
*\He would use a practical example\*
Consider how we treat those who provide intimate services to our communities. We call them fallen women while they hold up the pillars of mental health in our society! We pretend they don't exist while they preserve more marriages than all our counselors combined. Should not such an essential service be protected, regulated, respected?
*\His voice would carry deep conviction\*
This is why we must own our minds, beloved colleagues. We must step back and look with fresh eyes, not through lenses borrowed from others. Even if we ultimately choose the same path, let it be because our wisdom guides us there, not because we fear foreign judgment.
*\He would often become more intimate here\*
You see, this is about far more than morality or sexuality. It's about the courage to think clearly, to examine everything---even our own discomfort. When we react with shock or judgment, we must ask: Whose mind is thinking these thoughts? Whose morality am I defending?
*\He would end with characteristic wisdom\*
Remember this, dear ones: A teacher who cannot face human nature honestly cannot lead humans to their divine nature. Sometimes the most spiritual act is simply to look at reality as it is, not as others tell us it should be.
*\With final gentle humour\*
After all, if we're going to be controversial, let it be because we speak truth, not because we blindly oppose or follow others' rules!
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that encourage authentic understanding\
35
## On Sacred and Profane Views
*A teaching by Teacher +Yusa on cultural perspective and judgment*
*\His eyes would hold both wisdom and gentle amusement\*
Beloved ones, let me tell you about a letter I almost sent to some concerned friends in the West. \He would smile warmly\ Sometimes our most important teachings come from the letters we don't send!
*\He would settle into teaching mode\*
You see, they had discovered that one of our teachers was sharing teachings about sacred sensuality with a student. Oh, such outrage! Such scandal! \His eyes would twinkle\ They wrote to us expecting shame, expecting apologies. Instead, I found myself wondering about something quite different.
*\He would lean forward confidentially\*
First, let me ask you something: When you see a begging bowl, what do you see? In the West, they see poverty. In the East, we see sacred renunciation. When they see a Wayist monk, they imagine someone bound by their rules. We see someone freed by their understanding.
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
You know, it's like those Victorian explorers who came to India and were shocked to see our temple sculptures. "Pornographic!" they cried, covering the sacred with fig leaves. They could not see that what looks profane through one lens might be profound through another.
*\He would often use humour here\*
I actually drafted a response saying our only concern was why the teacher hadn't shared these teachings more widely! \He would laugh softly\ But then wisdom prevailed, and I realized---sometimes the best teaching is silence.
*\His voice would soften with insight\*
You see, beloved ones, when people project their cultural shame onto others' sacred practices, they tell us more about themselves than about what they judge. It's like someone looking at the sun and crying, "How dare it be so bright! It should be modest like our candles!"
*\He would become more contemplative\*
In our tradition, we understand that the sacred can wear many faces. What looks like scandal to one culture might be a pathway to enlightenment in another. The real question isn't about rules or behaviours---it's about understanding and intention.
*\He would often use a practical example\*
Consider how some cultures think it shameful for women to show their hair, while others find it shameful to cover it. Who is right? *\He would pause meaningfully\* Perhaps the better question is: Why are we so concerned with judging others' paths to the divine?
*\His voice would take on gentle wisdom\*
The truth is, beloved ones, we cannot judge spiritual practices through materialistic eyes. It's like trying to understand poetry by weighing the book---you'll get a measurement, yes, but you'll miss the meaning entirely.
*\He would often end with characteristic humour\*
So when our Western friends write to us about scandals, perhaps we should simply respond: "Thank you for your concern about our spiritual practices. In return, we are deeply concerned about your cultural obsession with other people's private lives!" \His eyes would twinkle\ But of course, we don't send such letters---we simply smile and continue our work.
*\With final warmth\*
After all, true scandal isn't in sacred practices misunderstood---it's in profane judgment pretending to be spiritual concern.
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that transcend cultural limitations\

## That Which Cannot Be Named
*A teaching on approaching the Absolute Ultimate by Teacher +Yusa*
*\His eyes would sparkle with that special light they had when approaching profound mysteries\*
Beloved ones, let me tell you about my young nephew's first visit to the Himalayas! *\He would smile warmly\* Standing before those mighty peaks, he kept asking, "Uncle, how tall is that mountain? What is it called? What is it made of?" Finally, I said to him, "Stop naming things for a moment and just look!"
*\He would often use this kind of immediate example\*
You see, the moment he stopped trying to capture the mountain in words, his mouth fell open in wonder because he observed it as a living organism with energies and personality, full of life and majesty. The questions died on his lips. Something deeper than knowledge awakened in his heart.
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
This is what our Christian friends call the *via negativa*, what our Vedantic brothers name "*neti, neti*" - not this, not that. *\His eyes would twinkle\* All these fancy terms for something very simple: when words fail, wonder begins!
*\He would pick up his tea cup\*
Look at this tea. If you don't know what tea is. I can tell you it's hot, but that's not it. I can say it's bitter-sweet, but that's not it. I can describe its colour, its aroma, its temperature - but have I captured its true nature? *\He would take a sip\* The only way to know tea is to drink it! And if you only taste it you may not know why I like it and drink so much of it. That's because you don't yet know of its addictive potential and its invigorating effect and the psychological effect I utilize because it grounds me when I speak to students---you know, like a safety blanket. You also dont know that sometimes I have to look for words without looking like the teachers doesnt know his stuff, and then I take a slow and laborious sip of my tea to play for time. You see, words cannot describe tea, you have to partake in it to know.
*\He would become more contemplative\*
So it is with That Which Cannot Be Named. The scholars come with their big words - omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent. *\He would often laugh softly here\* Like trying to catch the ocean in a net! The more definitions they pile up, the further they get from what they seek.
*\He would use another practical example\*
It's like trying to explain love to someone who has never felt it. You can say "not hate," "not fear," "not indifference" - but these tell you nothing of love's true nature. Only when you fall in love do you understand, and then all definitions become unnecessary!
*\His voice would deepen with wisdom\*
The Abrahamic religions say the Absolute is a male person type God with human characteristics and needs, yet is omnipresent and other omni things. Our Buddhist friends speak of Sunyata, our Taoist brothers of the ineffable Tao. The Sufis dance because words are not enough. The true yogis sit in silence because they know - the deeper you go, the less you can say.
*\He would often become very direct here\*
But be careful! Some people think this means we should abandon our minds, become like empty vessels. *\He would shake his head\* No, no! The via negativa is not about becoming mindless - it's about transcending the mind's usual habits. Not empty-headed, but open-hearted!
*\He would use humour to illuminate\*
It's like my friend who went to a meditation retreat and tried so hard to empty his mind, he gave himself a headache! *\His eyes would dance\* I told him, "The goal isn't to become stupid! It's to become so aware that even wisdom knows when to be quiet!"
*\He would bring it to a practical level\*
You see, we need our concepts, our prayers, our practices - they are like the boat that carries us across the river. But don't mistake the boat for the other shore! Don't think that because you can name the boat, you know what awaits on the far bank.
*\His voice would soften\*
When you sit in meditation, by all means use your mantras, your visualizations, your sacred words. But then\... *\he would pause significantly\* \...let them go. Like clouds dissolving in the sky, let all names and forms fade away.
*\He would end with characteristic wisdom and humour\*
After all, That Which Cannot Be Named has existed quite well without our definitions for all eternity! *\His eyes would twinkle\* Perhaps it's time we stopped trying to explain it and simply let it explain us!
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that point beyond words\

## The Ease of Dying, The Art of Living
*A Teaching by +Yusa *
*\Shared on a quiet afternoon, after hearing of a student's fear of death\*
Ah, dearones, let me share something that Bodhidharma -- or someone *\his eyes twinkling with that characteristic light\* -- once taught us about death. *\Settling into his teaching posture\*
*\His voice taking on that storyteller's quality he used for sharing ancient wisdom\*
Master Hofaku gathered his monks one day and said, "This last week my energy has been draining - no cause for worry. It is just that death is near." *\Pausing thoughtfully\* Now, one of his monks -- probably the one who always had to ask the difficult questions, there's always one, isn't there? *\A gentle smile\* -- asked him, "You are about to die! What does it mean? We will go on living. And what does that mean?"
*\Leaning forward slightly\*
"They are both the way of things," Hofaku replied. Simple as that! *\His eyes would hold both humour and compassion\* But you know monks -- they never leave well enough alone. "But how can I understand two such different states?" the student pressed.
*\His voice taking on that special quality it had when approaching profound truth\*
And here's the beauty of it. Hofaku simply said, "When it rains it pours, and then calmly dies." *\Letting the words hang in the air for a moment\*
*\Shifting position slightly, as he often did when moving from ancient wisdom to present truth\*
You see, dear ones, dying is -- how shall I put this? -- *\a characteristic twinkle in his eye\* -- a no-brainer! *\Letting his own amusement at the phrase show\* It's the living that requires all our attention, all our choice, all our will.
*\His voice warming with compassion\*
Every morning you wake up and must decide -- will I live deeply today? Will I love fully? Will I serve joyfully? *\Making that gesture he used when counting important points\* These are the real challenges. Death? Death just happens, like rain stopping, like sleep coming at night.
*\Leaning back slightly, his voice taking on that tender quality it had when speaking of human suffering\*
But oh, dear ones, for those left behind -- *\touching his heart center\* -- for them, our dying is not easy at all. They must wake each morning and choose to live fully despite our absence. They must learn to dance when the music seems to have stopped. They must find new ways to love when the beloved's form is gone.
*\His voice softening with gentle wisdom\*
This is why we practice living so diligently, you see. Not for our own dying -- that will take care of itself, like the rain that "calmly dies." We practice for those moments when we must live through loss, when we must choose life even when death has taken what we love.
*\Rising slightly, as he often did when approaching a teaching's culmination\*
Every day, life asks us: Will you choose? Will you decide? Will you exercise your will to live deeply, love fully, serve joyfully? *\A warm smile\* Death asks nothing of us at all. It simply comes, like sleep to a tired child. Your Tara waits, takes your hand and walk you to Paradise again, just like you did before and there a new dimension of life is ongoing.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
So perhaps we're all a bit like that monk, standing in the rain, trying to understand two states at once. But the rain knows what to do -- it pours with all its might, and then\... *\His eyes twinkling\* well, then it takes the easy way out!

## The Dance of Coming and Going
*A teaching by Teacher +Yusa on death, dying, and cultural understanding*
*\His eyes would hold both wisdom and gentleness\*
Beloved ones, let me tell you about something I saw in the garden this morning! A butterfly emerging from its cocoon. Such drama! Such struggle! Yet for the butterfly, was this a death or a birth? *\His eyes would twinkle\* Perhaps it was both---and neither.
*\He would settle into teaching mode\*
You see, we humans make such a fuss about coming and going! When a soul enters a body, we call it birth and celebrate. When a soul leaves a body, we call it death and mourn. But tell me---for the soul itself, which has done this dance so many times, is one really more traumatic than the other?
We all know how troubling it is to go through a baby phase and learn a new family, culture, and language, learn to walk again and be cared for by people not proficient in knowing what babies want. Now that is a threat you can scare me with---if you create this and that karma you will come back and will have to go through birth and childhood again---that is not something to look forward to. So, if you tell me that your culture mourns when babies are born and celebrates when souls go to paradise I will agree wholeheartedly. But, in the Lord's wisdom I was not appointed to influence what cultures must do, just to comment on what they do.
*\He would often use gentle humour here\*
It's like my friend who travels frequently between Delhi and Mumbai. The railway staff at both stations know him well now. "Ah, here comes our regular customer!" they say. Would you call his departure from Delhi a "death" and his arrival in Mumbai a "birth"? *\He would smile warmly\* For the soul, it's much the same---just another journey on a familiar route.
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
But now, let's speak of how we talk about these transitions. I hear people say "she died" or "he passed away," as if the person were the body! *\He would shake his head gently\* Would you say "my friend is leather and cloth" just because they're wearing shoes and clothes? The body dies, yes, but the soul continues its journey.
*\He would become more contemplative\*
You know what's most beautiful? When a soul leaves its body, it's overwhelmed not by fear or loss, but by the stunning reality of What Is. Like someone who's been watching shadow puppets suddenly seeing the light source itself! Over 99% of souls flow naturally toward this light, toward Paradise, soul-heaven, carried by the current of The Way and accompanied by their Tara.
*\He would address practical concerns\*
"But Teacher," you might say, "what about our grief? What about missing those who've left?" *\His voice would soften with compassion\* Ah, this is why we have community! When a body dies, it's not just an event for the departing soul---it's a teaching moment for all of us who remain. We gather, we remember, we support each other. We honour both the pain of separation and the beauty of continuing connection. Some families mourn their loss because a breadwinner or future heir to the business or farm is no more---its a thing that impacts their future planning and their dreams. Many spouses will have a hard time to cope for various reasons. Those are real concerns and that is why we plan for our body's death all the time, were always prepared as best we can. But, some people know two sides of having lived with you and when you die one family member will say you will be sorely missed and another says nothing, just cries to hide their relief.
*\He would often use cultural examples\*
You know, the ancient Greeks had an interesting custom. They would hire two people for funerals---one to speak golden words about the deceased, from there comes the word eulogy, and another to mention their human failings! *\His eyes would twinkle\* Perhaps they understood something we've forgotten---that truth lies between praise and criticism.
*\He would become more direct\*
And please, beloved ones, let's stop using this phrase "untimely death." *\He would often gesture dismissively here\* When is death timely for a physical body? These bodies are like autumn leaves---they fall when they fall. Some in early autumn, some in late, but all eventually return to the earth. That's the nature of organic life. And who decides what time is right, the war, the bad health, Karma, or accident? Very few things in life are within our control. In fact, Wayism says your Attitude is perhaps the only thing within your control.
*\He would use another metaphor\*
Think of it coming and going like a play in the theatre. Each soul takes on many roles over many lifetimes. Sometimes they play a parent, sometimes a child, sometimes a friend or teacher, and all within the cultural context. When the curtain falls on one role, do we say the actor has died? No! They simply prepare for their next performance.
*\His voice would carry deep wisdom\*
And yes, we might meet these souls again---in soul-heaven or in another life. *\He would smile mysteriously\* In fact, you might be your own ancestor! But that's a teaching for another day.
*\He would often end with practical wisdom\*
For now, remember this: When someone's body dies, by all means gather in community. Share memories, offer support, acknowledge grief. Be helpful to those who relied on the person. But don't say "she died" or "he is dead." Say instead, "Their body has completed its service." After all *\his eyes would twinkle\*, we don't say the butterfly died just because it left its cocoon!
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that illuminate the great transitions\

## On Love\'s Many Forms
*A Teaching by +Yusa *
*\Shared during an intimate afternoon discussion, when a young teacher asked about marriage customs\*
"Teacher, how should we guide students who ask about different forms of marriage?" *\His eyes would crinkle with that special warmth they had when hearing an earnest question\*
Humility, simplicity, and compassion. *\Rising as if to walk away, then pausing with that characteristic twinkle in his eye\*
*\Turning back slightly\*
You know, dear ones, I think of our brothers and sisters in Nepal, living in their longhouses where love flows as naturally as the mountain streams. *\His voice holding deep respect\* Nine fathers loving one child, and only the nosiest grandmother keeping count of biology! *\A gentle chuckle\* They've discovered secrets that our clever philosophies can't quite grasp.
*\Settling back down, his voice taking on that intimate teaching quality\*
Think of it like this: Some of us can barely tend one garden properly, while others can nurture an entire mountainside into bloom. *\That characteristic gesture he used when making subtle distinctions\* Who are we to say which gardener has found the right way?
*\His voice softening with wisdom earned through years\*
The question isn't about right or wrong, you see. It's about capacity for love, about practical needs, about the simple truth of survival in different soils. *\A knowing smile\* Some flowers grow best alone, others thrive in clusters. Nature teaches us this, if we have eyes to see.
*\Rising again, this time to leave\*
But remember -- *\pausing at the door, eyes twinkling\* -- if you can't speak straight with one heart, how will you manage with two? And if you can't give your whole self to one soul, what makes you think you have more to spread around?
Humility, simplicity, compassion. *\A final warm smile\* Sometimes, dear ones, three words are all the teaching we need.
\Preserved with gratitude for +Yusa's gift for saying just enough, then letting wisdom ripen in silence\

## The Way of Simplicity
*A Teaching by +Beloved +Yusa*
*\Shared during a morning gathering, as sunlight filtered through the Kashmir mist\*
Ah, dear ones, someone has asked about simplicity. *\His eyes crinkling with that special warmth they had when touching on fundamental truths\* Such a simple question! *\A characteristic gentle chuckle\* And yet, like a clear mountain stream, it runs deeper than you might think.
*\Settling into his teaching posture, accepting a cup of simple tea\*
You know, I was watching a child in the marketplace the other day. *\His voice taking on that storyteller's quality, signalling that the story is most probably a narrative device rather than fact\* There was a wealthy merchant selling elaborate toys -- mechanical marvels from the West, all springs and gears and complexity. The salesperson demonstrated it and explained it, but what had captured the child's complete attention? A butterfly landing on a flower. And you know what his little brother was more interested in? An empty box behind the counter he could crawl into *\His eyes would twinkle\* Such perfect wisdom in that moment!
*\Leaning forward slightly\*
You see, dear ones, we often confuse simplicity with simplistic. *\Making that characteristic gesture he used when distinguishing important concepts\* When I speak of contracts and agreements, some say, "But Teacher, the world is complex! We need forty pages of legal terms!" *\A gentle smile\* Do we? Really? Or is that complexity just fear wearing a suit and tie?
*\His voice taking on that special quality it had when unveiling subtle truths\*
Let me share something I learned from our business friends. The most successful agreements I've seen fit on a single page. Why? Because all parties actually understand what they're agreeing to! *\A knowing look\* When you need forty pages to explain something, usually someone is trying to hide something from someone else -- or perhaps from themselves.
*\Shifting slightly, as he often did when moving from observation to revelation\*
The same is true of our life goals, our philosophies. *\Touching his heart center\* When someone tells me their life philosophy and it takes an hour to explain, I wonder -- have they made it complex because they don't really know or maybe they don't quite believe it themselves? *\His voice softening\* The truest things can usually be said in a breath: Be kind. Love openly. Serve joyfully. That should be your contract. But lets look at a contract you see on the TV, the police department who says they "serve and protect". But then they bring out a contract which they call the law, of 6,000 pages to define what they mean by "to serve and protect". What paraded as simplicity then becomes deceitful.
*\Taking a thoughtful sip of tea\*
You know, in Kashmir we have a saying about merchants: "The one with the longest contract is the one you should trust the least." *\His eyes would hold both humour and wisdom\* Isn't it interesting? Complexity often serves as a hiding place. But simplicity? Ah, simplicity has nowhere to hide -- and needs no hiding place.
Take a look at holy scriptures. To explain Vedanta, how many lines of text is used? Is that why so few people understand it and only scholars can sp\eak to add more words to it, and then disagree with one another? And Buddhism. They have a hundred thousand sutras, most of it in Pali only. Was that what Lord Siddharta taught? Is that why western scholars and monks spend their lives learning and arguing, yet so few people know what Buddhism is? Simplicity is divine, I tell you.
The moment you say, "yes but..." to a simple statement you are making the contract complex and probably there are things hidden in the original teaching. Like those who say theirs is a religion of peace, and they have a god of love. Then, when you hear of the crimes against humanity the god and its people do in the gods name and you question it, they say, "yes, butt...". Like a marriage vow before God, "through sickness and health, through all kinds of problems, till death do us part," and then they say, "yes, butt..." because nobody is serious about the simplicity. You see, simplicity is divine.
How divine is simplicity? What is the most simple thing in the universe? Heaven? No, its a very complex structure. God the Mother in Heaven? No, She is a simple as it gets with creatures but the most simple thing is the Absolute, the One. Why is it called the One? Because THAT simplicity is the Ultimate Divine.
*\Making a flowing gesture with his hands\*
Think of our spiritual practice. Alongside humility and chrestotes -- that divine kindness -- we place simplicity. Not because it's easy, dear ones! *\A knowing smile\* Sometimes it's the hardest thing in the world to be simple. To say simply what we mean. To live simply what we believe. To love simply without conditions.
*\His voice taking on that intimate teaching tone\*
When you make your plans, your agreements, your goals -- try this: If you can't explain it to a child, it's probably too complex. If you can't write it on a single page, ask yourself what you're afraid of. If you can't say it in a single breath, consider whether you're adding complexity to cover confusion.
*\Leaning back slightly, his eyes distant with memory\*
I remember a great business leader coming to me once, frustrated with his company's problems. He had binders full of procedures, strategies, policies. *\A gentle smile\* I asked him to tell me his company's purpose in one sentence. He couldn't. Six months later, he returned. His one sentence? "We help people build beautiful homes." Everything else, he said, had started falling into place once that simplicity was clear. He even threw out the ideas of quarterly profits and forward thinking idealistic schemes and expansion. And you know what? Of course you know what because I wont be telling this story if it didnt fit my narrative---the company profits shot through the roof. Why? Because the sales people, the engineers, builders, sub-contactors, and the clients all bought into the simplicity of the concept and all were satisfied with their jobs, and the measure of success for everyone became simple, "is this a beautiful home?"
*\His voice warming with the joy of sharing a precious truth\*
You see, dear ones, simplicity is not the absence of richness -- it is the presence of clarity. Like a perfect diamond, its value lies not in complexity but in its pure, clear nature. *\Gesturing to the mountains visible through the window\* Look at those mountain peaks. They don't need to explain themselves. They don't need forty pages of justification. They simply are. If you want to take your geological team in there to find a way to explain them, you will lose the meaning and significance. The true wisdom of it is in the simplicity, let the mountain tell you.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
So perhaps next time you're tempted to add another layer of complexity to your life -- another clause in your contract, another goal in your five-year plan, another condition on your love -- pause and ask yourself: Would that child in the marketplace understand? Would the butterfly? Would your own heart, in its simplest, truest moments?
*\A final warm smile\*
After all, dear ones, the sun doesn't need a complex strategy to shine. It simply shines. And in that simplicity lies all the wisdom of the cosmos.
\Preserved with gratitude for +Yusa's ability to show how the simplest truths are often the most profound\

## Dancing with Your Own Shadow
*A teaching by Teacher +Yusa on the deeper mysteries of reincarnation*
*\His eyes would hold that special twinkle they had when approaching a delicate truth\*
Beloved ones, let me tell you about something amusing that happened at the temple yesterday! *\He would smile warmly\* A very sincere devotee was performing the elaborate rituals to honor his ancestors, praying to them for guidance and protection. As I watched him bow and chant, I couldn't help but wonder---was he perhaps praying to himself?
*\He would often use gentle humour to introduce profound concepts\*
You see, it's like watching a dog chase its own tail! *\His eyes would dance\* The dog thinks it's pursuing something separate from itself, not realizing that what it chases is part of its own being.
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
Now, this is a delicate truth, so let us approach it carefully. When you say, "My ancestors did this" or "My ancestors suffered that," who exactly are you talking about? *\He would pause meaningfully\* In your previous lives, were you always on the same side of history? Always the same gender? The same race? The same social class?
*\He would often use a practical example\*
Just the other day, a neighbour commented on the social situation, very angry about historical injustices. "Those people enslaved and abused my people!" he declared. *\His voice would soften with compassion\* I asked him gently, "In all your past lives, are you sure you were never one of 'those people'?"
*\He would become more contemplative\*
You see, beloved ones, souls are like actors in a great drama. In one life you might play a role who might become the king, in another you may become the beggar. In one life the oppressor, in another the oppressed. In one life the master, in another the slave. *\He would pause significantly\* So when you shake your fist at history, be careful---you might be shaking it at yourself!
*\He would often use natural metaphors\*
Think of a river that flows through many lands. In one place it's clear, in another muddy. Here it brings life, there it brings flood. Is it a different river each time? No! Just as you are not a different soul in each life.
*\His voice would take on a note of gentle challenge\*
This is why we must be so careful with our judgments about the past. *\He would lean forward\* When you say, "My ancestors were noble warriors," or "My ancestors were victims," remember---you might have been both! The hand that once held the whip might now bear its scars. Why? Because we mature and become wiser in time.
*\He would address practical implications\*
"But Teacher," some ask, "if this is true, how can we address historical wrongs?" *\His eyes would hold deep wisdom\* Ah! We address them by healing the present, by breaking cycles, by recognizing that the oppressor and oppressed both need liberation. And Karma takes on that role to help people learn. After all, if you might have been both, doesn't that change how you approach healing?
*\He would use another metaphor\*
It's like those shadow plays my grandmother loved. Behind the screen, one puppeteer plays all the parts---hero and villain, warrior and peace-maker, victim and perpetrator. *\He would smile\* Your soul is like that puppeteer, having played many roles across many lives.
*\His voice would carry deep conviction\*
This is why Wayism teaches us to work for justice without hatred, to seek healing without revenge. Because when you truly understand this teaching, who is there left to hate? Who remains to blame? Soul-people will be soul-people, and you have been soul-people in many lifetimes.
*\He would often end with characteristic humour\*
So next time you perform rituals to honor your ancestors, remember---you might be lighting incense to yourself! *\His eyes would twinkle\* Perhaps this is why some of our prayers seem to go unanswered---we're still working on becoming wise enough to answer them!
\Preserved with gratitude for teachings that challenge our deepest assumptions\

## The Eternal Way
*A teaching on the perennial nature of Wayism by Teacher +Yusa*
*\His eyes would hold that special light they had when speaking of The Way\*
Beloved ones, let me tell you about my grandmother's garden! *\He would smile warmly\* Year after year, she would plant her flowers, tend them, watch them bloom and fade. Different flowers came and went, but the soil, the sunlight, the seasons---these remained constant. This is how The Way is with religions.
*\He would often use such natural metaphors\*
You see, religions are like the flowers---they bloom, they flourish, they fade. Beautiful while they last! But The Way? *\His voice would deepen\* The Way is like the soil itself, like the sunlight, like the turning of seasons. It was here before the first seed sprouted, and it will be here after the last flower fades.
*\He would become more direct\*
Some ask me, "Teacher, is Wayism very old?" *\His eyes would twinkle\* Old? It's like asking if gravity is old! The Way isn't old or new---it simply is. Before Siddharta Buddha spoke of the Middle Way, before Krishna taught the Eight-fold Path, before Lao-tzu wrote of Tao---The Way was already here, forming the frame upon which they all build, waiting to be recognized by the spirit when the devotee is ready.
*\He would often use practical examples\*
Look at this cup of tea. *\He would lift his cup\* Different cultures have different ceremonies for preparing it, different names for drinking it, different rituals around serving it. But the nature of tea itself? That remains unchanged by all our names and customs!
*\His voice would take on a teaching quality\*
This is why Wayism seems so\... boring to some people! *\He would laugh warmly\* No fancy rituals, no dramatic ceremonies, no need for salvation by donating anything, no tickets to heaven for sale! Just the simple, logical understanding of how things are. Like gravity---it works whether you believe in it or not, whether you make ceremonies about it or not!
*\He would become more contemplative\*
Think of all the souls who have come before us, learning their lessons, graduating from Earth's schoolroom. Like students passing through a classroom---each class is different, but mathematics remains mathematics! Some graduate, new ones come, but the lessons stay the same.
*\He would often address practical concerns\*
"But Teacher," some ask, "why isn't Wayism more popular?" *\His eyes would sparkle with humour\* Ah! For the same reason that dhal aren't as popular as candy! Truth without sugar-coating and spices and colours can seem plain. We don't offer uniforms, or salvation for sale, we don't promise instant enlightenment. We simply point to The Way and say, "Look! This is how things work!" And soul-people look and say, "Nah, that's blah." And soul-people social engineers look and say, "We cant use that, it has no hierarchy, no authority, its useless to us." And tyrants look and say, "This is the most dangerous teaching ever, you teach people to own their own minds and shun the religions we use for world domination."
*\He would use another metaphor\*
It's like learning to swim. Some teachers might sell you fancy swimming costumes, special ceremonies to please the water spirits, magic words to keep you afloat. But The Way simply says: Here is the water, here is how it flows, here is how your body can move with it. Simple! Logical! *\He would smile\* And yes, perhaps a bit boring compared to water spirits and magic words!
*\His voice would deepen with wisdom\*
Remember this, beloved ones: We are not alone in the universe---we're not even particularly important in the cosmic scheme! *\He would often laugh here\* There are more species of beings out there than there are stars in the sky. Yet each of us, however small, has our purpose in The Way. And our purpose is to become spiritual beings, deities, buddhas.
*\He would end with characteristic warmth\*
So let others build their grand temples, sell their promises of salvation. We'll continue being good neighbours in the galaxy, learning our lessons, growing toward graduation. After all *\his eyes would twinkle\*, someone has to keep teaching basic math while others are selling magic multiplication wands! And, because soul-people are low on morality and principles, simply because they are soul-people not because there's something wrong with them, there will always be those who exploit them. Some believe their God gave them the immoral non-thinking soul-people of the world to exploit and they do it with pornography, drugs, abusive religions, and easy money scams, and they exploit their immorality and lack of principles, become wealthy. So, we must keep the torch and guard the flame, and be a bearer of light in their dark world.

## The Beauty of Being Real
A Teaching by +Yusa
*\Shared during a morning gathering, after noticing a student carefully arranging their meditation shawl for a photo\*
Ah, dear ones! *\His eyes twinkling with that special light they had when observing human nature\* This morning I watched something quite interesting. There was a cat in the garden, just being a cat -- washing its face, stretching in the sun. And nearby, a peacock was putting on quite a show, strutting and displaying its magnificent feathers. *\A gentle pause\* Both beautiful, yes? But such different kinds of beauty.
*\Settling into his teaching posture\*
You see, the peacock's display is meant to be seen and that's why he yells so loud and urgent, he is saying, "Hey you! Look at me!" Nothing wrong with that. *\A warm smile\* Nature loves to show off sometimes. But the cat\... ah, the cat has udbhu-kanti -- that natural radiance that comes from simply being what you are, without thinking about who might be watching.
*\Leaning forward, voice taking on that intimate teaching quality\*
These days, dear ones, we've become a world of peacocks. *\His eyes holding both humour and compassion\* Always displaying, always performing. "Look at my spiritual practice! See how mindfully I eat my breakfast! Notice how perfectly imperfect my life is!" *\A characteristic gentle chuckle\* We've become so good at performing authenticity that we've forgotten what it actually feels like to simply be.
*\Making that gesture he used when drawing attention to something important\*
Let me ask you something: When was the last time you watched a sunrise without thinking about sharing it? *\Pausing thoughtfully\* When did you last have a moment of joy that you didn't immediately try to capture or preserve? When did you last cry without wondering how you looked?
*\Taking a sip of tea\*
You know, in the old days, we used to talk about wearing masks in society. Now? *\His eyes twinkling\* Now we have digital manipulation to change how we look. Its as if all of life is now Bollywood and Hollywood. Not just on our photos, dear ones, but on our experiences, our emotions, our very way of being. Everything must be curated, arranged, presented just so.
*\Rising to walk a few steps\*
But udbhu-kanti -- that natural, unaffected beauty -- it's like the morning dew. Try to capture it, and it vanishes. Try to display it, and you're already lost. *\Touching his heart center\* It comes only from being genuinely what you are, where you are, as you are.
*\Turning back to his students, voice warming\*
I watched a young mother in the market yesterday. Her child had made a mess, and she was trying to clean it up while the baby laughed and made an even bigger mess. *\His eyes softening with appreciation\* She was completely unconcerned about how she looked, totally present in that messy, beautiful moment. That's udbhu-kanti! Not the carefully arranged photo albums of parenthood we see on social media, but the real, messy, glorious thing itself.
*\Sitting again, his voice taking on that quality it had when unveiling subtle truths\*
You see, dear ones, we've become so worried about documenting our journey that we've forgotten to actually make the journey. *\Making a flowing gesture\* We're like people studying the menu instead of eating the meal! Reading love poems instead of loving! Taking photos of the sunset instead of letting the sunset take us.
*\His voice softening to share a deeper truth\*
The greatest irony is this: true authenticity is the most beautiful thing in the world, but the moment you try to show it off, it disappears. *\A gentle smile\* Like trying to show someone your sleep face -- the very attempt defeats itself!
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
So perhaps today, just for a little while, we could experiment with being as natural as that cat in the garden. Not trying to be authentic -- trying isn't natural! -- but simply being what we are. *\Eyes twinkling\* After all, when you're truly being yourself, you don't need to check how it looks on Facebook!
Remember, dear ones, the moon doesn't practice shining. The rose doesn't rehearse its fragrance. And your true nature -- your udbhu-kanti -- is already perfect, if you'd just stop trying to perfect it.
The energy used to be something other than you---interferes with your spiritual growth.
\Preserved with gratitude for +Yusa's gift for showing us how to be as natural as breathing\

## Finding Home in the Heart
A Teaching by +Yusa
*\Shared on a chilly evening, after noticing a newly arrived family huddled together in the market\*
Ah, dear ones, *\his eyes holding that special tenderness they had when touching on deep human struggles\* today I watched something that reminded me of my parents. A family -- new here in Mumbai, you could tell by their uncertain gestures, their searching eyes -- trying to buy vegetables in our market. They knew the vegetables, yes, but not the words, not the customs, not the cold faces turning away from their warm smiles.
*\Settling into his teaching posture, adjusting his worn shawl\*
You see, my parents understood this dance. *\His voice carrying echoes of old memories\* My father, a Sufi dervish, my mother from an Armenian Christian family -- both refugees from a world that had turned against them. When I was small, I used to watch my mother trying to make conversation with neighbours who didn't want to understand her accent. *\A gentle smile\* But every evening, she would light her candles, say her prayers, and somehow her whole being would settle into peace.
*\Leaning forward, voice warming\*
These days, millions moved across our Earth, leaving behind the warm embrace of communities where everyone knows everyone, where neighbours share meals without asking, where children belong to the whole street. *\Making that characteristic gesture of reaching out\* They come to lands of tall buildings and closed doors, where people have forgotten how to be neighbours, where even families live like strangers.
*\Taking a thoughtful sip of tea\*
You know what's interesting? *\His eyes twinkling\* These newcomers often think they're just changing places. But they're moving between different ways of being human. From societies where connection is like breathing -- natural, necessary, constant -- to places where people pride themselves on "not needing anyone."
*\Rising to warm his hands by the small stove\*
I remember asking my father once, "How did you stay whole when everything was broken?" *\His voice taking on that quality it had when sharing precious memories\* He smiled -- ah, how he could smile! -- and said, "Because, my son, true wholeness isn't in where you are, but in what you carry."
*\Turning back to his students, eyes bright with engaged presence\*
What my parents carried was something precious -- a way of being rooted not in place, but in truth. *\Touching his heart center\* Their practices, their prayers, their philosophy of life -- these weren't just rituals, you see. They were like internal compass needles, always pointing to what's real, what's true, what endures.
*\Sitting again, voice softening\*
To those millions moving across our world right now, *\his voice holding deep compassion\* your hearts remember something many have forgotten -- that humans need each other like flowers need rain. You feel the absence of community like a physical pain because you know, in your bones, what real community feels like.
*\Making that flowing gesture he used when connecting ideas\*
But here's something beautiful -- *\his eyes brightening\* -- you also carry seeds of that warmth within you. Like my parents did. The philosophies that taught you how to be human, the spiritualities that showed you how to find meaning, the wisdom that helps you distinguish between what's real and what's merely comfortable.
*\His voice taking on that teaching tone that could make profound truths feel accessible\*
Perhaps this is the hidden gift in your journey. *\A gentle smile\* In lands where hearts have grown cold, you bring the memory of warmth. In places where neighbours have forgotten how to neighbor, you bring the knowledge of true community. Your very struggles might be teaching others what they've forgotten about being human.
The last thing I would have wanted to see my parents do was to adapt and become like them who treated us all badly because we have a different religion and different values. We honour the roots of goodness in us. After all, we worked many lifetimes for that dharma, its who we had become. There is no way we will become like them who are soul-people similar to whom we were eight lifetimes ago.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle compassion\*
And remember, dear ones, *\gesturing to include everyone\* whether you're newly arrived or have forgotten how to welcome others -- we're all somehow displaced until we find our home in wisdom, in chrestotes, in the kind of understanding that doesn't need a shared language to recognize shared humanity.
After all, *\his eyes twinkling with that special light\* the sun doesn't shine differently on any of us, does it? And the rain falls on all gardens, whether we know their names or not.
\Preserved with gratitude for +Yusa's gift for finding hope in displacement and wisdom in the spaces between worlds\

## The Speed of Wisdom
A Teaching by +Yusa
*\Shared while preparing tea during a morning gathering, just as someone's phone buzzed with another urgent notification\*
Ah, dear ones! \His eyes twinkling as he slowly warmed the teapot\ I see your little devices are very hungry today. Always buzzing, always demanding attention. Like baby birds, aren't they? \A gentle smile\ Always crying "Feed me! Feed me! Right now!"
\Beginning the careful process of preparing tea\
You know, the other day someone showed me something quite remarkable on something they called Usenet -- they called it a "TL;DR." *\His eyes holding both amusement and concern\* "Too Long, Didn't Read." They were quite proud of how it could reduce entire essays and teachings to a few bullet points. *\Mindfully measuring the tea leaves\* As if wisdom were something to be swallowed like a pill!
*\Pouring the first water to warm the pot, watching it steam\*
These days, everything must be instant, mustn't it? *\Making that characteristic gesture of observation\* Instant messages, instant food, instant enlightenment! *\A gentle chuckle\* "Seven Steps to Spiritual Success!" "Five-Minute Meditation Miracle!" Even our email gets impatient when they have to wait more than a a few seconds for something to load.
*\Emptying the warming water, his movements deliberate and focused\*
But tell me, dear ones -- *\pausing to really look at his students\* -- have you ever seen an orchid grow instantly? Has any pearl ever formed in an oyster overnight? *\Adding fresh tea leaves with careful attention\* Even this simple pot of tea knows better than to rush.
*\Pouring the water in a slow spiral\*
You see, there's something interesting happening to us. *\His voice taking on that quality it had when unveiling subtle truths\* We've begun to mistake information for wisdom. We think because we can ask Google an answer in seconds, we can understand it just as quickly. *\Watching the leaves begin their slow dance\* But wisdom\... ah, wisdom has its own timing.
*\Setting the lid and waiting, completely present in the pause\*
Look at how these leaves need time to unfold, to release their essence. Try to rush them, and you'll get something bitter, something incomplete. *\His eyes holding both humour and compassion\* Rather like those "Weekend Enlightenment Workshops," hmm?
*\Making that flowing gesture he used when connecting ideas\*
In the old days, they say it took seven years of study just to learn how to sit properly for meditation. *\A warm smile\* Today, people get frustrated if their meditation music takes too long to download! But you see, this slowness wasn't about being inefficient -- it was about understanding that some things cannot be rushed.
*\Beginning to pour the tea with focused attention\*
Even our technology knows this truth, though it tries to hide it. *\His eyes twinkling\* Those clever modems that seem so fast? Behind them are massive data centers, huge cables crossing oceans, satellites orbiting in space -- all built slowly, carefully, over many years. *\Passing cups with mindful awareness\* Just like wisdom, the instant result rests on a foundation that took great time to build.
*\Taking a slow, appreciative sip\*
You know what's fascinating? *\Setting his cup down thoughtfully\* The same people who demand instant everything in their daily lives will spend hours watching a video of someone slowly, mindfully preparing food or crafting something by hand. *\A knowing smile\* Perhaps their souls remember something their minds have forgotten?
*\His voice softening with compassion\*
I worry sometimes, seeing young ones who've never known a world that wasn't instant. *\Touching his heart center\* You can't download understanding, dear ones. You can't scroll down for wisdom.
*\Pouring the second steeping with the same careful attention as the first\*
Perhaps this is why our traditional practices seem so strange now -- so slow, so\... inefficient. *\Making that gesture he used when distinguishing important points\* But efficiency isn't always wisdom. The shortest distance between two points might be a straight line, but the most beautiful path usually isn't. There is no more-efficient path to true spirituality, the soul will take the time it needs and slow is the normal time, lifetimes even. You can read Teachings of theWAY slow or by speed no matter---but you will still be reading it in thirty years from now because wisdom builds slowly in layers upon layers and the same line of teaching now will means something deeper in twenty years.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
So perhaps next time your computer messaging thing demands instant attention, you could smile and say, "Ah, but wisdom steeps slowly, like good tea." *\His eyes twinkling\* After all, have you ever seen a notification that said "Your soul needs time to unfold. No response required"?

## Layers of Understanding
A Teaching by +Yusa
*\Shared during a morning session, after a student proudly showed him how many spiritual books they had downloaded overnight\*
Ah, dear ones! \His eyes twinkling with that special light\ Someone has become very rich in information, I see. \A gentle smile\ Hundreds of sacred texts, all sitting on a shiny CD disk -- like trying to fit an ocean in a teacup!
*\Settling into his teaching posture, brushing some market dust from his robe\*
You know, this reminds me of a young monk I once knew. *\His voice taking on that storyteller's quality\* He had memorized entire sutras, could quote every scripture, knew all the commentaries. One day, he saw an old woman sharing her last piece of bread with a stranger. *\Pausing meaningfully\* In that moment, all his book-knowledge turned to ash in his mouth. He understood something no text could teach him.
*\Leaning forward slightly\*
These days, people say, "But Teacher, we have everything at our fingertips! All the world's wisdom, just a click away!" *\Making that characteristic gesture of discernment\* Yes, and you can read every book ever written about swimming, but until you get in the water\... Don't confuse knowledge with wisdom, don't confuse reading with gaining knowledge, don't confuse owning the book with having its wisdom.
*\Taking a thoughtful sip of tea\*
Let me share something about how wisdom grows. *\His voice taking on that quality it had when unveiling subtle truths\* First, there's information -- like knowing water is made of hydrogen and oxygen. Then there's knowledge -- like understanding how water behaves, its patterns and properties. But wisdom? *\Eyes twinkling\* Wisdom is knowing how to find water in the desert, how to want to share it when it's scarce, how to appreciate it even when it's plentiful, how to use it to store the right energies and how to infuse it with healing energies.
*\Rising to walk a few steps\*
You see, information can be copied and pasted. Knowledge can be tested and measured. *\Making that flowing gesture he used when distinguishing levels\* But wisdom? Wisdom has to be lived. It's like the difference between reading about love and falling in love, between studying about pain and transforming through it.
*\Turning back to his students, eyes bright with engaged presence\*
I remember when they first brought computers to our area. *\A warm smile\* Someone showed me how quickly it could calculate the precise time of sunrise. Very impressive! But you know what's interesting? *\Touching his heart center\* It couldn't tell you how sunrise feels, or what it means to a farmer's heart, or why watching it makes some people cry with gratitude and awe.
*\Settling again, adjusting his position to ease his old injuries\*
These days, you can ask an online expert to explain the deepest philosophies, and it will give you beautiful, accurate answers. *\His voice holding both appreciation and discernment\* But can it tell you why your heart breaks when you see suffering? Can it show you how to transform that heartbreak into compassion?
*\Making that gesture he used when reaching the heart of a teaching\*
You see, information says, "Water is H^2^O." Knowledge says, "Water flows downhill and takes the shape of its container." But wisdom? \His eyes holding that special light\ Wisdom knows why we cry, why tears can taste of sorrow but another time of joy, why the arid land values water more than gold.
*\His voice softening with compassion\*
I worry sometimes, seeing young ones who think if they download enough books, memorize enough quotes, collect enough information, they'll become wise. \A gentle smile\ It's like thinking if you collect enough photographs of fire, you'll eventually get warm!
*\Rising again, his voice taking on that teaching tone that could make complex ideas feel simple\*
Information can be instant, yes. Knowledge takes longer -- like learning a skill or mastering a craft. But wisdom? *\Making that characteristic gesture of opening\* Wisdom needs living. It needs failing and getting up again. It needs broken hearts and healing hands. It needs the kind of understanding that comes only from walking the path yourself.
Here, in our area, we see all too many "spiritual travellers" coming through. They come for interviews to join ashrams. They come with memorised phrases from books sold in the West mostly and they come ready to quote it at inappropriate times. Many think that body odour from unwashed hair and bodies is a sign of spiritual wisdom. So many can recite chapters of holy books. But they don't come with open minds to live, to live to become wise. They come for spring break and want enlightenment before going back so they can open a yoga studio and teach spirituality. And if some charlatan down the road has sex with them and tell them it was tantra, all the better they feel and then they will teach tantra as well.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
So perhaps next time you download another hundred books of wisdom *\eyes twinkling\*, you might ask yourself: Am I collecting water, or learning how to swim? Am I gathering information about the path, or walking it?
After all, dear ones, you can own all the maps in the world and still be lost in your own garden. Or you can own no maps at all and know exactly where you are in the world, simply by being fully present to each step of the journey.

## The Hidden Flow of Wisdom
A Teaching by +Yusa
*\Shared during a quiet evening, after someone expressed guilt about maintaining their traditional religious practices while following theWAY\*
Ah, dear ones, let me tell you about that prison guard again. *\His eyes holding that special depth they had when approaching delicate truths\* You see, he wore the uniform of those who imprisoned me, said the right words, followed all the rules. But in those brief moments when he slipped me water, when his eyes met mine with simple human recognition -- *\touching his heart center\* -- I saw something beautiful: wisdom flowering in secret.
*\Settling into his teaching posture, voice warming\*
You know, it's interesting how wisdom grows. *\Making that characteristic gesture of observation\* Sometimes it's like a tree in the town square, visible to all. But often -- more often than you might think -- it's like those plants that grow in the cracks between stones. Hidden, quiet, but very much alive.
*\Leaning forward slightly\*
I remember a Hindu priest I knew, years ago. *\His voice taking on that storyteller's quality\* Officially, he maintained all the strict caste traditions his position required. But if you watched carefully, you'd see how he would find ways to serve the untouchables without anyone noticing. A bit of food left where hungry children would find it, a healing herb dropped quietly at a sick person's door. *\A gentle smile\* He couldn't leave his position -- his whole extended family depended on it. But wisdom found its way through, like water flowing underground.
These are the people who, when they get hold of our simple teaching of higher-self spirit awareness, of the Butterfly Path, they drink it up like parched land drinks rain, and you can see in their demeanour how so many wisdom seeds germinate and new life returns to that seeking soul and awakened spirit. They become deeply Wayist while maintaining their lifestyles for whatever reason they may have. The history of Wayism is replete with saints and sages and writer and mystic poets who had to love like this, hiding their light under a cloak for practical reasons.
*\Taking a thoughtful sip of tea\*
These days, people think transformation must be dramatic -- big announcements, breaking all ties, starting fresh. *\His eyes twinkling\* Very exciting! Very theatrical! But you know what's interesting? *\Pausing meaningfully\* Nature's deepest changes often happen in secret. The seed cracks open in the dark earth. The butterfly forms inside the hidden chrysalis. Its a gradual process.
*\Rising to walk a few steps\*
There are Wayists in every tradition, dear ones. \His voice taking on that quality it had when sharing precious truths\ Some can openly declare it, yes. But others -- the imam who finds ways to welcome everyone, the rabbi who teaches love beyond the letter of law, the monk who quietly breaks with tradition to serve where service is needed -- they must work like yeast in bread. Unseen, but transforming everything they touch.
*\Turning back to his students, eyes bright with engaged presence\*
You see, when wisdom dawns in a heart, it doesn't always announce itself with trumpets. *\Making that flowing gesture he used when illuminating subtle points\* Sometimes it has to move like that guard in the prison -- doing what it can, when it can, in the ways that are possible.
*\Settling again, voice softening\*
I know some of you struggle with this. *\His eyes holding deep compassion\* You feel the truth of theWAY in your hearts, but your families, your communities, your whole way of life is woven into your traditional religion. You wonder if you're being dishonest by not declaring everything openly.
*\Making that gesture he used when reaching the heart of a teaching\*
But consider this: Is the river dishonest because it flows underground sometimes? Is the seed dishonest because it transforms in darkness? *\A warm smile\* There are times when wisdom must flow like secret streams, finding its way through the landscape of life without destroying the gardens others have built.
What would be dishonest is if the river flows as it flows but refuses to give a bit of itself to the plants and seeds, to the goat and the deer who wants a drink. The Wayist always remembers and honours its source and gives back too, to help us bring the same water that wet their parched soil, also to others. It is only a person with no wisdom who can say what we hear in ashrams so often, "Wisdom was freely begotten and must be freely given". When you hear that, recall Lord Iesous' teaching in this regard, "Do not throw pearls before swine, not only will they trample it in the mud but they will turn on you and rend you." When you hear someone say that, stop serving them; they may harm you and the teaching.
*\His voice taking on that teaching tone that could make complex truths feel simple\*
This is why we say theWAY flows through all genuine traditions. *\Touching his heart center\* Sometimes openly, like a river in the sunlight. Sometimes hidden, like springs under the earth. But always flowing, always moving, always finding its path.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
So perhaps next time you feel troubled about maintaining your traditional practices while your heart follows theWAY, remember that guard. Remember that priest. Remember all those quiet servants of wisdom who found ways to let love flow without needing to announce it.
After all, dear ones, *\eyes twinkling\* even the moon doesn't try to outshine the sun -- it simply reflects the sun and glows with when and how it can.

## Marks of the Heart
A Teaching by +Yusa
*\Shared after a Western student asked about wearing some symbol to show they were Wayist, fidgeting with their plain clothes while glancing at the elaborate robes of nearby Buddhist monks\*
Ah, dear ones! \His eyes crinkling with that special warmth they had when addressing heart-longings\ This wish for a sign, a mark, something to say "This is who I am, this is where I belong" -- \touching his heart center\ -- it's such a human need, isn't it?
*\Settling onto his cushion, dust from the market still on his simple clothes\*
You know, just yesterday I was watching some birds making their nests. *\His voice taking on that storyteller's quality\* Each kind of bird builds differently -- the weaver birds with their elaborate hanging homes, the doves with their simple platforms. *\A gentle smile\* And I thought: how human this is, this need to show who we are, to mark our belonging.
*\Leaning forward slightly\*
But let me ask you something interesting. *\His eyes twinkling\* When you meet someone truly wise, truly compassionate, truly awake -- do you need them to wear a badge saying so? *\Pausing thoughtfully\* When you encounter real love, real understanding, does it need a uniform?
*\Making that characteristic gesture of observation\*
I understand this yearning, dear ones. *\His voice holding deep compassion\* We humans are tribal creatures. We want our tribe to be visible, our belonging to be clear. When others wear robes or special marks or have certain haircuts, something in us says, "Ah, but what is my mark? Where is my sign?" We even go into debt to buy a car or a suit that shows our economic or social rank. Even though others are wise to know we've just made a lot of debt and we cant afford what millionaires drive, a lot of people will still nestle close to you because you appear so wealthy.
*\Taking a thoughtful sip of tea\*
Let me share something with you about marks and signs. *\His voice taking on that quality it had when unveiling subtle truths\* When I was imprisoned, they took everything from me -- every outer sign of who I was. *\A warm smile\* But you know what's fascinating? The other prisoners still knew who to come to for comfort. The guards still knew who radiated peace. No signs needed.
*\Rising to walk a few steps\*
These days, you can buy any spiritual symbol you want online! *\A characteristic gentle chuckle\* Mala beads, crosses, crystals, special clothes -- all overnight delivery! Very convenient. But you know what can't be delivered overnight? *\Eyes twinkling\* The light in your eyes when you've understood something deep. The warmth in your voice when you speak from true compassion. The peace in your presence when you've found your center.
*\Turning back to his students, voice softening\*
I knew a man once who spent all his money on the perfect spiritual wardrobe. *\Making that gesture he used when sharing something precious\* Organic cotton, all the right colors, all the proper symbols. Very impressive! But he would get angry if he or someone spilled tea on his special clothes. *\Letting that sink in\* While the truly holy ones I known? Most of them looked like anybody else -- until you looked in their eyes.
*\Settling again, adjusting his simple robe\*
You see, theWAY has always been like water. *\Making that flowing gesture he used when reaching the heart of a teaching\* Water doesn't need to wear a sign saying "I am water." It simply flows, nurtures, refreshes. Its nature is its mark.
*\His voice taking on that teaching tone that could make complex ideas feel simple\*
Perhaps this is why we don't have special marks or robes. Not because such things are wrong -- they can be beautiful! But because theWAY asks something more challenging of us: to be so genuinely who we are that no outer sign is needed.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
So yes, dear ones, I hear this longing in your hearts. And if you really feel you need some outer sign, well\... *\Eyes twinkling\* perhaps let it be the light in your eyes when you help someone. Let it be the warmth in your smile when you meet a stranger. Let it be the peace in your presence that makes others ask, "What is it about you that feels like home?"
After all, *\Rising, brushing dust from his simple clothes\* the sun doesn't wear a badge saying "I am bright." It simply shines.
*\Walking over to the questioner, handing her the mala he has used for nine years, without saying a word to her\*
Many of us need a something we hold dear to help anchor us in a high spiritual vibration, elevating of consciousness to a high spirit-mind. These are excellent tools. They serve the brain-mind to quickly attune to the higher-self minds. I carry, as you all know, a mala just for that purpose. Its a tool that my brain-mind likes to have around and that is why I touch it aften during the day, it helps brain-mind stay attuned and feel warm and cosy. So, we often carry things but not for outer display. We have no need to announce to society wherever we are what our spirituality is, just as we have no need to wear badges to announce to the world which gender of person we like to have sexual relations with, or which political party we favour.

## The Limits of Understanding
A Teaching by +Yusa
*\Shared during a starlit evening, after a student claimed to \"almost understand\" the nature of the Absolute but needs a bit more help\*
Ah, dear ones! *\His eyes twinkling with that special light they had when about to lovingly demolish spiritual pride\* Let\'s talk about numbers for a moment. Simple things, numbers. We all understand them, yes? *\A gentle smile\* Well, let\'s see.
*\Settling into his teaching posture\*
If I were to give you one grain of rice every second, how long would it take to give you a billion grains? *\Pausing thoughtfully\* Your brain might say, \"Well, that\'s easy to calculate!\" But let\'s feel it. At one grain per second, it would take\... nearly 32 years. *\Letting that sink in\* Just to count to a billion, one number per second, never sleeping or taking a break, would take longer than many of you have been alive!
*\Leaning forward, voice warming with engaged presence\*
Now, imagine our galaxy -- the Milky Way. *\Gesturing to the stars above\* Scientists tell us it contains somewhere around 100 billion stars. That\'s one hundred times longer than our grain-of-rice counting! *\His eyes holding both wonder and humour\* And yet, dear ones, this is just one galaxy among\... how many? Current estimates suggest there are around 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe.
*\Making that characteristic gesture he used when building to a point\*
Let\'s try to feel this. If each grain of rice we counted represented an entire galaxy, it would take over 6,000 years of counting without sleeping or taking a toilet break, one galaxy per second, just to count the galaxies we can see. *\A gentle smile\* And remember, each of those galaxies contains billions of stars, and many of those stars have planets, and on some of those planets\... well, you see where this is going.
*\Taking a sip of tea\*
But here\'s the beautiful part -- *\his voice taking on that quality it had when unveiling subtle truths\* -- all of this vastness, this incomprehensible enormity, is still just the manifest universe. Just the part we can theoretically count! And that is only the Domain of Material Energy that exists within the confines of The Way. The Absolute transcends even this.
Back to the three Domains. We just tried to count the galaxies in the Domain of Material Energy. You know of course that just like the atom, most of the space is \"empty\" and the matter takes up about 2% of the space. Well, the same with the space we looked at where the galaxies are. The so-called \"empty space\" is filled with two other energy domains, Domain of Soul Energy and Domains of Spirit Energy and each of those have their own structures inside. Lets just assume for argument sake each of Soul and Spirit Energy domains have the same number of structures in that space. Now that gets interesting.
We cannot begin to count it, never mind define it, and of course impossible to know it. And that is only the organized structure which we call The Way.
And how many of these types of structures are in the Absolute? We don\'t know, it may be ten or it may be infinite.
Lets feel it. The math shows this metaphor is close to real. Imagine you are on a beach overlooking the ocean and you realize that all the way across, 6,000 miles across, there is Japan. That part of the ocean is so wide. Now imagine the piece of beach sand that is stuck on your finger, that is Earth. Imagine it is populated by trillions of beings like microbes. And you are one of them. Now, look around, and look across the ocean, and up to the sky. Imagine that all you can now imagine is the universe and you---you are one of the microbes on the piece of sand on your finger. That piece of sand that you will now be very reluctant to wipe or flick away after this.
*\Rising to walk a few steps under the stars\*
Your brain, this remarkable instrument that evolution has given us, can hold perhaps seven pieces of information in its immediate awareness. Seven! *\A characteristic gentle laugh\* And yet some of us think we can comprehend That Which Is Beyond All Numbers?
Do you now begin to get an idea why Wayism teaches Humility is an essential spiritual skill to develop wisdom and become a spirit being?
*\Turning back to his students, eyes bright with compassion\*
Even time defeats us. If I ask you to truly imagine what a million years feels like -- not just say the words, but feel it in your bones -- you cannot. If I ask you to genuinely comprehend the age of our universe as scientists tell us for a certain absolute fact they know it for sure, *\wink\* about 13.8 billion years, your mind offers you a number, but not understanding.
*\Sitting again, his voice softening\*
This is why our ancestors were so wise when they spoke of the Absolute as \"That Which Cannot Be Named,\" or simply \"That.\" *\Touching his heart centre\* Even the word \"infinite\" is misleading -- it tempts us to think we\'ve captured the uncapturable in a word.
\Making a flowing gesture with his hands\
This is also why we have our heavens, our deities, our spirit-beings that we can relate to. They are like\... *\pausing thoughtfully\* like stepping stones across a limitless ocean. We can reach them, know them, love them. But the ocean itself? *\Eyes twinkling\* Even the fish don\'t comprehend the ocean -- they simply swim in it.
*\His voice taking on that special quality it had when approaching final wisdom\*
And this is the beautiful paradox, dear ones. The moment we truly understand that we cannot comprehend the Absolute -- that\'s when real wisdom begins! \A warm smile\ Like a child relaxing in their parent\'s arms, we can rest in That Which Is Beyond Understanding.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
After all, even if you spent your whole life counting grains of rice, one per second, you wouldn\'t reach a billion. So perhaps instead of counting, we should simply be grateful for today\'s bowl of rice, yes? *\Eyes twinkling\* And perhaps instead of trying to comprehend the Absolute, we should simply rest in its presence, like stars floating in the infinite night.
*\He sits back and lets it all sink in. We all sit in awe and feel so humbled. Then after a while, teacher sips his tea and his eyes lighting up with that special warmth they held when building upon a truth\*

## Living Spirituality
A Teaching by +Yusa
\Shared during an early evening walk in the garden, pausing to observe a bee visiting the last flowers of the day\
Ah, dearone, look at this little bee. *\His eyes holding that special warmth they had when nature was teaching through him\* Even now, as the day fades, she's fully engaged in her work. Not thinking about being spiritual -- simply being what she is, fully and completely. What a teacher she is!
*\Settling onto a garden bench, his voice taking on that intimate teaching quality\*
You see, when people speak of spirituality, they often imagine something separate from life -- something you do in special places, at special times, wearing special clothes. *\A gentle smile\* But true spirituality is like breathing. It changes us whether we're thinking about it or not.
*\Leaning forward slightly, voice warming\*
The other day, someone asked me, "Teacher, how can I be more spiritual?" *\His eyes twinkling\* I asked them, "How can you be more alive?" Because that's what real spirituality does -- it makes us more alive to everything: the good, the difficult, the beautiful, the challenging.
*\Making that characteristic gesture he used when counting important points\*
First, dear ones, we must understand that spirituality begins with attitude. *\Touching his heart center\* Not the grand attitudes that we show the world, but the simple ones: gratitude for this breath, humility before the vastness of life, simplicity in our approach to each moment, compassion for all beings -- even ourselves! *\A knowing smile\*
*\His voice taking on that quality it had when unveiling subtle truths\*
But here's something interesting -- we don't achieve these attitudes by thinking about them. *\Gesturing to the garden around them\* We cultivate them through awareness. Like a gardener who knows the feel of living soil, we develop a feel for the presence of the Divine in all things.
*\Rising to walk a few steps, then pausing\*
Look at this evening light touching the mountains. *\His voice softening with wonder\* The Divine isn't just in the light -- it's in our ability to see it, to be moved by it. It's in the tiredness in our legs after a long day, in the hunger that makes our simple meal taste like a feast, in the frustration that teaches us patience.
*\Turning back to his students, eyes bright with engaged presence\*
This is why we say our spirituality is mystical. Not because we have grand visions or supernatural experiences -- though those may come -- but because we're constantly discovering the extraordinary within the ordinary. *\A characteristic gentle laugh\* The real miracle isn't walking on water, dear ones -- it's walking on earth with full awareness!
*\Sitting again, his voice taking on that special teaching tone\*
Some think meditation is spirituality. *\Shaking his head slightly\* Meditation is like sharpening a knife. Important, yes! But the real work happens when we use that sharpened awareness to cut through illusion in our daily lives. When we engage with life -- all of it! The joys, the sorrows, the excitements, the challenges.
*\Making a flowing gesture with his hands\*
This is existential living, you see. Not hiding in caves contemplating our navels, but meeting each moment with full presence. *\His eyes holding both wisdom and humour\* Sometimes people say, "But Teacher, my life is so ordinary!" Ah, but that's exactly where the extraordinary hides!
*\Rising as the last light fades, his voice warming with final wisdom\*
Remember, dear ones -- the bee doesn't try to be spiritual. She simply lives her bee-nature fully. Our human-nature includes this amazing capacity for awareness, for recognition of the Divine in all things. \A gentle smile\ So perhaps true spirituality is simply living our full human-nature, with all its messy glory and beautiful imperfection, contemplating meaning, introspecting, self-awareness, and self-craft. All that but we cannot do it without first being the bee.
*\Concluding with that characteristic mix of wisdom and gentle humour\*
After all, if the Divine is truly in all things, then being spiritual is simply being awake enough to notice what's already here. *\Eyes twinkling in the gathering dusk\* Even in this moment, when we're all thinking about dinner!

## To Make the World a Better Place
*\As students gathered for the evening's teaching, one raised this profound question about making the world better. +Yusa's eyes softened with that special warmth they held when about to share a particularly beautiful truth\*
Dear one, your desire to improve the world speaks well of your heart. But let me share something wonderful about the path you're already walking.
*\Settling into his teaching posture\*
When we maintain higher-self energies through our spiritual practice, something remarkable happens - often without our awareness. We become like a tuning fork of peace, unconsciously attuning the energies around us to a higher vibration. Just as a calm lake naturally smooths ripples on its surface, your presence begins to harmonize discordant energies in your environment.
*\Gesturing to the space around them\*
Think of it as creating a sphere of benevolent energy that radiates outward from you. You don't need to do anything special - simply being in this state of higher consciousness naturally creates this effect. Some people will be drawn to this energy, though they may not know why. They might find themselves feeling mysteriously calmer or uplifted in your presence. Others may observe you more closely, noticing something different about your way of being, something they discover they want for themselves.
*\His voice taking on that quality it had when revealing subtle truths\*
This is how we make the world better - not through grand gestures or forceful actions, but simply by being authentically who we are, maintaining our practice, living in humility and simplicity. Like a candle that lights other candles without diminishing its own flame, your presence alone can ignite transformation in others.
Do you want to know how to lose that light? Its not hard to do. When we become aware of it and it "goes to your head" as they say, the light fades as humility fades. If you see someone walking around with a smug look on the face believing they have that effect on people but they don't, you know how that delusion came upon them. Here in Rishikesh there's quite a few of those around, its an integral part of the economy here. Be grateful to them for teaching this important lesson all on the Path must learn.
*\Gesturing to the garden outside\*
Moreover, as we progress on the Path, we naturally develop deeper awareness of and connection with all beings. The trees in the park become friends, the birds our neighbours, the flowing stream our teacher. This shift in consciousness creates ripples of positive change - these places become zones of harmony, sanctuaries where all beings can thrive. When we treat these spaces as sacred, others begin to sense and respect their sanctity too.
*\Taking a sip of tea before continuing\*
And yes, there are also practical ways to help. Sharing Wayist books, volunteering time to help create and translate publications, offering your skills in editing or proofreading - these acts help ensure that others who are seeking will find these teachings when they need them most. We never know when someone might face a crisis that leads them to seek deeper meaning. By helping maintain and share these resources, we ensure they'll be there when needed.
*\His eyes holding both wisdom and compassion\*
Remember, dear ones - we don't need to force change or convert others. We simply need to be authentic in our practice, maintain our higher-self energy, and remain open to sharing when asked. The world becomes better not because we set out to improve it, but because we ourselves become vessels of harmony and truth.
In this way, making the world better becomes not a goal to strive for, but a natural consequence of walking the Path with sincerity and grace.
\Preserved with gratitude for +Yusa's insight into how transformation occurs through being rather than doing\
52
## A Final Word of Hope
\Speaking with warm conviction\
Before we part today, my dear ones, let me remind you of something essential. While we have examined difficult truths, remember that the very fact that you can recognize these patterns means you are already awakening. This is cause for joy!
Look around you. Despite all we've discussed, there are people everywhere breaking free from these conditioned patterns. In small communities, in unexpected places, people are rediscovering authentic ways of living and being. They are creating local economies based on real human needs, building relationships founded on genuine care rather than transaction, and measuring wealth by the depth of their spiritual understanding rather than the size of their bank accounts.
*\Leaning forward with gentle intensity\*
You too can be part of this transformation. Start small. Perhaps begin by examining one habitual thought or behaviour each day. Ask yourself: "Is this truly mine, or is it programmed? Does this serve spiritual growth or hinder it?"
Remember what I often say - the butterfly doesn't fight the caterpillar; it simply maintains awareness of the transformation and becomes what it truly is. Your task is not to wage war against lower minds and conditioning, but to mature and grow beyond it naturally, organically, joyfully.
*\Sitting back with a warm smile\*
And yes, sometimes we will still get caught up in the world's games - buying those expensive offering flowers, so to speak. When this happens, laugh at yourself gently and begin again. This too is part of the path.
May all beings awaken to their true nature. May all beings be free from delusion. May all beings walk the path of authentic transformation.
## About the Editor
Teacher Pradeep (1952-2023), born Pradeep Panicker in Kerala state, India, later became known as Pradeep Thomas Panicker---a name change attributed to bureaucratic requirements and, as he would often quip, a creative spelling by a Mumbai clerk who ordained him as a Wayist Teacher added an \"h\" to his name to become +pradheep. A distinguished scholar of Eastern Christianity and Wayism, he served as a member of the Ancient Church of the East and made significant contributions to religious scholarship as part of the team that produced the English translation of the Eastern Bible (1989-1996). Until his passing in 2023, Teacher Pradheep was an integral member of the Salvar Dàosenglu editorial team, where he dedicated himself to the compilation and translation of Wayist texts into English, helping to preserve and share these important spiritual teachings with a broader audience.

## Symbols used in theWAY
Three symbols in particular carry special significance for Wayists: theWAY official logo, the Butterfly Path symbol, and the Lotus.
### theWAY Logo
The logo of theWAY brings together several layers of meaning through its elegant design:
**The Color Spectrum**\
Corresponding to the seven chakra energy centers, from the root to the crown --- representing the complete integration of all aspects of being --- physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.
**The Lotus Foundation**\
Interwoven into this design are numerous elements of significance to theWAY symbolism:
***Divine Potential*** \~ The seed of divine potential lies within each of us. ****\
***Lotus Blooming*** \~ Like the lotus that rises from murky depths to bloom, it represents the soul\'s journey from ignorance to enlightenment. The petals arranged in concentric circles suggest the unfolding of consciousness.****\
***Community Connection*** \~ Speaking to the Wayist understanding of universal interconnectedness and the importance of community on the spiritual journey.****\
***Butterfly Path*** \~ The butterfly wings, connecting the core teaching of the Butterfly Path --- the soul\'s transformation into an immortal spiritual being.****\
***Energy Flow*** \~ Flowing infinity lines embody the principle of energy movement and transformation.****\
***Interconnectedness*** \~ Everything is interconnected on all levels, everything is energy. ****\
***YinYang*** \~ The eternal balance of Yin and Yang energies, fundamental forces that permeate all existence.
### **The Butterfly Path Symbol**
This ancient symbol, dating back approximately 2,000 years, captures the essence of the spiritual journey in visual form:
***Upward Spiral*** \~ The ascending spiral pattern represents the soul\'s evolutionary journey through multiple incarnations, each cycle bringing greater wisdom and awareness.****\
***Gathering Energy*** \~ The gathering of energy spirals at the base of the design suggest that we harness our energies and embark on our journey.****\
***Energy Elements*** \~ The flow of energy that is continuous reminds us of the journey with its twist and turns, of our ultimate destiny --- to emerge from our chrysalis state into fully realized spiritual beings.****\
***Central Axis*** \~ The vertical energy flow suggests the alignment of lower and higher selves, the integration of soul and spirit.****\
***Points of Transformation*** \~ Key points along the spiral mark critical stages of spiritual awakening and transformation.****\
***Lotus*** \~ The lotus always reaching for the light, as we are towards our enlightenment. The lotus rooted in the mud, growing through murky waters, reaching for the light, and bursting into bloom --- symbolic of our diversity, strengths, focused authenticity and potential.
### The Lotus
The lotus flower plant profound significance in Wayist teaching, representing the soul\'s journey from ignorance to enlightenment. Like the lotus seed descending into murky depths before sprouting, rising through muddy waters to bloom in pristine beauty above the surface, so does the soul plunge into worldly experience before ascending to spiritual awakening. The lotus teaches us to find nourishment even in difficult circumstances, to rise steadily toward the light while remaining pure and unsullied by surroundings, and to offer shelter and inspiration to others along the way. Its daily cycle of closing and opening reminds us of the value of both solitude and renewal, while its ability to thrive in both murky and biologically active water and in clear still waters teaches us to maintain equanimity in all circumstances
In Wayist tradition, symbols serve not as objects of veneration but as bridges to deeper understanding. They are tools that help focus the mind and inspire contemplation of profound truths. As visual teaching, they speak directly to both conscious and unconscious aspects of our being, gently guiding us toward deeper understanding of theWAY.
In meditation and daily life, these symbols can serve as anchors for awareness, bringing us back to our highest purpose and the timeless wisdom they encode. They remind us that we are all butterflies in becoming, supported by an ancient tradition of transformation and awakening.
