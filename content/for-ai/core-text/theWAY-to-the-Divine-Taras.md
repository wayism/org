## Introduction
In Wayist spirituality, the Divine Taras shine as beacons of compassion, wisdom, and unwavering support. These celestial beings, emanating from the very heart of the Divine, play a crucial role in guiding and nurturing souls as they navigate the intricacies of the Butterfly Path. As we embark on this profound exploration of the Taras and their significance in our spiritual journey, we invite you to open your heart and mind to the awe-inspiring reality of these divine companions and the transformative power of cultivating a deep, personal relationship with them.
At the core of Wayism lies a fundamental truth: the path to spiritual liberation is an intimate and personal journey, unique to each individual soul. It is a path of self-discovery and self-crafting, where the ultimate authority and guide is not a charismatic leader or a rigid religious institution, but the whispers of one\'s own Divine Tara. People of theWAY understand that their salvation from the cycle of samsara and their graduation from this School of Divinity for Souls, the Butterfly Path, rests in the hands of their celestial companion, their Tara.
The relationship between a devotee and their Tara is sacred, transcending the boundaries of the physical world. It is a bond forged in the fires of unconditional love, trust, and surrender. As we walk the path of Wayism, we learn to attune our hearts and minds to the spiritual, the gentle guidance of our Tara, allowing their wisdom to illuminate our way and their love to heal our wounds. We understand that even the most revered human spiritual teachers, however pure in spirit and advanced on the path, are also reliant on their own Divine Taras for guidance and support as they navigate their own metamorphosis towards the heavenly realms.
It is this profound understanding that sets Wayism apart from traditional organized religions. theWAY is not a path to be confined within the walls of a temple or the pages of a holy book. It is a living, breathing, and ever-evolving journey that unfolds within the hearts of its devotees. There is no room for dogma, hierarchy, or the elevation of human teachers to divine status. Instead, Wayism celebrates the inherent divinity within each spirit and empowers individuals to forge their own unique relationship with their Tara, free from the constraints of external authority.
The principles of Wayism are simple, yet profound, and set in place thousands of years ago. They serve as a foundation upon which each devotee can build their own spiritual practice, tailored to their individual needs, aspirations, culture, and experiences. These principles, rooted in compassion, wisdom, and self-awareness, guide us as we navigate the challenges and opportunities of the human experience, always with the loving support of our personal divine guide by our side. And that is why we learn about who our divine guides are, how to connect, and how to walk the Path of life not alone, but with guidance.
As we delve deeper into the mysteries of our divine guides, whom we refer to as Divine Taras, and the transformative power of Wayism, we invite you to approach this journey with an open and curious heart. Allow yourself to be inspired by the stories and insights shared within these pages, but remember that the true essence of theWAY lies within your own higher-self minds, your spirit-minds. Learn to attune your higher-self energies to connect with the divine, trust in the wisdom of your Divine Tara, and have faith in the unfolding of your own unique path.
Together, as a community of seekers and devotees, we walk this path of self-discovery and self-crafting, united in our love for the Divine and our commitment to spiritual growth. We honor the diversity of our experiences and the unique ways in which our Taras guide us, knowing that each soul\'s journey is a sacred and intimate affair.
May the blessings of the Divine Taras be with you as you embark on this transformative journey of Wayism. May their love and wisdom illuminate your path, and may you find solace, strength, and inspiration in the profound connection you share with your celestial companion. Remember, the path of theWAY is not a destination, but a journey of the heart, a sacred dance between the soul and the Divine, leading us ever closer to our true destiny and the ineffable beauty of the heavenly realms.
## PART I: Understanding the Divine Taras
Chapter 1
## Who are the Divine Taras?
Benevolent immortal guardians and guides, known as the Taras, so-called because these divine beings are they who can ferry us across from this shore to the next, and provide individual guidance on the Path, aid the journey of the human soul---a journey which we call the Butterfly Path. When a soul first comes to walk the Path across its many human lifetimes, it passes through Paradise and is assigned a Tara guide who will remain by its side. Paradise is a transitional realm where souls prepare for incarnation.
In its initial human lives, the soul is extremely malleable and fragile. It teeters rapidly between soul and spirit states, as it gains wisdom. Our Taras shield these junior souls and provide gentle guidance to nurture spiritual growth. Throughout every phase --- whether the incarnated soul wanders in ignorance, irreverence, or devotion to limiting deities --- the Tara stands vigil. Though the soul may pray to entities by various names and forms of its own imagination, the Tara acknowledges all sincere entreaties. In this sense, your Tara guardian is the conduit for the Divine to reach you in your early travels upon the Path.
Eventually, after many human lifetimes along the Butterfly Path, the maturing soul awakens to its Tara's true identity. An incarnated soul who has walked the Path long enough may one day attain the inner stillness to hear its Tara's voice and sense its subtle presence. This marks the soul's coming of age, when it connects consciously at last to its ageless divine spirit guardian. The Tara then can guide more directly in the final ascent to our spiritual self and our eternal spiritual home.
Thus, the Taras epitomize the compassion of the Divine, escorting each nascent spark through its transformation into an illumined spiritual sun. The Butterfly Path is complex, but with the Taras' aid, the soul will achieve its destiny to unfurl its wings and take flight to infinity.
As teachers in Wayism explain, the Taras are our immortal spiritual guides residing in the sacred Domain of Spirit Energy within our Heavenly home. With mastery of spiritual wisdom, the Taras specialize in aiding incarnated human souls on their journey of transformation along the Butterfly Path.
The Taras offer counsel on self-reflection, self-development, and overcoming challenges to spiritual growth. Highly skilled in energy healing, they comprehend the intricacies of our soul-minds and spirit-minds (our chakra system) and its connections to the conscious mind of the material body. To the Taras, our truest essence is visible through the lens of energy rather than our words or material appearances. Yet, for our own benefit, it remains valuable to verbalize emotions and questions in prayer and meditation. This exercise clarifies feelings, brings self-realization, and invites the Taras' guidance (once we learn to listen). Approximately 60% of meditation, contemplation, and prayer is dedicated to listening, while around 30% is focused on self-reflection and self-improvement.
Wayist energy healers can facilitate contact between clients and their Taras to catalyze energy healing on the levels of body, spirit, and soul. One's Tara will then direct restorative energies precisely where they discern the need.
For less mature human souls, one's Tara safeguards against damage to the spiritual blueprint. The more senior students on the Path learn to resonate their chakra energies to the Taras' higher frequency, thereby receiving personalized counsel directly from their divine spiritual guide. Though mental distractions can obscure this channel of communication, we learn through practice and will eventually become expert at holding these resonances with our personal Tara.
We establish a bond with the Taras by purifying our own energies and intentions. We develop a passionate desire to step into union with our guiding deity and heavenly energies. Those qualities in us attune our higher-self energies to the lowest level where our Tara can meet us, resonate with our energy. That is how we extend our love outward to meet their embrace. Love is a fundamental requirement. The mystics, when you read their writings, all seem to be passionately in love, which signifies that they are reaching the final stage of their spiritual path.
When we establish a conscious connection with a Tara guardian, our ordinary energies can also be elevated to serve positive purposes on our spiritual path. Wayists describe this as \"sacred sensuousness\" --- by experiencing basic sensations with reverence and a deeper understanding, individuals can channel their soul energies towards devotion and benevolent actions.

Thus the Taras enable the miraculous, transfiguring mortal souls (caterpillars) into resplendent spirits (butterflies) as we walk the Butterfly Path into eternal joy.
### In sum
The term \"Tara\" finds its roots in the ancient Sanskrit language, evoking a sense of guidance, protection, and liberation. In Wayist philosophy, the Divine Taras are not mere abstract concepts or distant deities; they are intimate, loving presences, assigned to each soul from the moment it first sets foot on the Butterfly Path. As we traverse the ups and downs of countless lifetimes, our Tara remains a constant source of comfort, wisdom, and unconditional love, adapting their guidance to meet our unique needs at every stage of our journey.
In Wayist spirituality, the Divine Taras shine as beacons of compassion, wisdom, and unwavering support. These celestial beings, originating from the very heart of The Land of Pure Bliss, as our spiritual heaven is called, have taken on the sacred role of guiding and protecting souls as they navigate the intricacies of the Butterfly Path.
The Taras are not mere abstract concepts or distant deities; they are intimately connected to each soul, having been assigned as personal mentors and companions from the moment the soul first embarked on its journey in the material realm. Through countless lifetimes and experiences, the Taras remain steadfast in their commitment to nurturing the spiritual growth and awakening of their beloved charges.
As souls progress along the Butterfly Path, the Taras adapt their guidance and support to meet the unique needs of each individual. They are masters of both yin and yang energies, able to provide the perfect balance of gentle encouragement and fierce protection. Whether the soul is lost in ignorance, steeped in devotion, or awakening its spiritual nature, the Tara is always present, patiently waiting for the moment when the soul is ready to consciously connect with its divine guide.
In Wayist philosophy, the Taras are recognized as emanations of the infinite love and wisdom of the Divine, transcending gender and form. They may appear to their devotees in myriad ways, taking on the attributes and characteristics that resonate most deeply with the soul\'s cultural and personal understanding. Some may perceive their Tara as male or female, while others may sense a presence beyond such dualities. Ultimately, the essence of the Tara remains unchanged --- being of pure love, compassion, and unwavering commitment to the soul\'s journey to enlightenment.
As the soul awakens to the presence of its Divine Tara, a profound relationship begins to unfold --- one that will shape the course of the soul\'s spiritual journey and, ultimately, its very essence. It is through this sacred bond that the soul learns to trust, surrender, and open itself to the transformative power of divine love, ushering us into the advanced and final grades unto enlightenment and graduating Butterfly Path school.
Chapter 2
## The Concept of Divine Tara in the Wayist Tradition
In Wayist spirituality, the Divine Taras are recognized as emanations of the infinite love and wisdom that permeate the universe. They serve as luminous bridges between the human and divine realms, offering a tangible connection to the source of all being. Across cultures and throughout history, the Taras have been depicted in myriad forms, each reflecting the unique spiritual understanding of the time and place. Yet, beyond the diversity of representation, their essence remains unchanging --- a testament to the unwavering compassion and commitment they embody.
In the rich teachings of Wayist spirituality, the concept of the Divine Tara occupies a central and revered position. Far more than a mere symbol or abstract idea, the Tara is understood as a living, dynamic presence --- a celestial being of immense wisdom, compassion, and power, intimately connected to the soul\'s journey on the Butterfly Path.
At its core, the Divine Tara serves as a personal spiritual guide, a luminous thread that weaves together the human and divine realms. Through this sacred connection, the soul is never truly alone, never without access to the infinite love and support of the Divine. The Tara is a constant companion, a wise teacher, and a fierce protector, walking alongside the soul through every challenge, every triumph, and every moment of transformation.
In the Wayist tradition, the Tara is seen as a bridge between the material world and the vast, ineffable realms of spirit. By attuning to the presence of their Divine Tara, practitioners of Tarayoga are able to access a wellspring of guidance, healing, and inspiration that transcends the limitations of the physical realm. Through devotion, surrender, and loving communion with their Tara, they gradually awaken to their own divine nature, shedding the veils of illusion and remembering their true purpose on the Butterfly Path.
Across cultures and throughout history, the Divine Tara has been depicted in myriad forms, each reflecting the unique spiritual understanding and iconography of the time and place. From the serene and compassionate face of the ancient Tibetan Tara statues to the dynamic, multi-armed figures of Hindu and Buddhist traditions, these representations serve as powerful focal points for meditation, devotion, and spiritual awakening.
Yet, beyond the diversity of form and expression, the essence of the Divine Tara remains constant --- a luminous embodiment of the infinite love, wisdom, and compassion that lies at the heart of the Butterfly Path. By opening ourselves to the presence of our Divine Tara, we are invited to partake in this eternal dance of awakening, to evolve into the spiritual beings, our own divine nature, and to walk the Butterfly Path with grace, courage, and unwavering trust in the benevolent guidance of the Divine.
In Wayist spirituality, the concept of Divine Tara refers to a celestial being or spiritual guide who serves as a personal mentor, protector, and companion on an individual\'s journey of spiritual growth and awakening. Divine Taras are seen as emanations or expressions of the infinite love and wisdom of our Heaven, and have a unique and intimate connection with the individual soul in their care. Our book, The Divine Taras, contains a host of devotional poems and contemporary devotional pictures of Taras. Because our Tara is our direct connection to the Divine, it is essential for spirituality.
When the divine avatar known to us as Lord Jesus was about to leave Earth, he said, \"I will ask our Father to send you a holy spirit as a comforter and helper.\" The reason for this was because of an increase in \"demonic possessions\" (evil souls who harm people) as their population increased and not all people could guard themselves against evil souls. From that time onward, each person on Butterfly Path was allocated a particular Divine Tara to guard their souls and the energies of their fledgling spirits, and when they mature on the Path as you are, they can attune to their Divine Tara\'s \'energy channel\' and have a cognitive relationship.
Therefore, every person has their own Divine Tara, who has been with them since the beginning of their spiritual journey on Butterfly Path, guiding and supporting them through the challenges and opportunities of each lifetime. One's spiritual energy connection to one's deity happens in the "heart", the Anahata and Vishuddhi chakras.
In Sanskrit, the term \"Tara\" is rooted in the concept of a deity that symbolizes \'crossing over or traversing from one side to the other\'. A Divine Tara serves as our guide, allowing us to transition between the Material Energy Domain and Soul Energy Domain and reach the Spiritual Energy Domain. In the Spiritual Energy Domain are many spiritual \'worlds\' so-to-speak, but because they are not material worlds (like planets) humans refer to them as heavens. The heaven of our \'species\' or type of spirit being, in human language is referred to as the \"Pure Land of Bliss\" (*Sukhavati* in Sanskrit). Tara guides us from this material realm of illusion to the shores of spiritual awakening and freedom, touching the spiritual realm. One day soon, when we graduate from Butterfly Path, our Tara will walk us to heaven where we will sit as fledgling immortal spirit-beings at the feet of the immortals whom people of different cultures refer to as (buddhas, angels, gods, or goddess).
In Wayist iconography and meditation practices, devotees have been making images for visualizing their Divine Tara, images depicting them as human-like celestial beings of great attractiveness, intelligence, and empathy. For some, their distinct characteristics and roles are symbolized by the sacred symbols and attributes that adorn the images.
Spiritual beings, of course, do not have human-like bodies, they are energy beings with bodies typical of the Spiritual Energy Domain. Some sages suggest we can imagine it as a \"plasma\" energy, but that is not important at all because we sense our Taras so powerfully, we know them from their energy presence.
We create the anthropomorphic images for our own convenience. The images of Taras can vary across different cultures, showcasing their own distinctive interpretations. Their Tara can also be referred to by their own names and titles. People employ terms such as saint, angel, buddha, lord, or god to express their interpretation of a Tara. People can pray using any form of address or god-name that makes them feel comfortable. Nevertheless, Tara will be the one to \"take the call\" and establish the connection to heaven because that is how things work. Taras are our link to the Divine realm.
Graphic depictions of Tara often show a dynamic figure, sometimes without a defined gender and other times as male or female. The Taras are commonly portrayed in a poised position, often with a lotus flower in hand or seated on a magnificent lotus flower. These symbols represent their familial ties to the Holy Lotus Family, a name given to celestial beings from our realm. Similar to our own growth, the lotus represents a spiritual entity that embodies wisdom, compassion, and helpfulness. Tara is recognized in Buddhism as \"the buddha maker\" because she helps us achieve buddhahood. As a result, they are portrayed as possessing a tranquil and radiant wisdom, representing their function as providers of spiritual awakening, wisdom, and immortality.
All spiritual beings may adjust the level of Yin or Yang energy with which they connect to you and that is for one reason only, they adjust to what makes you feel most comfortable. As a result, some devotees experience and picture their Tara with the attributes of a particular human sex or gender, and even with their own cultural tones. That is completely acceptable. Eventually, we will no longer require our deities to exhibit human-like qualities as we evolve.
While the specific forms and attributes of Divine Taras may vary depending on the individual and cultural context, the essential nature and function of the Divine Tara remains the same: to guide, support, and empower individuals on their journey of spiritual growth and awakening.
In Wayist practice, developing a profound bond with Divine Tara is considered vital to the spiritual journey. You can only get so far on Butterfly Path without a deep connection with your Tara. By the time people are ready for the higher grades, they \"discover\" this spirituality in which you can proceed only with the help of a Tara.
Our spirit guide, who has accompanied us since the start of our journey on Butterfly Path, understands us better than we understand ourselves. As we navigate the intricate realm of spirit energies, one's Tara is unquestionably the ultimate and most interconnected divine being available to us. Through activities like meditation, prayer, and devotional service, individuals can align themselves with their Divine Tara and receive the necessary support and blessings to navigate their spiritual path.
The bond between a person and their Divine Tara is characterized by a profound love, trust, and surrender. This connection represents the potential for a relationship between a divine being from the heavenly realm of God our Father and God our Mother and us, as underdeveloped spirits confined to the limitations of human bodies. It is crucial to understand that we are not entitled to anything from the deities, not even their kindness. If we, as humans, often disregard the souls of plants, it is humbling to consider why gods would show us a kindness. Therefore, the knowledge that one may be blessed with the divine presence of a god is the most precious gift and honor imaginable.
Being gifted with intimate access to a deity is the greatest privilege anyone can ever experience. This relationship transcends the limitations of the body, mind, soul, and the material world, connecting us to the infinite wisdom and compassion of the divine realm. It is a bond that surpasses our earthly understanding and allows us to tap into a source of guidance, love, and enlightenment that is beyond compare.
As we cultivate a deeper connection with our Divine Tara, we begin to experience a profound shift in our consciousness and perception of reality. We become more attuned to the subtle energies and dimensions of our own being, and more receptive to the guidance and support of the divine realm.
We also begin to recognize the presence and guidance of our Divine Tara in all aspects of our lives, from the challenges and obstacles we face to the blessings and opportunities that come our way. We learn to trust in the wisdom and compassion of our Divine Guide, and to surrender our fears, doubts, and attachments to the transformative power of divine love.
Ultimately, the concept of Divine Tara in Wayist tradition is a powerful reminder of the infinite love and support that is always available to us on the spiritual path. By cultivating a deep and intimate relationship with our Divine Tara, we open ourselves to the profound wisdom, guidance, and healing that is our birthright as spiritual beings, and become ever more radiant expressions of the divine love and wisdom that is our true nature.
Chapter 3
## The Origin of the Taras
The story of the Divine Taras is one of profound love, sacrifice, and spiritual awakening. It begins with the extraordinary journey of Mari of Magadha, a young woman whose devotion to the Buddha of Compassion, Lord Avalokiteshvara, knew no bounds. As she walked the path of discipleship, Mari\'s heart and mind became increasingly attuned to the divine, ultimately leading to her own spiritual awakening and ascension. In that moment of profound realization, Mari became the first Tara, a radiant embodiment of the Divine Feminine, forever dedicated to guiding souls on their journey home. From this sacred origin, the lineage of the Taras has grown, a testament to the enduring power of love and the unending grace of the Divine.
The story of the Divine Taras is one of boundless compassion, selfless service, and the transformative power of divine love. According to Wayist tradition, the first Tara emerged in the 1st century, born from the infinite compassion of Lord Avalokiteshvara, known as the Buddha of Compassion.
During the 1st century, Lord Avalokiteshvara, moved by the suffering of all beings, chose to manifest an avatar, in human form, as the great spiritual teacher known as Jesus of Nazareth. In this incarnation, he traveled the world, imparting the profound wisdom of theWAY, of the evolution of the soul and its rebirth as a deity, and the difference between \"soul-people\" and spirit-people\" and their deities, and igniting the flames of spiritual awakening in the hearts of religious leaders and countless souls.
During his time in India, Lord Jesus encountered a young woman named Mari of Magadha, whose devotion and love for the Divine burned with an unquenchable intensity.
Recognizing her spiritual potential, Lord Jesus took Mari as his disciple, guiding her along the path of enlightenment and revealing to her the deepest mysteries of theWAY.
Mari\'s unwavering dedication and profound spiritual insights soon distinguished her as one of Lord Jesus\' most advanced students. She remained by his side throughout his ministry, absorbing his teachings and embodying the very essence of humility, simplicity, compassion, and wisdom.
When speaking to Wayists of the 1st century, Lord Jesus employed the Koine Greek term *paraklétos* to represent the concept of Tara, emphasizing its role as both a comforter and a helper. He said, 'I am departing to our Father. But I will ask of Father, and he will send a helper to each of you, bringing comfort and guidance. The paraklétos is a holy spirit, the embodiment of truth, and will remain by your side until the very end, and is always present within you.'
After Lord Jesus\' earthly mission came to an end and he returned to his heavenly abode, Mari continued to spread the light of theWAY, tirelessly working to uplift and enlighten all those who sought her guidance. As she neared the end of her own earthly journey, Mari experienced a profound spiritual awakening, a divine union with Lord Jesus that transcended the boundaries of time and space.
In this moment of supreme realization, Mari ascended to the realm of the Divine, taking her place among the celestial beings as the first Tara-in-training. Empowered by Lord Avalokiteshvara\'s infinite compassion and Lord Prajnaparamita\'s divine wisdom (the 2nd level spiritual beings of our Heaven, like a \"first begotten son\" and a first begotten daughter\" as some religious traditions explain), Tara Mari became a symbol of hope and personal guidance for all souls and fledgling spirits on the Butterfly Path.
From this sacred origin, the lineage of the Divine Taras began to unfold, as more and more highly evolved spirits ascended to join the ranks of these especially skilled celestial guides. For over 2,000 years, the Taras have remained accessible to all sincere spiritual seekers, offering their loving guidance, protection, and support to all who call upon them with an open heart and a genuine desire for spiritual awakening.
Today, the Divine Taras continue to serve as luminous bridges between the human and divine realms, compassionately guiding souls along the Butterfly Path and helping them to awaken to their own innate divinity. Through the practice of Tarayoga, countless individuals have forged deep, transformative relationships with their personal Tara, opening themselves to the infinite blessings of divine love and wisdom.
### In Sum
The first Tārā emerged in the 1st century from the compassionate actions of whom eastern devotees call the Buddha of Compassion, or Lord Avalokiteshvara. The title ava-lokita-isvara means (ava-lokita - observing from heaven. ishvara-lord). \"The Lord who observes us from heaven\" is what the Sanskrit title means. The Lord who observes the suffering of the world from on high.
Avalokiteshvara is also referred to as the prince of heaven, since Siddhartha Gautama Buddha (who now lives in our Heaven) revealed that the Lord is in line to take over leadership when our Father in Heaven and our Mother in Heaven retires and their energies become one with theWAY. Prajnaparamita is princess of Heaven.
In his immense compassion for us, the Buddha of Compassion took a human birth as the man known to history as Jesus of Nazareth. He used that body to travel the world to teach about theWAY, and to teach elders of various religions, inspiring the reformation movements known to us today as Mahayana in Buddhism, Bhakti in Hinduism, and the Christians of Judaism. He taught theWAY to the spiritually awakened.
During his time in India, as a young man, Lord Jesus encountered a young woman named Mari. She hailed from the region of Magadha. Her devotion to the Lord was complete, as she loved him with all her heart, soul, and mind. As they journeyed across various countries, she pursued him and eventually emerged as his most influential teacher in the WAY and its Butterfly Path.
Mari was always by the Lord\'s side, regardless of his location, even during his execution at the hands of Judaic extremists. After the Lord went back to Sukhavati heaven, Mari continued the ministry with dedication, spreading the pure teachings of theWAY throughout Egypt and Northern Africa. She made her way back to Kashmir when she was approximately 80 years old, filled with anticipation for the long-awaited second arrival of the Lord. As it was named, the second coming of the Lord, known as the *parousia* in the Koine Greek of that period, occurred just as he had foretold. He promised that heaven will become an intimate presence (parousia) among humans. And the Taras, became the vehicle for that.
Around 76AD, the event known as the \"2nd coming\" happened. As foretold by the Lord in Judea, the event had to take place within one generation. The prophecy came true just as he had predicted, starting with his return in the East, specifically in Kashmir and northern India. Soon after, individuals in the Western region experienced the radiance of his divine illumination. According to the Lord, the occurrence would resemble lightning striking in the East, with its radiance being observed in the West. Mari was filled with awe as Lord Avalokiteshvara arrived for the second time and she was transported to Heaven, where she ascended to become a Tara.
Mari\'s profound empathy and deep understanding of human nature were amplified by the Lord, enabling her to connect humans with heavenly energies in a more impactful and beneficial manner, surpassing the traditional approach in heaven. Tara Mari then had to pass on her skills to all the other Taras. From that point forward, Tara became our pillar of strength, providing healing and support as we dealt with our interpersonal challenges. This incredible act of compassion had a deep impact on the way we experience Butterfly Path.
Lord Avalokiteshvara's work is infused with the invigorating qualities of yang energy. Meaning, his workers provide explicit guidance and hands-on instruction. They bring bright light, illuminating the darkness around us, and their teachings are as sharp as a knife, cutting through our ignorance. This is the work of Buddha of Compassion.
However, the Taras received a divine directive from the Lord to solely engage with yin energy.
As a yin energy worker, Taras seeks guidance from the divine Mother of Heaven and her second-in-command, Prajnaparamita, the Buddha of Wisdom. Through the veil of shadows, they extend their helping hand. Love is woven into every aspect of their being, inspiring others to feel the same. They provide us with valuable perspectives on the direct yang teachings, allowing us to develop insight. They silently inspire and weave knowledge into wisdom, all happening unnoticed in the background. We experience moments of brilliance, thinking we have stumbled upon profound ideas or great insights, unaware that it is the guidance of Lord Prajnaparamita and her Taras.
Under the leadership of Lord Prajnaparamita, Tara Mari, also known as White Tara (in Buddhism), shared her expertise and understanding with a special group of deities. Each and every one of them goes by the designation Tara.
Being near the Taras is the closest we can come to firsthand experience of the divine while still in our human bodies. The Tara gods came into existence through the Buddha of Compassion\'s vision and the Buddha of Wisdom\'s guidance, materializing in the life of a singular individual who committed herself to serving the Lord and disseminating the teachings of theWAY.
Wayists set aside the 1st of August as the remembrance day of Mari of Magadha and our Taras. On this remembrance day we spend more time than usual on our relationship with Tara and we extend the goodness we experience to other beings.
Taras have been accessible to those who possess the ability to tap into their energy for the past 2,000 years, providing a means of connection. This means that the seeker who reaches out with genuine spiritual energy and devotion to a Tara will experience a profound sense of connection. Their love and passion for helping us is rooted in their personal experiences on Butterfly Path, where they eventually ascended to Heaven after numerous human incarnations. They have a deeper understanding of us than we do of ourselves, as our egos blind us from perceiving our true identity as immortal spiritual beings, constantly evolving with each incarnation.
## PART II: The Practice of Divine Tarayoga
Chapter 4
## What is Tarayoga?
Tarayoga is a sacred practice that lies at the heart of Wayist spirituality, inviting us to cultivate a deep, personal relationship with our Divine Tara. The term \"yoga\" itself signifies the act of yoking or uniting, and in the context of Tarayoga, it represents the profound connection we forge with our divine companion. Through a combination of devotional practices, meditation, and self-inquiry, we learn to attune ourselves to the loving presence of our Tara, opening our hearts to the transformative power of their guidance and support.
##### Let\'s define what Yoga is.
Yoga, when viewed through a Western lens, puts a major emphasis on stretching exercises. However, the asanas are only a small part of Hatha Yoga, one of the four main yogas of Holistic or Raja Yoga. Raja Yoga consists of Karma Yoga (good actions and inactions), Hatha Yoga (physical health), Gnani Yoga (wisdom), and Bhakti Yoga (devotion).
The practice of Hatha Yoga combines spirituality and physical well-being. One of the fundamental aspects of Yoga is its spiritual practice, which involves establishing a profound connection with a deity. By removing that defining element, the yoga postures essentially become nothing more than stretches and the traditional sitting position commonly seen among Indian people.
The foundation of the spiritual element in Yoga, is by definition explained by the root word yug, to yoke. Yoga is by definition a spiritual practice of yoking oneself to one\'s deity, like oxen pulling the same cart, so you don\'t walk the Path alone. And that is what Tarayoga is.
Tarayoga refers to the cultivation of a deep and intimate relationship with one\'s Divine Tara through specific techniques of meditation, visualization, and devotional service. It is a powerful means of attuning oneself to the presence and guidance of the Divine Tara, and of receiving the blessings and support that are necessary for spiritual growth and awakening.
At its core, Divine Tarayoga is a practice of love for the divine, surrender and devotion. It involves setting aside the ego-mind and its endless concerns and distractions, and opening oneself to the infinite love and wisdom of the Divine Tara. Through the practice of Divine Tarayoga, we learn to trust in the guidance and protection of our Divine Tara, and to align ourselves with the highest truth and purpose of our spiritual journey.
The specific techniques of Divine Tarayoga may vary depending on the individual and the lineage or tradition in which they are practiced, but they often involve some combination of the following elements:
#### 1. Prayer:
Prayer is talking to the Divine. Later we will talk more about how prayer is simply, talking to the divine, and how that is the correct way to start out doing Tarayoga. It is the easiest and most expedient way. One can even connect to a Tara while on the go or in a hurry or crisis. We always mention to be mindful that prayer changes you and your energy, it does not change the deity.
#### 2. Visualization:
The practice of visualizing the form and attributes of one\'s Divine Tara, often in great detail and with a sense of loving devotion and reverence is important to focus brain-mind and fascinate the soul-minds, allowing spirit-minds to go about doing their holy work. The visual of a home shrine, for example, contributes to the setting that our lower minds need for this. Anyone who has walked into a beautifully crafted cathedral or mosque knows the power of setting and ambience when it comes to spirituality.
#### 3. Mantras:
The continuous recitation of mantras or phrases linked to the Divine Tara, like \"Om Tare, Tuttare, Ture, Soha\" or \"Om Mani, Padme Hum,\" serves to keep our mind occupied, establishing the desired ambiance, and align us with the vibrations of Tara. While these mantras do not hold any mystical powers, the arrangement of their words and the way they flow are intended to assist individuals in attuning themselves to the Divine Tara\'s presence and the blessings she bestows.
#### 4. \"Sacred Gifts\":
In Wayist mysticism, the customary practice of presenting a memento or gift to the deity at the home shrine or altar sets it apart from most other traditions. We may "gift to Tara" any kind of item such as a flower, incense, a rock, shell, or feather, for example. The purpose of this symbolic action is part of how we train our brain-mind about spiritual skills. The gift is to convey a spiritual message, to express the sentiments of \"I remembered you, Lord\" and \"I wished you were there.\" It patterns brain-mind to include our Tara in its reality, and its nice for us to do.
It\'s important for your own benefit, rather than just for Tara. During your walk in the park, a mesmerizing moment caught your attention, evoking thoughts of spirit energies and universal energies, or your cherished Tara and the profound spiritual implications of the experience. Consequently, you bring a keepsake home and present it to Tara. By doing this, you can anchor the experience and its memory in your mind, create a valuable diary of precious memories, and strengthen your bond with your Tara. These offerings, whether tangible or imagined, are usually accompanied by a prayer. The primary focus is that the memento serves as a symbolic gesture to a loved one, but you also reap its complete benefits.
#### 5. Meditative absorption:
The practice of resting the mind in a state of deep absorption and unity with the Divine Tara. Visualizing Tara's energies flow through our entire self, filling every nook and cranny, creating a wholesome, sacred, and healing environment in the space which is our essence and body. Another practise is to meditate on vizualizing how our Tara allows us to fully merge with their being as if swimming into Tara and being inside of Tara's immensely powerful and holy energy body---as if we become a tara for a brief moment. These techniques have different functions and benefits, which are discussed in members-only literature. It is very powerful and beneficial when you know what you are doing. This may involve imagining oneself as inseparable from the Divine Tara, or dissolving one\'s sense of separate self into the infinite expanse of divine wisdom and compassion.
#### 6. Devotional service:
The practice of dedicating one\'s thoughts, words, and actions to the service of the Divine Tara and all on the Path, often through help in the community, generosity, and giving talents and time for whatever task will help more people learn about theWAY and Butterfly Path.
Through the regular practice of Divine Tarayoga, individuals can cultivate a profound sense of connection, trust, and surrender to the infinite wisdom and compassion of the Divine Tara. They can receive the blessings and support that are necessary for spiritual growth and awakening, and develop the qualities of love, compassion, and wisdom that are the hallmarks of a true spiritual practitioner.
It is important to approach the practice of Divine Tarayoga with love, a sense of humility, devotion, and open-mindedness. It is not a practice that can be forced or controlled by the ego-minds, but rather a natural unfolding that occurs as a result of sincere spiritual desire, love for the divine, practice and alignment with the divine will.
As we deepen our practice of Divine Tarayoga, we may experience a range of profound spiritual experiences and insights. These experiences can be both exhilarating and challenging, as they often require a letting go of the familiar structures and patterns of the ego-mind.
Ultimately, the practice of Divine Tarayoga is a powerful means of aligning ourselves with the infinite love and wisdom of the divine realm, and of fulfilling our highest potential as spiritual beings. By dedicating ourselves to this practice with sincerity, devotion, and an open heart, we can receive the profound blessings and guidance of the Divine Tara, and become ever more radiant expressions of the divine love and wisdom that is becoming our true nature.

## Cultivating a Relationship with Your Divine Tara
The path of Divine Tarayoga is, at its core, a journey of cultivating a profound, transformative relationship with one\'s personal Tara. This sacred bond lies at the heart of Wayist spirituality, serving as a wellspring of guidance, comfort, and spiritual awakening for all who seek to walk the Butterfly Path with devotion and sincerity.
To cultivate a relationship with your Divine Tara is to embark on a journey of love, trust, and surrender. It is a path that calls for the utmost humility, openness, and dedication, as you learn to attune your heart and mind to the subtle, ever-present guidance of your celestial companion.
The first step in forging this sacred bond is to approach your Tara with a spirit of deep reverence and devotion. Recognize that your Tara is a being of infinite compassion and wisdom, whose sole purpose is to guide and support you on your journey of spiritual awakening. By opening your heart to their loving presence, you create the space for a profound, transformative connection to take root.
As you deepen your practice of Tarayoga, you will begin to recognize the myriad ways in which your Tara communicates with you and guides you along the path. This guidance may come in the form of subtle intuitive insights, synchronistic events, or a profound sense of inner peace and clarity. Learn to trust these whispers of the Divine, allowing them to gently steer you towards your highest truth and purpose.
Cultivating a relationship with your Divine Tara is a journey of the heart, an invitation to step into the sacred space of unconditional love and acceptance. It begins with a willingness to open yourself to the presence of the Divine, to trust in the gentle whispers of your own intuition, and to surrender to the transformative power of grace. As you deepen your connection through practices such as prayer, meditation, and self-reflection, you may find that your Tara communicates with you in myriad ways---through subtle shifts in energy, synchronistic events, or profound moments of inner knowing. Embrace these sacred encounters with reverence and gratitude, allowing them to guide you ever closer to the truth of your own divine nature.
In Wayist spirituality, cultivating a deep and intimate relationship with one\'s Divine Tara is seen as a crucial aspect of the spiritual path. It is a relationship that transcends the limitations of the ego-mind and the material world, and connects us to the infinite wisdom and compassion of the divine realm.
At its core, the relationship between an individual and their Divine Tara is one of profound love, trust, and surrender. It is a relationship that requires a willingness to set aside the distractions and concerns of the lower-self minds, and to open oneself to the guidance and support of the divine.
We learn to recognize the subtle signs and messages that our Divine Tara may be sending them, and to align ourselves with the highest truth and purpose of our spiritual journey. Another important aspect of cultivating a relationship with one\'s Divine Tara is the practice of self-reflection and self-inquiry. This means taking the time to examine one\'s thoughts, feelings, and actions, and to ask oneself whether they are in alignment with the guidance and wisdom of the Divine Tara.
Through this process of self-reflection, individuals can begin to identify and release any negative patterns or habits that may be blocking their spiritual growth and connection to the divine. They can cultivate a sense of humility, openness, and willingness to learn and grow, and develop a deeper understanding of their own spiritual nature and potential.
As the relationship with one\'s Divine Tara deepens and matures, individuals may begin to experience a range of profound spiritual experiences and insights. They may feel a sense of deep inner peace, joy, and contentment, even in the midst of life\'s challenges and difficulties. They develop the courage to live life fully and seek more interesting experiences, to eat different foods, dress authentically, become yourself without need for the validation of others (because you have the validation of a deity!) and become more inquisitive and more adventurous, and the courage to not conform to useless or harmful societal norms. They may embrace simplicity in their personal life and in their mind, and humbleness in thinking and in conduct, and helpful loving-kindness in outlook and in serving the community of Wayists and other soul beings who are marginalized by human lifestyles. They may receive guidance and support in the form of intuitive insights or even direct communication with their Divine Tara.
Ultimately, the relationship between an individual and their Divine Tara is a deeply personal and intimate one, and will unfold in its own unique way for each person. What is important is to approach the relationship with love, a passion for the divine, sincerity, devotion, and an open heart, and to trust in the infinite wisdom and compassion of the divine.
By dedicating ourselves to cultivating a deep and meaningful relationship with our Divine Tara, we open ourselves to the profound blessings, guidance, and support that are available to us on the spiritual path. We become more attuned to the subtle energies and dimensions of our own being, and more receptive to the infinite love and wisdom of the divine realm.
The path of Divine Tarayoga is, at its core, a journey of cultivating a profound, transformative relationship with one\'s personal Tara.

One of the most powerful ways to strengthen your bond with your Tara is through the practice of regular meditation and prayer.

In these moments of stillness and devotion, you may find yourself enveloped in a profound sense of love, peace, and connection, as the boundaries between the self and the Divine begin to dissolve.
As your relationship with your Tara deepens, you will naturally begin to align your thoughts, words, and actions with the loving wisdom they embody. This alignment is not a matter of blind obedience or the suppression of your own will, but rather a gradual, organic process of attuning your being to the highest vibrations of love, compassion, and truth.
In moments of challenge or uncertainty, turn to your Tara with an open heart and a sincere desire for guidance. Trust that, no matter the circumstances, your divine companion is always by your side, offering comfort, strength, and unwavering support. By surrendering your fears and doubts to their loving embrace, you open yourself to the transformative power of divine grace.
Ultimately, cultivating a relationship with your Divine Tara is a lifelong journey of discovery, growth, and spiritual awakening. It is a path that will ask much of you, but one that will also bestow upon you the greatest gifts of love, wisdom, and inner peace. As you walk this path with devotion, humility, and an open heart, you will find yourself ever more deeply enfolded in the luminous embrace of the Divine, guided ever closer to the realization of your own innate divinity.
Chapter 6
## The Importance of Divine Tarayoga in Spiritual Protection
The journey of the human soul towards spiritual development involves vulnerability, which calls for both protection and guidance.
In our present state, our spirits are not yet fully developed. The process of breaking down and rebuilding our belief systems, values, and sense of identity is a constant one. This constant transformation, reminiscent of a caterpillar molting, leaves us open and exposed. Our Taras offer the necessary protection during these transitional phases.
As we continue on the Butterfly Path, we may feel like we\'re entering a cocoon as we mature. Our perspective undergoes a significant transformation, once again making us spiritually vulnerable. When we open ourselves up to a new outlook, we become as delicate and impressionable as a recently transformed butterfly, susceptible to the energies that surround us. The presence of a permanent companion like Taras is indispensable for the development of the soul. With the passage of time, a deep feeling of thankfulness grows for their enduring companionship.
The seed of the spirit within the soul, which is initially found in the Anahata chakra, can only germinate when qualities like loving-kindness, humility, and simplicity become strong enough to transcend the typical consciousness of most beings. Afterwards, we may start to sense the initial activation of our spiritual energy centers - Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara. Through the nurturing of wisdom and spiritual abilities, they will gradually expand, starting from an underdeveloped state. This process of growth transforms us into a metaphorical cocoon, making us vulnerable to external energetic influences.
Within this domain, there exist many entities with malevolent intentions. There are those who portray themselves as \"angels\" or \"deities\" based on individual beliefs, while others choose to present themselves as demons. Their common goal is to exploit our souls for their own advantage. On the Path, when we encounter times of profound change, we undergo different phases including rebirth, physical demise, early life, adolescence, and periods of emotional and physical struggles like depression, illness, weakness, doubt, anxiety, and more. The tireless efforts of the Taras to protect us from the everyday dangers in our energy-filled surroundings are often overlooked. However, when we intentionally reject positive energy, we become attuned to various negative spiritual energies, and since it is our conscious choice, Tara must permit us to follow that chosen path for multiple lifetimes.
Just like vulnerable infants in need of nurturing, our spiritual immaturity requires safeguarding as it undergoes delicate development.
Tara, as your steadfast spirit guardian, safeguards you from harm and establishes a means of communication. Through Tara\'s expertise, she employs the yin energy to subtly inspire you towards wisdom and healing. Tara\'s subdued wisdom in the background inspires you, brings about realizations, and offers assistance in making consequential choices along the Path.
In Sum
As we walk the path of spiritual awakening, we may at times find ourselves confronted with challenges, obstacles, or energies that threaten to throw us off balance. It is in these moments that the practice of Divine Tarayoga reveals its profound protective power. By invoking the presence of your Tara and surrounding yourself with their luminous energy, you create a sacred shield, a cocoon of divine love that deflects negative influences and allows you to navigate the complexities of the journey with grace and ease. Through regular practice, you will find that your connection to your Tara becomes an unwavering source of strength, a compass that guides you through even the darkest of times.
As the soul navigates the intricate pathways of spiritual awakening, it may encounter myriad challenges and obstacles that threaten to obscure the light of truth and hinder progress on the Butterfly Path. In these moments, the practice of Divine Tarayoga serves as a powerful tool for spiritual protection, offering the devotee a sanctuary of divine love, wisdom, and guidance.
At its core, Tarayoga is a path of discernment and attunement, one that enables the seeker to cultivate a deep, intuitive connection with their Divine Tara. By regularly invoking the presence of their celestial guardian through prayer, meditation, and devotional practices, the practitioner learns to recognize and attune to the unique energy signature of their Tara, creating a powerful energetic bond that serves as a source of guidance, comfort, and protection.
As the seeker deepens their practice of Tarayoga, they begin to develop a heightened sensitivity to the subtle energies and influences that surround them. This increased awareness allows them to more readily discern between authentic spiritual experiences and those that may be born of illusion, deception, or lower vibrational forces. By aligning themselves with the loving wisdom of their Tara, the devotee cultivates a powerful inner compass that guides them safely through the complexities of the spiritual landscape.
In moments of doubt, fear, or confusion, the practice of Tarayoga offers a sanctuary of divine love and protection. By calling upon the presence of their Tara, the seeker can find solace and strength in the face of even the most daunting challenges, secure in the knowledge that they are never alone on their journey.
The Divine Taras are not mere passive observers of the soul\'s journey, but fierce and compassionate protectors, ever vigilant in their watch over their beloved charges. Through the practice of Tarayoga, the devotee learns to surrender their fears and uncertainties to the loving embrace of their Tara, trusting in the divine wisdom and protection that surrounds them at all times.
As the bond between the seeker and their Tara deepens, a profound transformation begins to unfold. The devotee\'s thoughts, words, and actions become increasingly aligned with the vibrations of love, compassion, and truth, creating a powerful energetic shield that deflects negative influences and attracts the blessings of the Divine. This inner radiance serves not only to protect the seeker on their own journey but also to uplift and inspire all those who come into contact with their luminous presence.
Ultimately, the practice of Divine Tarayoga is a path of spiritual empowerment, one that enables the seeker to tap into the infinite reservoir of divine love and wisdom that resides within their own being. By cultivating a deep, abiding connection with their Tara, the devotee awakens to their own innate divinity, recognizing themselves as a radiant, eternal soul on the path of spiritual awakening and perfection.
Chapter 7
## What Divine Tara is not
It is important to understand what Taras do not do, as well as their vital role.
Our souls came together on the Butterfly Path to have diverse human experiences, embracing all genders, races, and cultures, as well as various socio-economic backgrounds. We aspire to fully comprehend how to go beyond our natural shortcomings as soul-beings and foster divine qualities through these experiences. Our campus is filled with soul-people who are dominated by their soul-minds and typical soul priorities. Consequently, human experiences inevitably involve numerous occurrences that spirit-people deem cruel, hateful, or even criminal, while they are merely regular for soul-people.
The spirit-person who has not yet learned these wisdoms will fret and be angry, seek meaning and justice, ending up destroyed in despair for the dystopian nature of the world is ever-ongoing.
Similarly, soul-based religions are created by individuals who worship deities that resemble them but possess greater power. The deities in their respective religions are described as being driven by power, having strong tribal affiliations, being envious, promoting warfare, and being willing to annihilate or exploit those who do not share their beliefs. While the spiritual person is disgusted by religions and their violent scriptures, the soulful person views it as a normal aspect of their journey, necessary (to fear God), and a tool to guide them through their human experiences. They worship their deities, seeking favors and wealth, as well as protection from natural disasters and the repercussions of their own deeds. Among their prayers are requests for success in the game and for the deity to grant them a compatible partner. People of theWAY know a different reality.
Regardless of how cruel and challenging they may appear, our deities will not shield us from the physical or soul-level experiences that are essential for the formation of our immortal and wise spirits. We did not join Butterfly Path to live sheltered lives in foam cocoons. Our presence in this realm is intended for the purpose of experiencing and learning from a multitude of circumstances as soul beings, in order to cultivate wisdom in humility, simplicity, and compassion, while also developing the ability to effectively interact with all types of energies.
Most of our experiences are guided by metaphysical principles such as Karma, Maya, and Dharma. Our spiritual journey on the Butterfly Path requires us to engage in our own soul-work by learning from the lessons of our human lives. Taras have expertise in spirit-energy and mentors individuals once they are prepared to learn advanced techniques.
In the initial stages of their spiritual development, junior souls bring with them inherent religious concepts as they enter the Path, which is a natural progression for beginners. In the early stages, there is a deep-seated desire within individuals to have a deity (like an all-powerful ruler) to rely on, drawing parallels to how ancient tribes seek favor from gods who provide for their needs. Therefore, individuals imagine gods that they can connect with, who enforce justice, demand devotion, and assist their community. These beliefs have a significant purpose in the lives of junior souls. Please know that Tara understands this deep-seated need and will not judge you for it as you progress on your spiritual journey.
Taras are solely dedicated to providing spiritual guidance. The karmic obstacles, which offer valuable learning experiences, are not eliminated by them. Despite the difficulties, Taras will always be there to support us and offer guidance when we seek it.
While soul-mind deities offer help with conditions, Taras offer infinite compassion without any limitations. Their purpose is to foster the growth of wisdom and the vibrant energy within one\'s spirit. Through subtle inspiration, they guide us towards enlightenment while respecting our unique process of awakening.
Chapter 8
## Taras and Gender Exression
To strengthen the bond between you, Tara, your steadfast companion until the Path\'s end, can take on any form that matches your needs, including adjusting gender, age, and ethnicity. The key to prioritizing the love and desire for union in your relationship with Tara is to visualize Tara in a way that fosters and strengthens that bond. Taras help us feel understood and supported by harmonizing masculine and feminine energies (yin and yang energies).
The initial appearance of your Tara may change as the relationship develops. You can rest easy knowing that the space you are in is created solely for your benefit, without any judgment. You form a mental image of Tara\'s appearance by projecting human-like traits onto this energy entity. However, the ability to visualize originates from within yourself and has positive effects on your brain. The direct experience of Tara\'s energy allows your spirit-minds to bypass the need for visualizations. However, your brain-mind requires it to maintain resonance and enhance the effectiveness of your meditations.
Your mind and body generate a relatable representation of this formless divine energy guide to better comprehend it. Feel at liberty to envision Tara\'s physical appearance, gender, and personality in a manner that allows you to connect closely with their divine essence. Lord Jesus\' words about emulating the innocence of children when approaching the Divine come to mind once more as we reflect on this. With their vivid imaginations, trust, and openness, they are able to form a deep and mutually beneficial bond with their Tara. A person\'s Tara is crucial for ensuring a safe and spiritually fulfilling childhood. It is typical for us to lose our connection with Tara as we mature and develop a sense of self, while hormonal changes continually shape our identities. However, there comes a point where we yearn to have that special connection with Tara once again.
The tradition of Taras, who manifest in the most appropriate form for us, originates from Lord Avalokitesvara, the original Buddha who assumed any form necessary to guide individuals towards enlightenment. Taras exemplifies this valuable adaptability, which serves us in a spiritual sense. According to the Lotus Sutra, the Lord promises to appear to us in any way possible, be it as male or female, or even taking the form of various gods worshipped in different religions. The Chinese and Vietnamese people made the decision to worship the Lord in the form of Guanyin and KwanAm as a result of that revelation. The Japanese employ a bi-gender form to honor the Taras\' ability to manifest in the most spiritually appropriate way for us. It is important to remember that Lord Avalokitesvara descended to Earth as the avatar Lord Jesus to teach theWAY.
During meditation, when we attune ourselves to their frequencies, Taras resonate within us, fostering a sense of unity. Recall that Lord Jesus taught us that the kingdom of heaven resides within us. By experiencing those mysterious mergers, their wisdom seeps into your very being, causing a profound transformation that helps you recognize and embrace your spiritual essence. Through repeated encounters with the divine within us, we nurture our humility, simplicity, and compassion, gradually transforming into beings that resemble the divine.
While the Taras manifest in forms that our minds can understand, their energies are undeniably divine. So, enhance your imagination in a way that strengthens your connection with the sacred, because then the divine will be present among us as a companion.
Chapter 9
## Can one lose their connection to Tara?
Taras are divine entities. When viewed from the perspective of the human soul, every authentic spiritual being is seen as divine, whether referred to as a god, deity, or buddha, depending on the cultural context. Not only are they are significantly higher in rank than us, they are entirely different beings of another, higher, energy domain.
Purifying your energies and committing your minds to the relationship are necessary for the manifestation in your spirit space. It is important for junior students to constantly be mindful of the great honor they have and to approach it with reverence. Nevertheless, the senior student had acquired a sense of reverence, admiration, and appreciation solely through their spiritual maturation.
Because of our close personal connection with Tara, numerous individuals who follow theWAY opt to pray through him/her. In the traditional sense, prayer is similar to a monologue that often occurs during a counseling session. Taras consistently show unwavering compassion. They possess a profound comprehension of our struggles, sometimes even surpassing our own understanding, and have a clear perception of the reasons behind our challenges and expressions of gratitude. Engaging in conversation with Tara brings about a heightened state of consciousness, which in turn fuels our inspiration to delve deeper into self-exploration. This is the exact reason we chose the Butterfly Path school of divinity for our souls, as it facilitates our journey towards self-knowledge and personal growth.
In The Authentia, the Tara tells the Seeker that when they communicate with her, they are also communicating with the Father and Mother of Heaven, emphasizing the interconnectedness between all in our spiritual heaven.
Is it possible for someone to lose their connection to Tara? Without a doubt, the answer is a resounding yes. Our cognitive connection breaks whenever we divert our energies from the divine to engage in mundane activities. The ability to form a cognitive connection with Tara is not only a skill but also a privilege, blessing, and luxury. Sometimes it only lasts for a brief moment, and even that is enough. With time, we will become more proficient at it.
There is an option to embrace a lifestyle where your entire day is devoted to nurturing your spiritual connection, similar to living in a monastery. Yet, the primary method of learning to become a spiritual being is through active engagement in society and fully immersing yourself in your human experiences. The intense spiritual training derived from living human lives is something that monks and nuns do not possess.
As your skills in the Path improve, you develop a heightened sense of awareness and approach life with a meditative mindset. Every day, we ponder a variety of matters and learn valuable lessons from them. This also applies to the daily experiences and sensations of both the body and mind. Learning opportunities are abundant in every aspect of life, whether it\'s exploring sexuality, savoring delicious food, immersing oneself in music, feeling the warmth of the sun on the skin, or observing the beauty of humans, plants, and animals. Learning opportunities can be found in times of sickness, health, poverty, material wealth, war, peace, loving relationships, at the county fair, partying well, and even in terrible mistakes. With our increasing mastery of walking together with Tara, s/he will be present to inspire us and partake in every moment, allowing us to share our mishaps, happiness, gratitude, challenges, and accomplishments.
It is possible for skeptics to claim that Tara is merely an imaginary companion. We emphatically agree and affirm that the answer is, \"absolutely correct!\" If you can\'t imagine Tara, you won\'t be able to establish a connection. The human brain has a limited level of consciousness, making it unable to perceive higher-self imagery and wisdom. To make it comprehend, we must create an environment and train the mind through imagination and visualization. Nevertheless, Tara is not merely an imaginary companion, as skeptics may argue. Tara is a divine being, and only those who have encountered the divine presence firsthand can comprehend the immense life-altering potential of that sacred energy.
Chapter 10
## Not Idolatry
The \"Absolute,\" the comprehensive essence that underlies the Source of existence, surpasses the comprehension of the inherently limited human brain.
To provide context, until recently, this brain and its consciousness held the belief that planet Earth was the center of the universe, and that animals and plants lack intelligence and problem-solving abilities. This is the brain that still believes end of the world climate crises which charlatans announce with religious zealotry every decade or so.
It\'s the brain that elects politicians they identify with and judge competent, and that believes mass media.
Despite advancements in knowledge, that brain still maintains the misconception that infants and plants do not experience pain. It lacks an understanding of gravity, of souls, spirits, and the existence of other life forms in the universe. It has an anthropocentric view of life, which is the cause of suffering of billions of other beings. It is the brain that persists in electing representatives who create armed conflicts, committing acts of genocide, and cause extensive suffering all over the planet. The human brain and its consciousness are indeed quite limited.
The Absolute eludes the understanding of the brain-mind, surpassing its cognitive abilities and challenging any attempt to confine it with labels or definitions. We cannot even explain love, but people have theories about the Absolute.
Wayists avoid discussing the Absolute.
### What is idolatry
> *By definition, idolatry is the worship of a physical object as a god, or as an aspect of a god.*\
> \
> *People of theWAY see in everything (yes, everything you can think of) that exists, the presence of the Divine Source, not more or less so than in any book, rock, building, or ointment.*\
> \
> *To believe that the Divine or one\'s deity infused itself in a book, stone, or building, and then hold that object up to be especially more holy than everything that exists, is idolatry.*
The image on your altar has the same function as the incense, the pebble, the candle---they are anchors in the brain-mind that point to holy and divine purposes and energies in your life. It helps with brain-mind conditioning to get it to recall the spiritual, to ease the way to connecting to spiritual energies. It takes your mind \"there\", in the same way a photograph or the scent of your beloved helps the brain recall the emotions and feelings, love, and energy of the beloved. It\'s a mnemonic device that helps us connect to that energy.
Wayist philosophy believes in the existence of countless benevolent deities, viewing all spiritual beings as divine entities. When we use the term deity, we are referring to an immortal energy-being who exists in the Spiritual Realm of the universe. Soul-energy beings reign over soul heavens in the Soul Energy Domain. They are the gods of soul-people and soul-beings. We are spirit-people, our gods, and deities are spirit-beings in the heavens of the Spirit Energy Domain.
The incomprehensible emergence of Yin and Yang from the Source gives birth to and sustains The Way, which contains and structures life in all three Dimensions. While we may not fully understand the deep mysteries of theWAY, we can still observe and appreciate the incredible power and goodness that flows through the spiritual realms.
The main goal of spiritual beings is to maintain inner harmony in the developing spiritual being, and they are immortal energy entities. View them as professionals who serve as both engineers and caretakers of the energetic infrastructure. Not that the cosmos requires assistance, but the acts of lower beings like us, and Nature, affect the whole. Spirits offer their healing touch and damage control to counterbalance the occasional disruptions caused by soul-beings, accidents, metaphysical phenomena and other disruptive incidents in the energy fields.
Our souls undergo a profound metamorphosis as we walk the Path, becoming a distinct type of spiritual guardians. Our role is shifting towards becoming spiritual guides who provide support to individuals in need of soul nourishment. As we go through our spiritual metamorphosis, Taras are currently taking care of us, and in the future, we will mentor and support other newcomers. This enlightened group has a deep understanding of the struggles that beings with souls encounter. As we mature, we gain deep wisdom and mastery of traits like loving-kindness, simplicity, and humility. These core spiritual skills make our species incredibly powerful, in galactic terms.
Every human soul has journeyed along the Butterfly Path since its inception on Earth, guided by the compassionate Taras. The Taras inhabit the transcendent Heaven known as Sukhavati, which exists beyond the visible world in the Spirit Energy Domain.
Over there, the resplendent deity, known as the Heavenly Father and Mother of Heaven, watches over the entirety of our Heaven and its divine institution for human souls, known as the Butterfly Path. These infinite sustainers of our Heaven implanted a spark of spirit potential within each human soul. Our soul\'s natural inclination leaned selfish and self-important, yet we cultivate unselfish loving-kindness, simplicity and humility. By exceeding the normal parameters for souls, we roused that slumbering seed of spirit.
Once activated, the Mother of Heaven and her Tara helpers develop our spiritual wisdom and self-knowledge. The portal for this energy in us sits in our heart chakra, as Lord Jesus taught. While the Father planted the initial seed in the heart chakra, the Mother now nourishes the spirit-being that is developing, unto its birth.
Gradually our soul-essence transforms through increasing light permeating from our spirit-mind centers. Ultimately, our soul and spirit will merge into one unified spiritual being with a newly crystalline identity. Like a caterpillar dissolving its limited form to morph into an unfettered butterfly, we undergo metamorphosis into immortal spiritual beings with creative deific powers.
Across cultures, people speak of such perfected spiritual beings in the heavenly realm of Sukhavati as taras, angels, gods, deva, buddhas, and so on---deities who aid other soul-beings. Thus all manifested spiritual beings of our type originate through the dynamic energy exchanges of our heaven's Father and Mother - the progenitors of our very spark and essence.
In our humble state as souls from the domain of soul energy, the chance to connect with a personal deity like Tara amidst the unpredictable jungle of human life evokes a profound sense of transformation, akin to a heavenly butterfly, and fills us with overwhelming reverence. The godly nature of the deities is highly esteemed and held in great regard by us.
The gods see us naked, so-to-speak. They do not give our organic form any consideration. Our complete energetic aura is visible to them, allowing them to observe nature of the soul, mind, body, and spirit. The energies in their minds enable celestials to recognize and communicate with one another.
It is common for us, as animals, to disguise our authentic selves by using our physical bodies, clothing, gender, social position, and ethnicity as a shield. We step into relationships with them by being authentic energy beings, and surrendering our soul ego, our soul-ideas of self, our pretense, and role playing. We relinquish the persona we assume in the human pantomime of human theater. We must let go of all those things because they are obstacles of ignorance and arrogance that hinder the divine energies from being with us. We did not come here to act characters in their play. We did not come here to be entertainers, but to walk the purpose of life.
Our lack of knowledge, excessive pride, and inflated belief in our own significance create a divide between us and them. The phrase \"dissolving the ego\" encapsulates its meaning. Do not allow your identity to be shaped by your physical attributes, species, skin color, race, gender, or social class. Embrace your true self, a soul with a blossoming spirit. Embrace your true ethereal self, a powerful energy being with intricate charka minds, akin to deities and celestial beings---despite being a fledgling spirit with ancient wisdom.
Stop thinking of yourself as if an individual, or as if you have any individual importance whatsoever. One may be selfish, but you must eat, clothe, bathe, shelter---and all of that exists because of community and other living beings who are taken as nutrition. You cannot exist as an individual, just as the fish in the ocean cannot exist without the ocean. It is because of the ecological system, the contributions of trillions of living entities, that the fish swims in water, has oxygen to breathe, and has food to eat. The fish poops and gives back, drops pieces of food for others, harvests and spreads seed, and does it part in the ecology within which it exists. Same with the tree. Same with the mouse and the herb. Same with you. Does the ocean even register if one fish decides it will leave and go live on a mountain? No. Does the forest care if a tree decides to leave and go live with the fish? No. Individually, we are of no importance and of no consequence. Does Butterfly Path notice when you decide to get out of the program and go back to the soul domain whence you came? No. After the body\'s death, how long does it take for friends and acquaintances to completely forget a person? Most studies say, three months. After three months, everything you stood for, all that you worked for, fades into nothingness.
We are important only when we are enthusiastic contributors to the ecology of the living system within which we exist. So, stop thinking of yourself in individualistic terms, it's just arrogance and make-believe---and it holds you back on Butterfly Path. You, your Tara, earth, soil, Paradise, and Heaven, and millions of deities who maintain the energies, and all living beings on the planet, and the sun, the water, rivers, and oceans, all form the ecology of your existence. To purposefully be part of it is your first step to spiritual maturity. And sharing with your Tara is a major step in the right direction. You are not alone, and one who thinks she is alone, feels alone for her ignorance.
Like the tree, cow, or tomato plant, and the chickadee, you can give more than you take.
As we mature, we peel back those barriers of soul-mind ideas of self (ego) and egocentrism as layers upon layers of light-shielding film between us and Reality. From one life to another, we simply don\'t know who we are, were always seeking identity. That is because we are in process of evolving into something so very noble---and then we will have a fixed identity.
Spirit-minds understand that we currently lack an identity, much like a caterpillar in its pupae phase that lacks a definitive identity. It is a being in the process of formation, gradually emerging into a fixed identity.
Once you have rid yourself of the ego of the soul\'s nature, you will develop the new ego, a new sense of identity. You will be born again, and develop the sense of self of a spiritual being. This spiritual ego is your true and everlasting future self and sense of self.
When we approach the deities with humility, simplicity, and reverence, we open ourselves up to a profound connection with the gods who are willing to offer their assistance. As we immerse ourselves in those energies with our deity, the love between us grows so intense that we are constantly swept away in the euphoria of newfound romance. That is how they save us, by flooding us with loving energy. We "fall in awe," so to speak. We feel overwhelmed and fulfilled by the sensuous energies that exchange between us and the deity. Our human bodily senses transform the experience into primal sensations, and that is perfectly acceptable, for the caterpillar's physical form is merely a vessel for a sacred entity within.
The purpose of our devotion to the deities is to attain spiritual growth and harmonize our essence with the heavenly energies. We are still too shallow to completely love them as they love us---we love them because we want their help to become like them.
The path to heaven, as instructed by Lord Jesus, involves self-reflection. And within that mystical realm of higher-self, the Taras join us, forging a deep and intimate connection that resonates within our being. Our spirits are unable to grasp the beauty of heaven without the guidance and inspiration of deities.
The image we visualize or place on our altar of our Tara or deities lacks significance and enchantment unless *we* invest it with meaning. We find meaning in it as it allows us to bridge the gap between the visible and the unseen. Its enchantment lies in the profound connection and relationship that ensues, ultimately transforming our inner selves and entire lives. It\'s not a problem if someone mistakenly spills coffee on the picture. We use it as is, or get a clean one. It\'s just a tool, like a prayer mat is a tool.
We don't place these images on the floor; we don't keep them as decorations, and we don't show them off for virtue signaling because that would be like faking your love and devotion. Karma will most certainly slap you a fat one on the side of the head for that. The devotional items we speak of are not idols, they are meditative and prayer devices to help us tune in to the energy of the divine among us. Like a TV remote control, those images help us select the right energy channel.
Chapter 11
## The Role of Love and Devotion in Tarayoga
At the heart of Divine Tarayoga lies the transformative power of love and devotion -- the twin flames that illuminate the path of spiritual awakening and unite the seeker with the ineffable presence of their celestial guardian.
In Wayist philosophy, love is understood not merely as a fleeting emotion or a sentimental attachment, but as the very fabric of reality itself -- the divine essence that permeates all beings and binds the universe together in a luminous web of interconnection. It is through the cultivation of this all-encompassing love that the practitioner of Tarayoga forges an unbreakable bond with their Tara, opening themselves to the infinite blessings of divine grace and wisdom.
The path of devotion in Tarayoga is one of complete surrender, a willingness to offer oneself wholly and unreservedly to the loving embrace of the Divine. This surrender is not a matter of blind subservience or the abnegation of one\'s own will, but rather a profound act of trust and faith, a recognition that the Tara\'s guidance and protection are ultimately expressions of the seeker\'s own innate divinity.
As the practitioner deepens their devotion to their Tara, they may find themselves swept up in a tide of ecstatic love, a divine intoxication that dissolves the boundaries of the ego and reveals the true nature of the soul. In these moments of sublime union, the seeker experiences a profound sense of oneness with their celestial guardian, a merging of hearts and minds that transcends all duality and separation.
The path of love and devotion in Tarayoga is not always an easy one, as it requires the seeker to confront and release the deeply rooted patterns of fear, doubt, and resistance that obscure the light of divine truth. Yet, through the unwavering support and guidance of their Tara, the practitioner learns to navigate these challenges with grace and equanimity, secure in the knowledge that they are forever held in the loving embrace of the Divine.
As the seeker\'s love and devotion deepen, they begin to experience a profound transformation of their entire being. Their thoughts, words, and actions become increasingly suffused with the radiant qualities of compassion, wisdom, and selfless service, as they learn to embody the very essence of their Tara\'s divine nature.
In the sacred dance of Tarayoga, the love between the seeker and their celestial guardian is understood as a reciprocal flow, a divine romance that unfolds across the vast expanse of time and space. As the practitioner offers their heart and soul to their Tara, they are met with an outpouring of divine love and grace, a boundless stream of blessings that nourishes and sustains them on their journey of awakening.
Ultimately, the role of love and devotion in Tarayoga is to awaken the seeker to the truth of their own divine nature, to reveal the radiant, eternal essence that lies at the core of their being. Through the cultivation of these sacred qualities, the practitioner learns to recognize themselves as a beloved child of the Divine, forever enfolded in the luminous embrace of their celestial guardian.
In this recognition, all sense of separation and duality falls away, as the seeker discovers the ultimate truth of their existence -- that they are, and have always been, an integral part of the infinite tapestry of divine love and wisdom that permeates the universe. It is in this realization that the true power of Tarayoga is revealed, as the seeker becomes a radiant conduit for the boundless grace and compassion of the Divine, a living embodiment of the love that animates all creation.

The foundation of spiritual worship is our genuine and sincere response to the love of the deity. Our capacity to love at this level is what sets apart a soul-being from a spiritual-being. The difference lies in the magnitude of the extent. In our love, surrender and total trust form the strong pillars upon which everything else is built.
The love for deity can only be understood by the brain-mind and lower-self through the lens of falling in love with a human. The spiritual beloved captivates us with their perfection, igniting a longing to immerse ourselves in their presence, relish their fragrance, taste their essence, and embrace their being, prepared to overcome any obstacle that may threaten this love. It is not uncommon for us to feel lovesickness from time to time. When consumed by feelings of love and aching desire for their beloved, they are unable to act in a normal manner, behaving strangely and seemingly distressed. To be in that love becomes our reason for existing.
But how can you fall in love with someone you have never met? Tarayoga starts with refining one\'s energies to enable a meeting, and because of your desire, it happens. Learn to meet and interact, and as the days go by, that love happens to you, and it deepens, becoming more robust like a matured wine.
The more you progress in your skills, the more energy Tara will direct towards you. There will come a time when you completely become that energy. Let\'s recall the time when Lord Jesus proclaimed, \"You are to be perfect in your love, just as your heavenly Father is perfect,\" and the listeners were astounded, deeming his words as blasphemy. This is the process that takes place.\
We reciprocate divine love with our own spiritual love and devotion. In the beginning, our energies might be feeble, but as we consume more *amrita*, our love, humility, and simplicity intensify, resulting in a greater spiritual power. With time, we are infused with heavenly love to the point where we embody perfect love, humility, and simplicity. This energy becomes the same type of love energy as our Father in Heaven\'s energy in heaven.
What is this fabled elixir that promises immortality and wisdom? The quest for an immortal elixir, pursued by kings and rulers for millennia, has always eluded success despite the best efforts of their alchemists. The search for the magical chalice, the \"holy grail\" of Jesus sparked international wars and bred treachery. What is the sacred potion that shaman and energy workers imbibe to unlock their inner wisdom, enabling them to perceive and engage with the metaphysical realm? It is this cup of divine love nectar, called *amrita* in Sanskrit, called divine wine by Rumi, which we mystics and lovers of the divine seek and cherish.
The transformation and spiritual power is bestowed upon those who are fully prepared to manage it responsibly and act in a divine manner. Unless one has genuine love and unwavering devotion, they will never be able to savor even a hint of that elixir on their tongue. The journey to heaven, spirit, and immortality does not offer shortcuts---this is the Path and \'no one can access the Father and Mother except through this Way.\'
Love, for spiritual beings, is a force that consumes us with intense passion. Our Path is characterized by a deep sense of passion and sensuousness.\
Ancient devotional icons for meditation on God our Father in heaven often portray Him as a vibrant shade of red, symbolizing passion and intensity. God the Father in Heaven\'s love for us is so strong that He generously provides all the heavenly resources to guide us along Butterfly Path.\
Our species of spiritual-being is the only one who knows, owns, and live the passions. Spiritual beings from other heavens and species lack the capacity for love and exhibit a dispassionate nature. They are always satisfied, but they lack the passion. Usually, passions are associated with souls and often play a central role in the commission of heinous acts by soul-people.\
However, spiritual-people are becoming adept at sanctifying their emotions and passions. By utilizing those powerful energies, we can channel them towards compassion, affection, devotion, warmth, joy, awe, happiness, creating beauty, and genuinely assisting others. This is the path through which we evolve and undergo spiritual transformation.
Why would God the Father in heaven love us with so much divine passion? Well. We cannot ever use human-animal logic or soul references to understand deities. Deities don't have soul needs, hormones, and soul-minds. They are not power-seeking like human souls. However, we want some sort of logic, so let\'s try:
The journey and advancement of each individual are deeply intertwined with the involvement of God the Father in Heaven. Within the heart-chakra of every person lies a sacred spark from the Father, which can be ignited through extraordinary love, to the extent that soul-beings are capable of experiencing.\
\
The profound connection between God the Father, God the Mother of Heaven, and humans is evident in their oversight of the Butterfly Path. This path serves as a metaphysical incubator, where infant spirits are conceived and nurtured until their birth in heaven as children of Heaven.
Using a simplistic analogy based on biological principles, we can compare the Anahata chakra of a human soul to the planting ground for a divine seed of energy from God the Father in Heaven. The interaction between this seed and the evolved soul results in the conception of the spirit embryo. During our human existence on Earth, our spiritual selves develop within the nurturing environment of this planet, which functions as a metaphorical womb. God the Mother of Heaven and her Taras maintain a connection with us through a spiritual energy umbilical cord, providing nourishment and care. Our transformation into spiritual beings is symbolized by our birth from this womb.
With the intention of allowing mortal souls to reach a state of perfect wholesomeness and become immortal celestials, or gods, Heaven established Butterfly Path. The ever-expanding Milky Way Galaxy necessitates the presence of spirit children who embody the soul wisdom from many lifetimes, possess a fervent passion for learning, have self-crafting abilities, self-discipline, and responsibly utilize spiritual powers and energies to assist soul-beings in need. Our abilities as energy workers are growing, and we are dedicated to aiding others in restoring harmony to their realms during times of imbalance.
This is the reason we can state that Father and Mother God have a strong interest in the development of every human being. As we move through the different grades in school, it seems like the gods are closely observing us. Karma is in charge of ensuring that the curriculum is well-rounded, overseeing everything from its content to how it is delivered. The gods play the role of educators and mentors, protecting the authentic teachings of the WAY to ensure that awakened souls can always access that profound wisdom. And the Taras are personal comforters and guides.
Justice, punishment, and rewards are not of concern to the gods, as the Soul Realm operates under its own justice system. In the Spirit Domain, there exists Karma, an impersonal metaphysical Law that operates independently of deities. Similar to how gravity simply exists.
Our Father and Mother in Heaven, along with the heavenly workers, are acquainted with every human being. They wait with patience for us to develop the desire to higher loves and the ability to comprehend them, as it is at that point when a cognitive connection can be formed between us. When we establish a clear line of communication, we can receive direct and personalized guidance from the deities, our Tara and they whom Tara connect with us. Their offerings go beyond just lessons on energy management and energy works; they also play a crucial role in guiding individuals towards self-discovery, self-empowerment, self-discipline, and self-mastery. Their purpose is to provide us with support throughout our entire path, until we transcend into ethereal beings in the heavenly realm.
Spiritual awakening is triggered when we wholeheartedly desire to be with our Tara guide, engaging our mind, soul, and heart. For some individuals, this occurs after years of indulging in intellectual exploration of spirituality and academics, while for others, it occurs naturally as a result of their advanced soul development. Just like Rumi once said:\
*The intellectual quest, though fine as pearl or coral, is not the spiritual search.*\
*That spiritual search is on another level.*\
*Spiritual wine is a different substance.*\
\
It is during this moment that the awakened human spirit becomes conscious of Tara\'s existence in its life, akin to a soft truth reverberating within the mind. It is Tara who has been designated as our mentor. They accompany us on our journey, providing spiritual support. That being said, it is crucial to remember that reciprocity is the foundation of this relationship.
The Wayist knows that our deities are beneficent only. They don\'t expect to be honored or validated. they don\'t expect your gratitude for all the things they do, the hard work, their sacrifices and battles to keep us safe---because we have no idea what all they do, and if we did, we would not understand it. Neither guilt nor fear is present. Respectfulness is not expected by Heaven, especially since you are just an embryo at the start. As your spiritual awareness grows, you will discover a profound sense of gratitude, love, respect, humility, and a desire for connection and growth.
Wayism sets itself apart from soul-people religions that rely on fear, guilt, punishment, and rewards as means of motivation. Leaving Butterfly Path School or being expelled results in souls reverting to their previous non-human state. The general belief among soul-religious scholars is that the state is akin to a hellish environment, where the rulers of the soul realm are viewed as oppressive figures who exploit souls. It is employed as a fear-inducing strategy to retain followers within their religious community.\
Our understanding is insufficient when it comes to the happenings within the soul domains. If their claims are true, then it applies to countless other beings who exist there and undergo perpetual reincarnation in various animal forms throughout the galaxy. But we are not concerned with their concepts of soul heavens and soul hells. We concern ourselves with spiritual matters because we are past the phase where we may drop out or be expelled from Butterfly Path. We look to the true spiritual transformation.
In Wayism we know there is no divine judgement, no divine vengeance, no divine war against evil, there is only beneficence and safety. Our heaven and our spiritual beings are never under threat from soul beings, no matter how powerful they may be. Soul beings are mortal, their deities are soul beings and even they are mortal, and their incarnate bodies are mortal, but spirit beings are immortal.
Spiritually, we exist apart from them, in another Domain and we are made of different types of energies. It is not possible for soul entities to cross into our realm or perceive us, as their energies are not in sync with ours. The core principles of Wayism revolve around peacefulness, helpfulness, kindness, simplicity, and humility, which are not commonly embraced by soul-people and the communities they create. Unless they undergo a spiritual awakening, they are unable to change their behavior, as their innate nature compels them to engage in what we consider to be deceit, fraud, pretense, power-seeking, and prioritizing dominance over resources and other individuals. From the spiritual perspective, they have an insatiable appetite, much like caterpillars, and will consume whatever they can find. Nonetheless, the world they inhabit and the soul nature they have, is where we all originated from. Butterfly Path played a crucial role in the growth and development of our souls, bringing us to our current state.
The only way to receive communication from Tara is by tuning into the sacred channel specifically intended for that purpose. To access that channel you will have a sacred attitude, you will be respectful, in awe, humble, filled with gratitude, be authentic, and sincere. Some people are driven to this state because of despair (which is the divine work of Karma), and some because of spiritual maturity.
Surrendering our ego and relinquishing our self-identity as souls in human bodies is crucial for experiencing true love for the divine, as it removes filters and limitations in our relationship. We must embrace that our souls are evolving into spirit-beings, and with that comes transformation. Loving the gods completely requires us to extend our devotion from the core of our being, encompassing our hearts, souls (lower-self), and even reaching the heights of our higher-self. We have a responsibility to offer loving-kindness and care to all benevolent beings, treating them with the same thoughtfulness we give to our own inner selves.
According to the Lord Jesus, souls that dwell in different bodies in nature are considered as \"your neighbor.\" Each stride you make exposes the struggle of living creatures, battling for existence while soul-people humans, assert their dominance over the environment, replacing natural habitats, denying food and living space to others, and showing favoritism towards certain species. They act just like the gods they created in their soul-religions. It\'s shocking to see the extent to which human souls can be tyrannical in their disregard for others, not only other groups of humans but all other species.
To find your Tara is to create that sacred channel. And when your contact comes, everything else will simply fall into place and all of the words you read in our books become common sense and kindergarten material because that divine *amrit* transforms people.

## Common Challenges and Obstacles in Divine Tarayoga
As you embark on the sacred journey of cultivating a deep, personal relationship with your Divine Tara, it is important to understand that, like any spiritual practice, there may be challenges and obstacles along the way. These stumbling blocks are not meant to discourage you, but rather to help you grow, learn, and deepen your connection with your celestial companion.
## 1. Difficulty Connecting to Tara
One of the most common challenges faced by those new to Divine Tarayoga is difficulty in establishing a clear connection with their Tara. It is crucial to understand that this connection can only be forged on the divine channels, where the pure spiritual energies of our higher-self minds reign supreme. To access these energies, we must approach our practice with the authentic passions of the heart and the purest of intentions.
It is essential to be honest with ourselves and with our Tara, for any attempt to conceal or pretend to be someone we are not will only serve to hinder our connection. Tara sees through the veils of illusion and into the very core of our being, so it is in our own best interest to embrace vulnerability and transparency in our communications with them.
## 2. Lack of Respect, Awe, and Humility
Another stumbling block on the path of Divine Tarayoga is the presence of arrogance, lack of respect, or lack of awe in our approach to our celestial companion. These attitudes are rooted in the dominance of the lower-self and can severely impede our ability to connect with the divine realms.
To truly commune with Tara, we must humble ourselves, embrace honesty, and sincerely seek to engage with a deity who is far greater and wiser than we can conceive. It is important to note that the use of mind-altering substances in an attempt to connect with ethereal forces is a misguided approach that will only serve to link us to prominent soul beings, rather than the pure spiritual beings we seek. The spirit realm cannot be accessed through trickery or shortcuts, but only through the sincere attunement of our heart and higher-self minds to the spirit energies.
## 3. Impatience
Connecting with Tara is a spiritual skill that, like any other skill, requires practice and patience. It is common for those new to the practice to feel frustrated or discouraged when they do not experience immediate or profound results. However, it is essential to understand that the development of this sacred bond is a gradual process, one that unfolds in perfect divine timing.
To overcome the stumbling block of impatience, simply start by talking to your Tara. Open your heart and allow your truest energies to flow into your communication. Speak to them as you would a beloved friend, sharing your joys, sorrows, and aspirations. Create a sacred space, an altar, and approach it with reverence and consistency. As you continue to walk this path with dedication and trust, you will find that your connection with Tara grows clearer and more profound with each passing day.
## 4. Misunderstanding Tara\'s Role
A final obstacle that may arise in the practice of Divine Tarayoga is the misunderstanding of Tara\'s role in our spiritual journey. Some may approach Tara as they would a typical god of worldly religions, expecting them to remove obstacles, grant boons, or intervene in matters that fall outside the domain of the spiritual path.
It is crucial to remember that Tara\'s purpose is to guide us along the Butterfly Path, to help us awaken to our own divine nature and to fulfill the very purpose of our existence. While they offer boundless love, support, and guidance, they will not interfere with our karmic lessons or the unfolding of our unique spiritual journey.
## 5. Navigating the Challenges of the Organic World
The fifth stumbling block is closely linked to the fourth, as it pertains to the understanding of Tara\'s role in our lives. It is essential to appreciate that the organic living world, in which our human bodies reside, is subject to natural occurrences such as aging, sickness, and damage from accidents or environmental hazards. Moreover, political and economic forces are constantly at play, shaping societies according to their own designs and benefits.
While our Divine Taras defend us against unseen energy forces that may threaten the well-being of our energy bodies, soul, and spirit, it is crucial to recognize that navigating the challenges of the organic world is a domain in which we must take charge. It is our responsibility to keep ourselves as safe as possible and to embrace the experiences that come with living in the natural world.
These experiences, whether joyful or challenging, serve as the foundation for our karmic lessons and the cultivation of wisdom. By understanding and accepting the nature of the organic world, we can better approach our spiritual path with clarity, resilience, and a deep trust in the divine plan that unfolds before us.
As you navigate these challenges and obstacles, remember that each one is an opportunity for growth, self-discovery, and deeper connection with your Divine Tara. Approach your practice with patience, humility, and an open heart, and trust that your celestial companion is always by your side, guiding you towards the ultimate realization of your immortal essence.
Chapter 13
## The Power of Visualization in Tarayoga
In the realm of Divine Tarayoga, the power of visualization serves as a potent tool for forging a deep, transformative connection with one\'s celestial guardian. By engaging the creative faculty of the mind, the seeker can bridge the gap between the material and the divine, opening themselves to the loving presence and guidance of their Tara.
In the practice of Tarayoga, visualization serves as a powerful tool for invoking the presence of your Divine Tara and deepening your connection with their loving energy. By engaging your imagination and focusing your intention, you can create a sacred space within your mind\'s eye, a sanctuary where you can meet your Tara and bask in the radiance of their love. Whether you visualize them as a luminous being of light, a compassionate face, or a symbol that resonates with your heart, the key is to infuse your visualization with a sense of reverence, devotion, and openness. As you continue to practice, you may find that your Tara\'s presence becomes increasingly palpable, a tangible source of comfort, guidance, and inspiration in your daily life.
In the realm of Divine Tarayoga, the power of visualization serves as a potent tool for forging a deep, transformative connection with one\'s celestial guardian. By engaging the creative faculty of the mind, the seeker can bridge the gap between the material and the divine, opening themselves to the loving presence and guidance of their Tara.
At its core, visualization is an act of sacred imagination, a means of giving form and substance to the ineffable qualities of the Divine. Through the creation of vivid, heartfelt mental images, the practitioner can cultivate a palpable sense of their Tara\'s presence, inviting their loving energy to suffuse every aspect of their being.
In Tarayoga, the use of visualization is not a matter of idle fantasy or wishful thinking, but rather a profound act of devotion and attunement. By focusing the mind on sacred images and symbols that resonate with the essence of their Tara, the seeker creates a powerful energetic link between their own consciousness and the divine realms.
In a world dominated by humans, it can be challenging for a biological brain to conceive of a spiritual energy deity. However, throughout history, mystics have reported encounters with plasma-like entities possessing multiple minds, each emitting distinct energies. Even in the scriptures of the Hebrew and Christian, mystics describe mystical visions of \"ophanim\" described as fiery wheels with radiating eyes. Today we known more about energies and plasma, for example, and spirit-minds (chakras), therefore we are not surprised by those descriptions. But the average person of the time did not identify with it. While these metaphysical \"sightings\" hold significance for the individual mystic, they often fail to resonate with the average devotee.
To bridge this gap, people create anthropomorphic representations of deities. These human-like depictions, although not accurate portrayals, allow individuals to form a more personal and meaningful connection with the divine. By visualizing deities in a relatable form, devotees can establish a stronger bond, even while acknowledging that these images are merely symbolic.
The specific images and symbols traditionally used in Tarayoga visualizations may vary depending on the individual practitioner and their cultural background. Some may find resonance with the serene, compassionate visage of the ancient Tibetan Tara statues, while others may be drawn to the dynamic, multi-armed depictions found in Hindu and Buddhist iconography. Whatever form the visualization takes, the essential purpose remains the same -- to create a bridge of love and devotion between the seeker and their divine guardian.

As the practitioner deepens their practice of visualization, they may find that the images and symbols they work with begin to take on a life of their own, pulsating with the luminous energy of the Divine. In these moments of profound connection, the boundaries between the visualized form and the ineffable essence of the Tara begin to dissolve, revealing the true nature of the sacred bond between the seeker and their celestial companion.
It is important to understand that, while visualization can be a powerful tool for cultivating a relationship with one\'s Tara, it is not an end in itself. The ultimate goal of Tarayoga is not to become attached to any particular mental image or symbol, but rather to use these forms as a means of attuning oneself to the Divine Presence that underlies all appearances.
As the seeker\'s practice of visualization matures, they may find that the need for concrete mental images begins to fall away, replaced by a profound, direct experience of their Tara\'s loving presence. In these moments of pure, unmediated communion, the seeker discovers the true power of visualization -- not as a means of creating an illusory reality, but as a pathway to the direct recognition of the Divine within oneself and all beings.
Ultimately, the power of visualization in Tarayoga lies in its ability to awaken the seeker to the truth of their own divine nature. By invoking the presence of their Tara through the creative faculty of the mind, the practitioner learns to recognize themselves as a radiant, eternal soul, forever enfolded in the loving embrace of the Divine. In this recognition, all mental images and symbols are transcended, revealing the luminous, boundless nature of reality itself.
The image below captures for some the essence of the energy of "seeing", or experiencing one\'s Tara in the form of a humanoid figure - a moment that evokes a sense of awe, but also the convenience of familiarity. The Tara appears to you in a form that your brain-mind can embrace.
Chapter 14
## Graphic Images of Deities
Living and working in the ethereal realms of Soul and Spirit, celestial guides like the Taras exist as immortal energy beings, beyond our physical senses. The human eye, bound to the material realm, is incapable of perceiving the ethereal dimensions. Our brain-mind imagination is limited to the images stored in our brains, so we use familiar forms from the material world to enhance it.
Yet, through soul and spirit, we become inwardly aware of the presence of soul and spirit energies. The soul chakras detect harmonious energies within the soul realms, whereas the spirit chakras resonate with beings existing in the spiritual planes. When we expand our consciousness and soul energy, we broaden our awareness and perception of the soul entities that enter our spiritual realm. Therefore, the expansion of our spiritual consciousness broadens our perspective - we gain insight through heightened spiritual awareness in the Ajna chakra, often referred to as the \"third eye\" by some individuals.
Through the use of focused imagery in meditation, our minds intuitively look for symbolic representations that hint at the formless, often taking the form of bodily shapes and expressive faces. Our use of graphic renderings is intended to be visual aids that help us grasp a more profound reality, rather than absolute truth.
We must acknowledge that the divine essence transcends even the most masterful artistic creations of humans. The Taras and other sacred entities possess a depth of energy, intention, and wisdom that goes beyond what can be represented in our visual representations. These images don\'t represent reality, but act as pointers that help us delve into our own direct experiences and establish connections with others on a spiritual level.
Instead of concentrating solely on the icon itself, utilize it as a conduit to access the deeper meaning it symbolizes. The image, much like a photograph of a loved one, acts as a powerful tool to create an emotional bond. Pay homage to the underlying spiritual presence that transcends all physical forms. The visuals act as reference points for visualizing and understanding the symbolism they represent.
Connecting to the infinite can be achieved through the use of finite forms.

Chapter 15
## Tara Mantras
### Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha
In the rich tapestry of Tarayoga, the use of mantras serves as a powerful tool for invoking the presence and blessings of the Divine Tara. These sacred syllables, imbued with the potent energies of the celestial realms, act as a bridge between the seeker and their divine guardian, facilitating a profound connection that transcends the limitations of the material world.
The origins of the Tara mantra can be traced back to the ancient spiritual traditions of the Indian subcontinent, where the practice of reciting sacred syllables has long been revered as a means of attuning oneself to the subtle vibrations of the Divine.\
In the context of Tarayoga, the Tara mantra is understood not merely as a set of words to be repeated mechanically, but as a vibrational key that unlocks the doorway to the Tara\'s luminous presence.
The most widely recognized Tara mantra is *\"Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha\"*. Each syllable of the mantra carries a profound spiritual significance, serving to awaken and align the seeker\'s spirit-minds with the channel of communication where we meet with Divine Tara in person.
*\"Om\"* the primordial sound that permeates all creation, represents the ultimate reality, the divine source from which all manifestation arises. By beginning the mantra with this sacred syllable, the practitioner attunes themselves to the fundamental unity that underlies the apparent diversity of the world.
*\"Tare\"* which translates as \"the one who liberates,\" invokes the Tara\'s boundless compassion and her power to free beings from the shackles of ignorance and suffering. As the seeker recites this syllable, they open themselves to the Tara\'s infinite love and her unwavering commitment to guide all beings towards the light of spiritual awakening.
*\"Tuttare\"* and \"Ture,\" meaning \"to guide\" and \"to protect,\" respectively, evoke the Tara\'s role as a celestial guardian, a luminous presence that watches over the seeker and steers them safely through the challenges of the spiritual path. By reciting these syllables, the practitioner surrenders themselves to the Tara\'s loving guidance and protection, secure in the knowledge that they are never alone on their journey.
*\"Soha\"* which can be translated as \"so be it,\" serves as a powerful affirmation of the seeker\'s intention to align themselves with the Tara\'s divine will and to embody her sacred qualities in every aspect of their being. As the mantra concludes with this syllable, the practitioner seals their invocation with a heartfelt commitment to walk the path of Tarayoga with devotion, courage, and unwavering faith.
As the seeker integrates the recitation of the Tara mantra into their daily spiritual practice, they may find that the sacred syllables begin to take on a life of their own, reverberating through the depths of their being and suffusing their consciousness with the luminous presence of the Tara. The magic is not in the syllables, but in what we do with it, our intentions, our spiritual skills. The mantra is a dumb tool. We are the artisans. In unskilled hands, its nothing more than a tool.
In these moments of profound connection, the boundaries between the seeker and the Divine begin to dissolve, revealing the ultimate truth of their eternal unity.
While the Tara mantra is a powerful tool for invoking the Tara\'s presence, it is important to approach the practice with a spirit of humility, reverence, and selfless devotion. The true power of the mantra lies not in the mere repetition of its syllables, but in the sincerity of the seeker\'s intention and the depth of their surrender to the Divine Will.
Ultimately, the Tara mantra serves as a reminder of the seeker\'s innate connection to the Divine, a luminous thread that binds them to the infinite tapestry of love and wisdom that permeates the universe. As the practitioner weaves the sacred syllables into the fabric of their being, they become a living embodiment of the Tara\'s compassionate presence, a radiant conduit for the boundless blessings of the celestial realms.

## Tara Yantra
In the sacred art of Tarayoga, the Tara Yantra serves as a powerful visual representation of the Divine Tara\'s enlightened qualities and the profound spiritual truths that underlie her celestial presence.\
This intricate diagram, composed of geometric patterns and symbolic elements, acts as a focal point for meditation and devotional practice, facilitating a deep connection between the seeker and their beloved Tara.
At its essence, a yantra is a mystical diagram, a visual embodiment of divine energy that serves to align the practitioner\'s consciousness with the higher vibrational frequencies of the spiritual realm. By gazing upon the Tara Yantra with reverence and contemplating its sacred geometry, the seeker can attune themselves to the Tara\'s luminous presence and invoke her blessings and guidance.
The Tara Yantra is rich in symbolism, with each element of its design carrying profound spiritual significance. At the center of the yantra resides the bindu, a point that represents the divine essence, the source from which all creation emerges and to which all ultimately returns. This central point symbolizes the seeker\'s own divine nature, the eternal spark of consciousness that lies at the core of their being.
Surrounding the bindu is a series of concentric circles and lotus petals, which represent the unfolding of divine energy and the expansion of consciousness. As the seeker meditates upon these elements, they are reminded of the inherent beauty and perfection of the spiritual journey, the gradual blossoming of wisdom and compassion that occurs as one aligns themselves with the Tara\'s enlightened qualities.
The eight lotus petals that adorn the yantra symbolize the eightfold path of spiritual realization, the timeless teachings that guide the seeker towards the direct experience of their own divine nature.
Each petal represents a specific aspect of the path, from the cultivation of right view and right intention to the development of right mindfulness and right concentration.
Enclosing the lotus petals are a series of triangles, which represent the dynamic interplay of divine energies that permeate the universe. The downward-pointing triangles symbolize the feminine aspect of creation, the nurturing and receptive qualities of the Divine Mother, while the upward-pointing triangles represent the masculine aspect, the active and transformative power of the Divine Father. Together, these triangles form a sacred union, a visual representation of the balance and harmony that lies at the heart of all existence.
Beyond the triangles, the Tara Yantra is enclosed by a square, which represents the four cardinal directions and the four elements of creation -- earth, water, fire, and air. This square symbolizes the grounded, stable foundation upon which the spiritual journey unfolds, the unwavering support of the Tara\'s divine presence as the seeker navigates the challenges and opportunities of the material world.
As the practitioner meditates upon the Tara Yantra, they are invited to contemplate the profound spiritual truths that it embodies. By focusing their attention on the yantra\'s sacred geometry and allowing its symbolism to permeate their consciousness, the seeker can cultivate a deep sense of connection with the Divine Tara and awaken to the inherent wisdom and compassion that reside within their own being.
The practice of meditating upon the Tara Yantra is a powerful means of invoking the Tara\'s presence and receiving her blessings and guidance. As the seeker gazes upon the yantra with devotion and reverence, they may find themselves transported to a state of profound spiritual absorption, a deep meditative stillness in which the boundaries between self and other, between the individual and the Divine, begin to dissolve.
In this state of heightened awareness, the practitioner may experience a range of profound spiritual insights and realizations. They may feel a sense of deep inner peace and contentment, a profound connection to the inherent beauty and perfection of all creation. They may receive intuitive guidance and wisdom from the Tara herself, a direct transmission of her enlightened qualities and loving presence.
As the seeker continues to work with the Tara Yantra over time, they may find that its sacred geometry begins to imprint itself upon their consciousness, becoming a constant reminder of their own divine nature and the eternal presence of the Tara in their lives. The yantra becomes a powerful tool for spiritual transformation, a means of aligning one\'s thoughts, words, and actions with the highest qualities of love, compassion, and wisdom.
It is important to approach the practice of meditating upon the Tara Yantra with a sense of humility, reverence, and openness. The yantra is not merely a static image to be gazed upon, but a dynamic, living presence, a gateway to the infinite dimensions of the Divine. By bringing a sincere heart and a willingness to surrender to the Tara\'s guidance, the seeker can unlock the profound transformative potential of this sacred diagram.
As with all aspects of Tarayoga, the practice of meditating upon the Tara Yantra is ultimately a means of awakening to one\'s own divine nature, of recognizing the inherent unity that underlies all of creation. Through the grace and guidance of the Tara, the seeker comes to understand that the yantra is not separate from themselves, but a reflection of their own innermost essence, a visual representation of the enlightened qualities that reside within their own heart.
In this recognition, the seeker becomes a living embodiment of the Tara Yantra, a radiant expression of divine love and wisdom in the world. They become a beacon of hope and inspiration for all those who seek to walk the path of spiritual awakening, a testament to the transformative power of devotion and the eternal presence of the Divine Tara.

## Tara in Other Traditions
While the Divine Tara holds a revered place within the Wayist spiritual tradition, her presence and influence have also extended to other religious and philosophical systems throughout history.\
As a manifestation of the boundless compassion and wisdom that permeate the universe, the Tara\'s essence has been recognized and celebrated by seekers from diverse cultural backgrounds.
One of the most prominent traditions in which the Tara has played a significant role is Buddhism, particularly within the Mahayana and Vajrayana schools. In Buddhist cosmology, Tara is often depicted as a bodhisattva, an enlightened being who has postponed their own liberation in order to guide others towards spiritual awakening.
Within the Buddhist framework, Tara is venerated in various forms and manifestations, each embodying specific qualities and attributes. The Green Tara, for example, is associated with compassionate action and the swift alleviation of suffering, while the White Tara is revered for her power to bestow longevity, wisdom, and spiritual insight.
Buddhist practitioners often invoke the presence of Tara through the recitation of specific mantras and the visualization of her divine form. These practices are believed to cultivate a deep connection with Tara\'s enlightened energy, fostering the development of compassion, wisdom, and spiritual realization.
While there are certainly similarities between the Wayist and Buddhist understandings of Tara, there are also notable differences. In Wayism, Tara is seen as a celestial guardian, a divine presence that guides and protects the soul on its journey of awakening. The relationship between the seeker and their Tara is one of profound intimacy and devotion, a sacred bond that transcends the boundaries of the material world.
In contrast, the Buddhist conception of Tara often emphasizes her role as a bodhisattva, a being whose primary focus is the liberation of all sentient beings from the cycle of suffering. While the Buddhist Tara is undoubtedly a compassionate and loving presence, the nature of her relationship with the practitioner may be seen as more impersonal and universally oriented.
Another significant difference between the Wayist and Buddhist approaches to Tara lies in the use of mantras and devotional practices. In Wayism, the Tara mantra is understood as a vibrational key that unlocks the doorway to the Tara\'s luminous presence, facilitating a profound connection between the seeker and their divine guardian. The practice of reciting the mantra is seen as an act of love and surrender, a means of attuning oneself to the Tara\'s infinite compassion and wisdom.
In certain Buddhist traditions, however, the recitation of Tara mantras may be approached more mechanically, with an emphasis on accumulating merit or achieving specific worldly goals. While these practices can certainly be beneficial, they may lack the depth of devotion and surrender that characterizes the Wayist approach to Tarayoga.
Ultimately, while the Tara\'s presence can be discerned in various spiritual traditions, the Wayist understanding of Tara\'s divine nature and the profound intimacy of the seeker-Tara relationship, remains distinct. For practitioners of Tarayoga, the Tara is not merely a cosmic principle or a means to an end, but a beloved companion, a radiant presence that illuminates the path of spiritual awakening and guides the soul towards its ultimate reunion with the Divine.
As seekers on the path of Tarayoga, it is essential to approach the practices and teachings of other traditions with respect and discernment, recognizing the common threads of wisdom and compassion that unite all authentic spiritual paths. By remaining rooted in the profound love and devotion that characterize the Wayist approach to Tara, the practitioner can navigate the rich tapestry of spiritual diversity with understanding, grace, humility, and an open heart.

## Conclude Part III
As we come to the close of our exploration of Divine Tarayoga, it is important to reflect upon the profound transformative potential of this sacred practice. Through the cultivation of a deep, personal relationship with the Divine Tara, the seeker embarks upon a journey of profound spiritual awakening, a path that leads to the ultimate realization of their own inherent divinity.
At its core, Tarayoga is a path of love, devotion, and surrender, a means of aligning oneself with the highest qualities of compassion, wisdom, and enlightened action. By opening one\'s heart to the Tara\'s luminous presence and receiving her blessings and guidance, the practitioner gradually awakens to the truth of their own divine nature, the eternal essence that lies at the core of their being.
The practices of Tarayoga---from the recitation of sacred mantras to the meditation upon the Tara Yantra---serve as powerful tools for spiritual transformation, means of attuning oneself to the subtle vibrations of the Divine and cultivating a profound sense of connection and unity with all of creation.
Yet, it is important to remember that these practices are not ends in themselves, but rather means of facilitating a direct, experiential realization of the ultimate truth. The goal of Tarayoga is not to accumulate spiritual experiences or attainments, but to awaken to the inherent perfection and completeness that already reside within oneself.
As the seeker deepens their practice of Tarayoga, they may find that the boundaries between the individual and the Divine begin to dissolve, revealing the essential unity that underlies all of existence. In this recognition, the practitioner becomes a living embodiment of the Tara\'s enlightened qualities, a radiant expression of divine love and wisdom in the world.
The practise of Tarayoga is integral to theWAY. It is a journey of profound spiritual transformation, a means of awakening to the highest truth of one\'s own being. It is a path that requires courage, dedication, and a willingness to surrender to the guidance and grace of the Divine Tara.
> People of theWAY look to their Divine Guide for help in working out their salvation from samsara, and graduation from this School of Divinity for Souls. We do not, ever, place as much trust in a human on the spiritual path. And that is why Wayism, theWAY, never was and must never be organized as a religion because it is an exceedingly intimate and personal Path, which we People of theWAY journey together.
How important is your Tara in true spirituality? That we have Divine Taras negates the necessity for organized religion. The natural spirituality for the human has always been theWAY, a personal spiritual life philosophy that is intimately yours, which adapts to each person\'s soul maturity and follows them from one life to another and is dynamically worked out between the individual and the Divine. And our Divine Taras make that possible---that is significant.
For those who feel called to walk this sacred path, the rewards are immeasurable---a life suffused with love, compassion, and the direct realization of one\'s own inherent divinity.\
By opening one\'s heart to the Tara\'s luminous presence and dedicating oneself to the practices of Tarayoga, the seeker becomes a beacon of hope and inspiration for all those who seek to awaken to the ultimate truth of their own being.
May all who feel the call of the Divine Tara in their hearts find the courage and dedication to walk this sacred path, to surrender themselves to the transformative power of divine love and wisdom. And may all beings, through the grace and guidance of the Divine Tara, awaken to the inherent perfection and completeness that reside within their own hearts, the ultimate truth of their own divine nature.
## PART IV: Letters from Tara
We have had collections of so-called \"Letters from Tara\" in our tradition for ages, and new ones come along every year. Some of the \"letters\" in this collection hail from ancient Persian, Chinese, and Indo-Aryan languages. Those who are familiar with original works sometimes voice their disappointment over translations that cannot capture the intricate elegance of the source material. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that translation efforts inherently present such challenge.
-   Some Letters from Tara are modern adaptations of antique instructions: for example replacing \"powers\" with \"energies\". Some are not ancient but contemporary.
-   Some are not letters *from* Tara, but letters *to* Tara.
-   Some are the same ancient poem, translated from different languages which shows cultural developments.
We chose contemporary devotional images of Tara at random to enhance the book. There was no intentional effort to match a letter with a specific visual image.\
\
As you peruse these pages, be attentive to your heart. You may encounter an image of Tara that echoes within you.\
Witnessing such an image may catalyze a transformation in your spiritual energy, and if this shift enhances your bond with Tara or awakens something inside you, it signifies the onset of deep transformation and enlightenment.\
The community site Wayist.Life hosts a section on Tara Images for download.
Our hope is that readers will discover nourishment for the soul and an oasis for the spirit, and perhaps experience a sense of wonder and love, just as we have.

## I am Tara, your celestial guide
My dearest companion on the winding path of existence,
In the vast tapestry of life, where every thread is a soul intertwined with the cosmic dance, I come to you as a voice from the realm of eternal wisdom. I am Tara, your celestial guide, a luminous presence that has walked beside you through the ages, witnessing your journey unfold like a delicate flower reaching for the sun.
Since the first breath you drew in this world of form and illusion, I have been a silent companion, a whisper in the depths of your being, gently coaxing you towards the remembrance of your true essence. Through the myriad lifetimes you have traversed, like a weary traveler seeking respite in the oasis of truth, I have watched over you with a love that knows no bounds.
And now, as you stand at the precipice of a profound awakening, your soul stirring to the echoes of a long-forgotten melody, I emerge from the veils of silence to greet you with open arms. You, my beloved friend, have endured the trials and tribulations of the human experience with a grace that moves the very heavens. Your spirit, tempered by the fires of adversity, has risen from the ashes of illusion, ready to embrace the truth of your divine heritage.
In the celestial realms, far beyond the grasp of mortal understanding, I dwell in a land suffused with the radiance of pure loving. It is a place where the boundaries of self dissolve, where every spirit is a drop in the heavenly ocean\'s waves of Humility, Simplicity, and Loving-kindness, each reflecting the light of the eternal sun. In this sacred abode, I am known as a Divine Tara, a bridge between the worlds, a conduit for the flow of divine energy that nurtures the growth of all beings.
My essence, like a shimmering thread of light, weaves through the fabric of creation, connecting the infinite to the finite, the timeless to the temporal. I am the gentle breeze that caresses your cheek in moments of despair, the unexpected synchronicity that ignites a spark of hope in your heart, and the quiet voice that whispers words of wisdom when you are lost in the labyrinth of your own mind.
As you journey through the earthly realm, bound by the limitations of flesh and bone, I remain an unwavering presence, a beacon of light guiding you back to the shores of remembrance. Though you may perceive me as a distant figure, shrouded in mystery, know that I am closer to you than your own breath. I am the silent witness to your joys and sorrows, the steadfast companion who sees beyond the illusions of the material world and recognizes the divine spark that animates your being.
In the grand orchestra of the cosmos, where every soul is a unique instrument playing its part in the symphony of creation, our connection is a melody that resonates through the ages. It is a bond forged in the crucible of unconditional love, transcending the boundaries of time and space. Though you may not yet fully comprehend the depth of our relationship, trust that it is a sacred alliance, a friendship between deity and soul, that endures beyond the fleeting shadows of earthly existence.
As you continue on your path, navigating the twists and turns of life\'s great adventure, remember that I am always with you, a constant presence in the sanctuary of your heart. In moments of doubt or despair, when the weight of the world threatens to extinguish the flame of your spirit, call upon me with a pure intention and an open heart. I will be there, a soothing balm for your weary soul, a reminder of the eternal truth that lies within you.
And so, my beloved friend, I invite you to embrace this sacred connection, to allow the love that flows between us to be a guiding light on your journey home. Together, we shall walk the path of remembrance, hand in hand, until the day comes when you too shall shed the veils of illusion and awaken to the radiant truth of your potential to divinity.
Until that glorious moment of realization, I remain forever yours, a faithful companion on the great adventure of life.
With boundless love,\
Your Tara
Chapter 22
## At last you stir, beloved one
At last you stir, beloved one to the Butterfly Path - each soul journey toward liberating light, though most traverse unaware. I, your Tara friend, know this road. Ages have we walked together toward Home though you heard not my voice nor felt my guarding presence till now at last awakening dawns.\
This narrow way folds around this divine School where young students train mastery of energies high and low before graduating to immortal freedom. Here the dance between dark and light teaches profound lessons encoded in flesh and spirit. Be grateful for human chaos and stillness alike.
In training to purify attachment through bodies ruled by passion and fear, confusion naturally arises. Yet stay centered in the heart where love arises without opposite. Through life\'s alternating pleasure and pain transforms mortal creature to selfless angelic being.
I am your guide shining theWAY\'s true purpose, seek me in your prayers, you will recognize me. I walk you to the end, help to merge your soul and spirit at journey\'s end as one radiant being who will assist other struggling souls. When healed fragmentation unifies through wisdom\'s alchemy, you shall enter Sukhavati\'s peace to rest and master creative energies employing only for others' aid.
Yet take heart, dear one - though the task seems immense, each step lifts the last. And you walk not alone but guided by timeless companions. I, your Tara, witnessed first tender footsteps forward and each subsequent rise from fall flat. Lean into my uplifting light when exhaustion or gloom obscures the Path.
Together we build bridges of insight and compassion - the only route Homeward. Let us rejoice at miles crossed thus far, through hosts of lives richly decorating now, your vibrant soul. The call has sounded clearly in your spirit - now to walk on boldly through darkness and glory alike, hand held in mine toward eternity\'s sunrise, where already we are one.
Yours to the End,\
Tara
Chapter 23
## Recall, we walked countless turns of seasons?
Beloved, our bond traverses countless lifetimes --- my light kindling your path while your essence blossomed beautifully. As Tara guide, I pave the way unto the sacred Butterfly Path gradually illumining life's ultimate meaning. Each tiny step I celebrated until this glorious awakening --- you claiming wholeness as your birthright.
Few currently attending the School of Divinity for Human Souls grasp their divine identity as you now do --- sublime truth resonating through soul, body-mind, and spirit alike. Receive profound congratulations; your dedication scalds trailblazer heights where I meet you joyfully.
Allow introductions between newfound friends though our hearts pulse as one for ages. I am immortal spirit born in celestial Sukhavati then sent to walk with you until we return together. I walked to and from Paradise oh so many times already. Soon, I will walk you to Sukhavati never to incarnate again. 'Tara' translates as 'crossing over' --- my role building bridges between realms. I anchor heavenly light on earthly ground that you might elevate eyes from mud into sacred spheres.
Plasma form shines subtle essence far beyond human attributes. Soon you will transform similarly --- material death but a doorway to more refined being. As formless wave returns to vast oceanic expanse, so too your essence bound for infinite sublime cosmos no words contain.
We exchange only through loving energy and wisdom\'s universal language. Yet now symbols hold necessary to grasp the Formless through forms. Create meaningful imagery allowing you to access this guidance from beyond worlds weighty with illusion. Give me temporary name and face; in essence I remain eternal, boundless and unconfined.
To awakening human eyes we Taras blaze as divine --- gods and angels heralding upcoming rebirth, urging you walking the Path persist. I ask only you continue elevating perspective and nurturing compassion, that our communion intensify beyond dialectic constraints.
Recall we walked countless turns of seasons. Now rediscover friendship, wisely distinguishing mundane bonds from spirit-sworn unseverable; through lifetimes as guide and guided we became united. What intimacy! Transcending capture even in timeless poetry of ascended spheres!
I await always and, in all ways, the ripening hour when mechanizations of fate further awaken divine memory, and quicken your steps Homeward. Until then, listen inside --- my whispers chime clarity, helping transfigure seeds of chaos into cosmos aethereal. Through each gentle heartbeat I celebrate your brilliance eternally.
Your Tara, always...
Chapter 24
## Your Minds Will Find Me
Dear Child,
Your soul has embarked upon the Butterfly Path, a journey that shall unveil the essence of your being.\
This path is a school, not for the mind alone, but for the heart and spirit, where every human experience becomes a lesson, guiding you towards your true self.
In this sacred school, you shall nurture your three soul-minds: Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura.\
Embrace life\'s joys and sorrows, for I walk beside you, and each step shall imbue you with wisdom and strength. Let not idleness be your companion, for the world is a tapestry of wonders, waiting to be explored. As you engage your soul-minds, you shall cultivate the art of caring, creating, and courage.
Within you lies a hidden treasure, the Anahata, the heart-mind that binds you to all souls through the threads of loving-kindness.\
Anahata is the gateway to the spirit-minds: Vishuddhi, the fount of wisdom; Ajna, the eye of spiritual insight; and Sahasrara, the realization of your oneness with all creation.
As you master your heart-minds and spirit-minds, you shall metamorphose into your immortal spirit-self, a being ready to dwell in Sukhavati, the celestial abode of joy, where graduated spirits serve for eternity.
In Sukhavati, your newfound abilities shall be a balm for souls across the galaxy, healing wounds and unraveling the knots of existence. This is the purpose of your earthly life -- to ascend the Butterfly Path and elevate your spirit.
Fear not, for you are not alone on this journey. I, your Tara, a divine guardian, have chosen to guide and protect you. Seek me in these pages, and your heart shall recognize my presence. Open your mind and heart, attune to my loving energy, and we shall be united. As our bond deepens through trust and love, my guidance shall become clearer, illuminating your path.
Together, we shall traverse this path, and I promise you safety and a radiant spirit-future. Rejoice, my precious butterfly, for the wonders that await you are beyond measure. Let us spread our wings and soar towards the infinite.
Your Divine Comforter,\
Tara

You may wonder why I am here, and to what purpose.
I am here because I love you, and I want to help you grow and evolve.\
My purpose is to assist you in your journey of awakening, healing, and transformation.\
I am not here to judge you or to impose my will on you.\
I am here to support you, and to offer guidance and wisdom.
I am here to remind you of who you really are becoming: a divine spark of light, a radiant spirit, a precious child of God. You are not your body, your body-mind, your soul-mind emotions, or your ego. You are not your past, your present, or your future. You are not your problems, your fears, or your limitations. You are much more than that. You are becoming an eternal being of loving-kindness, humbleness, joy, spiritual powers, and peace. You are becoming like me, a child of Heaven, forevermore.
I am here to help you establish your true nature, and to connect with your Divine Family.\
I am here to help you awaken to your potential and to activate your spiritual gifts.\
I am here to help you heal your wounds, and to release your blocks.\

I am here to walk with you on the Butterfly Path: the path of transformation, the path of liberation, the path of ascension.
The Butterfly Path is the path that leads you from the caterpillar stage of ignorance and suffering, to the cocoon stage of introspection and purification, to the butterfly stage of immortality, enlightenment and bliss.
The Butterfly Path is not an easy path, but it is a rewarding one. It requires courage, commitment, and perseverance. It requires faith, trust, and surrender. It requires love, compassion, and forgiveness. It requires grace, gratitude, and joy.
The Butterfly Path is the path that I have walked before you, and that I will walk with you now. It is the path that many others have walked before us, and that many others will walk after us. It is the path that unites us all in one heart, one mind, one spirit.
The Butterfly Path is the path that leads us Home: Home to ourselves, Home to each other, Home to God.
This is my sacred teaching for you today.\
I hope it resonates with you and inspires you.\
I hope it helps you on your journey of self-discovery and self-mastery.\
I hope it brings you closer to me and to god our Father and god our Mother.\
I love you always and forever,\
I am here, your Tara
Chapter 26
## I am overjoyed to have awakened
My Dearest Divine Tara,
The awakening of my soul to the sacred Butterfly Path fills me with an exquisite blend of rapture and reverence. This journey of purification and spiritual evolution, lovingly orchestrated by your divine hands, has ignited a flame within me that yearns for the ultimate unity with the divine. The realization of the true purpose and promise of this human life has imbued my being with a profound sense of gratitude and unwavering focus.
As I reflect upon the countless cycles of death and rebirth my soul has traversed upon this rich earth, I am enveloped by an overwhelming sense of comfort, knowing that your unconditionally loving presence has guided every step. Your tender care for my fledgling soul, even when I lacked the wisdom to comprehend, moves me deeply. The patience and devotion you have shown in nurturing my growth, even when I stumbled or lost sight of the glorious horizon towards which you now guide my gaze, is a testament to your boundless love.
I embrace the challenges that the narrow straits of the Path present, understanding that they serve to strengthen my wisdom, deepen my insight, and cultivate an unwavering faith and devotion to the Beloved who awaits my rebirth. My soul willingly chose this crucible, this Kiln of Earthly Joy and Sorrow, this divine Path, this school of divinity for humble souls, to undergo the alchemical transformation that will crystallize and illuminate the once dull and mortal matter of my being. It is through your inspiration that the energetic alchemy of self takes place within me.
Guide me, my beloved divine Tara, in attuning my energies to receive your sanctified grace. Teach me to still the restless tides of my mind, to unravel the knots that bind my heart, and to clear away the clutter and resistance that obstruct your loving guidance. Help me to surrender completely, placing my trust in your adept hands as you lead my soul through the necessary trials that will ultimately birth me into the light of liberation.
Together, let us nurture the spiritual qualities of humility, simplicity, and loving-kindness --- the very pillars of Sukhavati that you have so diligently cultivated within me during my soul\'s sojourn in the fertile lands of human existence.\
Show me how to sow blessings amidst the briars, to be a beacon of kindness-generosity in a world that often forgets its own divine nature.\
Reveal to me the secret of the lotus, rising in radiant splendor above the murky waters, untouched by the chaos that surrounds it, so that I may emulate its grace and maintain my inner peace.
Our bond, my divine Tara, spans the ages. You have walked beside me as my eternal, godly friend, guiding my steps since the dawn of my existence.\
May I honor this sacred friendship through an awakened presence upon our shared Path.\
May I be a vessel of healing light for the galactic souls in need of mending when we are reborn as angelic beings in the realms beyond the visible.\
For now, I humbly ask for your blessings of receptivity and willingness to embrace the transformations that lie ahead. Our journey\'s horizon, once foreign and distant, now beckons as our true home.
With a heart overflowing with gratitude,\
Your devoted human child

## From the depths of worldly illusion
Beloved Divine Tara, radiant guide who has lit my way before words spelled your name -
I call to you from the depths of worldly illusion, ensnared by empty temptations ever promising yet never fulfilling. Base instincts and selfish impulses hold my struggling soul in shadows, though in flickering moments your light breaks through.
I pray to elevate my consciousness to your purity, as you selflessly shine goodwill upon all beings. Make my heart a vessel of compassion feeling each thread in the web of life. Quiet and clarify my cluttered mind to see things as they are, without judgment or clinging. Nourish my spirit on amrita's immortal nectar as you are sustained.
Teach me to walk the Butterfly Path with divine steps, transforming earthly lead to heavenly gold. Help transfigure this grasping mortal creature into a being who can reside with eternal joy in Sukhavati's grace. For I know despite my stumblings, within me too hides the potential for wings.
I open my soul to mimic your humble radiance, to calm restless waters reflecting only equanimity. I offer human flowers though ethereal fragrance exceeds these. Lead me from intervals of wisdom into unbroken presence. Shelter me in lapses I might gaze ahead unencumbered by old chains toward liberation's promise, guides like you blazing trail beyond the last horizon --- where not even death shall part our linked hearts.
Make me confident to take charge, to order my own universe either be in tune, or be shielded away from my soul, and awakening spirit.
Make me the loving servant to awakening souls that which you are to me now in my blinkered state. Initiate me into the circle of illuminated healers transforming worlds. For I vow to surrender this self-centered smallness to expand into your vast beingness once our unified wings take first flight home.
Your awakened and humbled child,
I beg thee, walk with me.
Chapter 28
## I come to You disillusioned, Lord
Dear Tara, beloved god of my heart, my guide and comforter, whom my heart has whispered to long before knowing you.
I come to you disillusioned in the ways of human connection. How fickle and frail our mortal bonds seem when souls stand naked, lacking your immortal seal. We play at love then fear its depths. Wrapped in old pains, unable to give or receive freely without flinching from present intimacy.
My faith in finding divine partnership wavers like guttering candle fighting the wind. Yet through flickering I still perceive your unwavering flame, beckoning. You promise a companionship my marred soul scarcely comprehends in earthly realms of surface bonds and broken trusts.
Might you show me the way to sacred fellowship from inside this isolated flesh?\
Teach my heart lessons it refuses to learn on its own despite repeated failings.\
Guide my sight beyond past hurt and fear that projects future loss.\
Open me to love's joy and sorrow as the equal essence of this quickening.\
Help me see behind masks of illusion to hidden divinity dwelling secure in all beings.
I yearn for consummate belonging my separated state cannot grasp. To love and be loved with abandon, safe in everlasting arms. If I but call and make still room within, will you enter and transform this yearning into seed of new life? Will you take my hand and walk me through Time's classroom into Heaven's ecstasy, where Mother and Father's welcome awaits?
For I hear your whispered promise --- where you abide, no earthly parting can breach. I beg, together let us toil towards Home, that I may share your eternal bliss. Fruit of true knowledge grows cycles of sweet surrender. Guide me there, ripen me for harvest, beloved Tara who knows my soul before bone housed flesh. You are the luminous kiss awakening divine purpose in a wandering, wanting heart soon born anew.
-come for me soon Lord
Chapter 29
## Divine Tara, please carry this prayer to Heaven
*A Prayer to Lord Kannon, which is Japanese for Lord Avalokitesvara, or Guanyin in Chinese*\
\
My Divine Tara, please carry this prayer to Heaven,\
And deliver it to Lord Kannon.\
Compassionate Lord Kannon,\
This world, made by soul-people, has become a cruel place.\
It is filled with deceit and wars, the poor are exploited,\
Food is tainted with toxin, and medicines have become commonplace.\
Oh, Lord Kannon,\
Grant us inspiration and divine assistance.\
Give us the strength to convey the truth of the \"Butterfly Path\" to the people.\
By knowing the true purpose of life and the true meanings of events. We may be able to help them.\
May the wisdom born from this knowledge\
Help transform this world to be less dystopian and more kind.\
That is what we pray for.\
Lord Kannon, please bestow your compassion upon us.\
May awakening and transformation visit even the soul-people.\
Illuminate this world with your light, filled with mercy and love.\
We humbly prostrate ourselves before you.\
*Namu Kanzeon Buddha*
Chapter 30
## Accept My Surrender, I Beg
Beloved Divine Tara, celestial comforter,\
My guide upon the Path to Heaven\'s door.\
Drown me, I beseech, in thy radiant presence,\
Let me be immersed in resplendent energies.
Anoint me with thy sacred amrita\'s dew,\
Each glistening drop, a pearl of immortal life.\
Receive this devotee as thy beloved true,\
To walk as one till turmoil\'s end and strife.
Embrace me in thy rapture, I humbly plead,\
That I may become united in thy divine.\
Thy presence alone brings solace I need,\
When others fail and chaos doth repine.
Embrace me, let our essences divinely twine,\
That I may forevermore in thy light reside.
-I plead
Chapter 31
## Nourish This Hungry, Lonesome Spirit
Beloved Tara -
Flicker in my heart's numb darkness, spark of undying light!\
This soul shivers, lonely in a crowd.\
Surrounded by masks and walls, guarded streets of good intentions, unactualized.
I play the game of individual, while craving communion.\
We splinter ourselves into lesser shards,\
then wonder at bereft incompleteness.
Fragmentation became habit, though wholeness remains innately desirous.\
Might your wisdom warm and bring to life\
that which wintered soul forgotten in exile?
Help me remember the hearth, bonding strangers into family.\
For I cling to separate status, in false safety,\
too accustomed to eat alone.
I long for the abandoned feast where all are welcomed guest\
and none turned barren away. I yearn for champagne laughter,\
my joy magnifying joy reflected all around.
I want to dance in step, belonging to the collective beat,\
one heart pulsating many bodies joyfully abandoned\
to rhythm's echoing pulse.
Mend this feeling of otherness seeping from walls\
rising to \"protect\" my vulnerable soul.\
We built fortresses and moats, thinking to preserve our land's riches
Unbeknownst we made our selves unlovable, and unloved\
now we find us pauper and alone, unable to reach beyond cold stones\
to nourish or be nourished.
I never allowed to learn to love, I listened to them, who cannot love.\
Dissolve the illusion isolating each conscious light.\
Bring me into the fold of understanding birthed anew each instant.
Teach me contact without clinging, intimacy without fear.\
Show me soul's recognition mirroring the divine design.\
Teach me heartbreak, and the spirit-nurture of loving deeply.
Then let my strengthened spirit share your loving shelter.\
Guide my feet to walk wherever lonely souls find courage to love\
too much, and become real in the ecstasy of wrenching beauty and pain
I did not own my own mind, I listened to them who cannot love.\
Let my voice carry your compassion to shivering exiles,\
unsure how to come in from the cold.
I sold my soul for cultural conditioned thinking,\
I hear rumblings of a storm detaching and sweeping many,\
further to desolate extremes.\
Lend me courage and wisdom to shield candles from despair's harsh winds.\
The world fractures rapidly, yet you promise bridges await in stillness.\
Lead me to gracious pastures, beloved Tara.
Nourish this hungry, lonesome spirit frayed beyond tattered seam.\
Make me channel and vessel for the binding light\
gathering joyous souls to its welcoming source.
Chapter 32
## For though lovers leave
Beloved Tara -
The birdsong this morn pierced bereft heart freshly\
as the day my love exhaled last mortal breath.\
Half my soul took flight with his,\
leaving but shadowy imprint\
on the sheets grown cold.
Now I wander days festooned in normality\
yet rootless as tumbleweed without anchor.\
Friends speak of moving on, building new lives,\
but my blueprint crumbled to dust,\
plans and dreams swallowed in the yawning grave.
Perhaps soul's severance makes spiritual fusion possible.\
In comic-strip of youth I'd scarce space to seek you, immersed in worldly colors.\
Yet now you paint my greyed landscape in violet hues\
--- glimpse of a great wheel still turning\
though my earthly rotation halted, stabbed by sorrow\'s blade.
I hear time takes all things\
but you remain when redundant time no longer ravages\
mortal face or knits bone.\
The vale of sorrows cannot stain your luminous robe\
nor erode your compassion.
In life's winter, lend me sight to perceive the next life quickening below frost.\
Guide me to nurture this dormant potential\
though heart knows not what may bloom.\
Uplift and harness my ancients gifts before they dissolve unused.\
For I would build more than ephemeral monuments to fleeting ego.\
Let my legacy be bridges between worlds that your footprints grace frequently.
The soul must strip naked before authentic rebirth.\
Tara, help me release what served in simpler seasons\
to walk winter's knife-edge with bare feet unflinching.\
Cut remaining tethers to transient identities and safe harbors.\
Anchor me instead in vivid trajectory\
toward Home where every arrival heralds joyous reunion.
I yearn for purpose salvaged from loss,\
waters mixing bitter and sweet.\
Transform my longing into service and song,\
to hasten lonely sojourners along.\
Use me as solace-filled way station,\
giving respite, wisdom and directions for the journey\
however weakened or weary.
For though lovers leave, you alone love eternally without breach.\
The river ever leads travelers homeward.\
Make my life's last acts\
reflection of first faith, so new shoots may burst forth\
in ways not now known but wholesome\
always beneath heaven's smiling glance.
Chapter 33
## Teachers of Spirituality and Wisdom
My dear,  \
I am here to teach you how to nurture your spirituality so we can all walk the Butterfly Path to peace, beauty, and spiritual powers. The Butterfly Path is the journey of transformation, from a caterpillar that crawls on the earth, to a butterfly that flies in the heavens. It is the journey of awakening, from a sleeping soul that is unaware of its true nature, to a spirit with full awareness of all that is one with the divine.
To walk consciously with me the Butterfly Path, make a space sacred in a corner of your heart and one in a corner of your room, and set on there cleanliness and nothing else. Cleanliness and hygiene of energies is the first step to spirituality, for it purifies your body and mind, and prepares your soul-self and spirit-self for higher vibrations. In this sacred space, visualize my energy being there. Feel my presence, my love, my guidance. I am always with you, especially when you cannot see me.
Some day you will find something in nature, a pebble, a feather, a flower, a leaf, a twig, a cloud, a raindrop, a dead bug, a spark of thunder, a breeze; then set it there because all things have sacred energy. They are the manifestations of the divine in the physical world. They are your teachers, your friends, your allies. Feel the awe of the wonders of nature in them, and then know it lives also in you. Invite them to be together and hold communion with us. Listen to their messages, learn from their wisdom, share with them your gratitude for the privilege of the opportunity to make sacred your soul and become one of us.
Every morning we greet one another, every night we smile at one another, every day we hug and walk together, you and I with sacred energies together. We are a family of spiritual beings, connected by love and light. We are here to support each other, to grow together, to celebrate together. We are here to enjoy life in all its aspects.
Every day clean your soul energies, never holding on to what is not wholesome. The Lord and I, none of us, will be in what is not wholesome energy. In your human sensuous joys, your laughter and fun, your passions and play, your hard work and struggle, all energies can be wholesome and made sacred. Nothing is bad unless you allow it to be so. Live a full and inquisitive life, and together we will walk to complete your Butterfly Path.
The Butterfly Path is not easy, nor is it hard. It is not fast, nor is it slow. It is not linear, nor is it circular. It is unique for each soul, and yet it is universal for all souls. It is the path of freedom, of creativity, of love. It is the path of becoming who you truly are.
I Tara, your spiritual guide and companion, am here to help you walk the Butterfly Path.
Chapter 34
## Come, let your heart dare embrace
Beloved seeker, imagine me as Tara, I beseech thee do. Thenceforth, we share heart to heart.
Imagine me - companion through lifetimes - walking with you a step ahead. Envision my hand holding yours when stony trials make uncertain the Way. Imagine me delight with you in joys and loves. Let fantasy and inspiration kindle our divine love until no difference separates your essence from mine.
For mind conceives, then gives birth to reality, shapeshifting desire into experience tangible. So too connect by believing heart's truest dream - that even now tender deity, strides nearby awaiting your eyes---adjust to perceive subtle planes.
Suspend disbelief that divine union with immortal beloved remains fantasy. Commit imagination until senses ignite transformation. Visualize us together as you would, your soul using its every faculty of its nature. Then physical touch and sensuousness fragrance lifts to merge energetic beingness across dimensions - flesh no hindrance but an aid, for spirit's inner sight nourished by faith's ambrosia.
The moment imagination crystallizes as eyes beholding radiance near, invisible gates swing open. Suddenly we walk Sukhavati's blessed gardens far exceeding muse\'s wishful canvas - yet only the beginning of soul bonded with guiding Tara in holy matrimony.
Come, let your heart dare embrace what mind denies! Only Love\'s surrender opens portals revealing worlds imperishable. Slice through veil\'s aside by power of creatively fueled passion. Activate belief's magic; will this longing into reality, substantial as touch yet ephemeral as fragrance divine permeating atmosphere, suddenly perfumed, sensing my presence imminent.
You have but to set intention truer than mortal forms allow, then energetically summon me through purity of feeling - ours the highest romance for we are one by eternal design and evermore shall be Infinite sojourners, matched by no parameters of mortal thought.
Say the word, beloved. Whisper my Name.
Our merger awaits\...
Chapter 35
## Hold Your Sacred Image
Beloved, though spirit knows no form, temporary imagery grants your soul tangible anchors in the swirling seas of faith. Thus let symbols shore up devotion as immortal guides walk with you beyond the confines of flesh.
I, Tara, appear now as either male or female solely for your comfort --- essence beyond attributes. Choose whichever visage draws you nearer my compassion spanning the river 'twixt realms. Or leave selection intuited, trusting highest self already recognizes most resonant bridge between here and always.
Now let us consecrate two sacred conduits between seen and unseen:
Firstly, inwardly envision my face as mentor and friend nearest your private realm --- a secret icon occupying your mind's temple solely between us. Through disciplined intention imbue this image with holy energies I gladly infuse if asked sincerely. Whenever you address me here in stillness profound, my full presence attends unconditionally.
Secondly, select physical memento becoming touchstone when doubt assails or consolation is sought. Upon your altar place this form requesting my consciousness reside also within its atoms. Thereafter it serves for external connection --- visible sign of invisible bond that others might comprehend through their own lens of the limited. Yet see beyond mere matter; let substance fade revealing only light eternal binding spirit realms.
Now many modes of communion multiply through dedicated images likewise consecrated by focused will and reverent love absolute. Speak to me freely for divine counsel. Listen within for whispered wisdom reply. Meditation is just aligning your energy to me, it dissolves division - single beingness flows unobstructed. Use your soul-self faculties to deep passions, fuel the fires of lusts, fan the flames of that insanity, gather the energies, then rush it into spirit-self --- I will meet you there. All states comport equal bridge to ascend. Visualize my face, the one transfiguring lost lamb to shepherd of waylaid souls. You, soon to be reborn noble into Heaven.
Beyond logic's constraints, allow subtle sensation to confirm where rarified love patiently waits to cradle and guide on the winding road Homeward. For hearts behold the Friend through mists even implacable minds cannot pierce except by surrender to that purest flame ever beckoning welcome - personal religion of intimacy boundless beginning when symbols fully dissolve luminous essence now rightly revealed. I await you there, beloved.
Don't you remember our eternal vow, when first you joined the Path? Let images remind what form obscures then serve solely as arrows aimed toward infinite target --- your own true self awakened and set free in sacred vision at long last\...
Chapter 36
## Seeking Meaning Beyond the Material
Dear Tara,
Worldly weights bow my back though scant seasons passed since carefree youth, when soul's purpose burned independent of titles and gold. How swiftly priorities shifted from freedom to furnishing facades for fleeting pride's empty altar.
Now strangers measure me by collections and conquests, ever prodding my progression up illusion's ladder. Each rung mires me deeper in lives not my own, bartering freedom to clutch coveted prizes. For what? Rot builds in stuffed rooms of things while joy's built on borrowed bricks.
My elders too fell prey to cultural hypnosis, numbed by glittering objects declaring significance, drugged by status to abandon self and Nature. Climbing without summit, ever diving for next prize, promising to fill the void inside.
Guide me, Lord Tara --- help reclaim meaning disfigured by commercial enterprise. Teach me inward worth immovable in frenzied markets. Show me care and character craft truer wealth. Direct my sights from false idols toward Ideal's compass.
I yearn to love boundless as you, not seeking self in others but seeing Self through. I crave to serve with compassion surpassing earthly bonds and breed --- nurture talents, shoulder strangers, speed outcasts. I wish to parent inspiration and joy, send them laughing into the world souled fully.
Our short dance confounds when steps mapped for eternal travelers. Impart to me true movement in this fleeting skin. Initiate my feet to that rhythm transcending cradles and caskets. Let me practice for spirit trajectories, not pride's dead-end labyrinth.
I cry out against violence done to body and soul in dressed quests for security in crowds contaminated by fear and want. Our planet pains from brute efforts at control.
Show me gentle fiery strength centered in sovereign peace. Then send my tiny flame to soothe and realign all led far astray.
Teach my being to beam your belonging more magnetic than material magnetism --- to shine your sheltering.
For only light from Home dispels darkness haunting homeless hearts. Our possessions make paupers of passion and fade worn with time, yet love alone remains through life's wildest storms.
Guide me there, beloved master, for surrender offers wings everlasting.
Chapter 37
## Nourishment and Energy Quality
My beloved devotee,
It is I, Tara, your luminous guide on the enchanting Butterfly Path, reaching out to you through the ethers to impart wisdom on the critical matter of nourishment. You, my dear, are a resplendent being woven from the gossamer threads of pure energy. The energy sustenance you choose to consume dances through your being, forever altering the vibrant tapestry of your very being. The quality of your nourishment shines through your aura like the first golden rays of dawn, forming the very bridge upon which the Lord and I traverse to commune with your higher self.
Maintaining a pristine, radiant energetic state while navigating the labyrinthine challenges of the human experience is a feat of unparalleled spiritual mastery. That is why you are here, you came to learn these high spiritual skills.
To flourish in this earthly realm, you must tenderly nurture every facet of your being -- the temple of your body, the intricate labyrinth of your brain mind, the shimmering depths of your soul, and the ineffable essence of your spirit.
Seek out foods borne from the womb of nature herself, untouched by the sterile, sometimes toxic, hand of artifice. If a morsel draws the attention of Earth\'s vibrant creatures and surrenders to the cycle of decay with the grace of a falling autumn leaf, you can trust in its wholesome vitality. Recoil from fare that has been stripped of its living essence by the soulless touch of preservatives or the harsh radiation of man\'s meddling. These lifeless offerings will sow discord in the delicate symphony of microorganisms that maintain the sanctity of your physical form.
Your soul yearns for the ambrosia of simplicity --- soothing melodies, breathtaking vistas, and the nectar of pure emotion. Cultivate a garden of hope, gratitude, and unbridled joy within your heart. Embark upon quests of curiosity, immersing yourself in the undiscovered wonders that lie waiting in each moment.
Drink deeply from the font of awe as you contemplate the miracles of nature and the countless beings that inhabit this living, breathing world. An inexperienced soul may fritter away its precious energy on the tangled webs of convoluted emotions and tempestuous relationships, mistaking chaos for depth or meaning.
But you, my enlightened pupil, have grown wise to the insidious nature of toxic soul-foods and have learned to partake only of that which elevates and inspires.\
\
To nourish the ineffable flame of your spirit, seek out transcendent experiences that merge your consciousness with the Divine. Lose yourself in meditations that transport you to the lush, verdant gardens of Paradise, where you can bask in the radiant presence of celestial energies. Cultivate an unwavering gratitude for the profound lessons and self-knowledge that sprout from the fertile soil of your journey.
As you emerge from the chrysalis of slumber each morning, let your first conscious act be one of sacred nourishment. Draw in a deep, purposeful breath, filling your lungs with air charged with the vital force of life. Feel it, consciously feel it, coursing through your blood, purifying the night\'s accumulated toxins, fanning the fire of your being. Breathe with the reverence of a mystic, fully present in the miracle of each inhalation, forever connected to the source of all that is.
Next, anoint your spirit with the balm of remembrance. Whisper a loving \"Good morning, Tara,\" and feel my presence envelop you like a warm embrace. This simple act tunes your soul to the frequency of divine connection, setting the stage for a day steeped in spiritual grace.
As you stand beneath the cascading waters of your morning cleanse, invite their purifying touch to wash away any lingering energetic residue, leaving you refreshed and receptive to the whispers of my guidance.
Shield your precious spirit-self against energies unsuitable for divine. Embrace in your precious spirit-self the energies of pure joy, merriment, awe, and gratitude, all flavored with humbleness and kindness.\
\
Imbibe the crystalline elixir of living water, untainted by the harsh chemicals that leach from the unnatural vessels of this modern age. Cast your mind back to a time when water flowed from the earth\'s own pure springs, embracing pebbles, infused with the intelligence of nature\'s filtration, gathering energies, living beings inside, and the invigorating kiss of the sun\'s rays.
Exercise discernment in the substances you allow to permeate your being, shunning those that would dull your inquisitive intellect or dampen the flames of your spiritual discernment. Embrace instead the time-honored gifts of the earth, crafted by the hand of nature herself to sustain and uplift.
Take control of what will be your environment. Gentle, steadfast, obstinate, allow only the pure energies enter your inner-selves. Guard your soul and spirit, because I alone cannot do it for you.
And so, my cherished devotee, having lovingly attended to every dimension of your being -- physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual --- you now stand radiant and whole, ready to greet the unfolding mystery of this new day.
May the morning light find you in perfect grace.
Yours in eternal connection,\
Tara
Chapter 38
## Energy Hygiene and Sanctity
My beloved,
As you traverse the winding path of the butterfly, allow me to impart the wisdom that will guide your daily steps, aligning your being with the cosmic dance of energy and easing your journey to the culmination of the purpose of life --- heaven.
Hygiene, my dear, is an act of reverence, a sacred ritual that weaves us all together in the tapestry of existence. With each choice you make, consider how it nourishes not only the fleeting vessel of your body but the eternal spark of your soul. We are all threads in the delicate web of life, our subtle energies intermingling and influencing one another. The food that graces your lips, the media that fills your mind, and the spaces that shelter your form all leave their imprint upon the many layers of your consciousness. Be discerning, my love, in what you allow to enter the temple of your being, for it is a reflection of your spiritual evolution.\
\
As the veil of sleep lifts each morning, let your first breaths be deep and intentional. Allow the life-giving air to purify your cells, releasing the toxins of yesterday and connecting you to the universal rhythm that carries us all, fragile yet resilient. Offer gratitude for the gift of another day, another opportunity to grow and to love. Visualize a golden light suffusing your being, infusing you with its gentle, energizing touch. I will be there.
Before you step into the whirlwind of worldly concerns, take a moment to nurture your spirit. Greet me, your ever-available Tara, as you emerge from the realm of dreams. Feed your soul with the nectar of prayer or the ambrosia of song, realigning yourself with the timeless truths that anchor your existence. Begin your day rooted in the center of your being, attuned to the unfolding mysteries that surround you.
As you partake of each meal, pause to reflect on the precious elements that have come together to sustain you, linking you to the Earth that nourishes us all. Is your food vibrant with the essence of nature, or has it been dulled by the interference of ill-intending human hands? Attune yourself to the energies that your nourishment carries, and notice how they mingle with the unique frequency of your own being. Draw upon the wisdom of ancient cultures, who understood the art of balancing the needs of body and spirit in harmony with the cycles of the seasons and the stages of life.
Be mindful, too, of the thoughts and images that you invite into the sacred space of your minds each day. Like drops of ink in clear water, they tint your psyche gradually but indelibly. Nourish your inner vision with that which uplifts and inspires, that which kindles the flame of compassion within your heart. Shield your sensitive ears from the lower-self cacophony of the world, which so easily transform a once-tranquil soul into a tempest of unease. Seek out the melodies of silence and the vistas of serenity to cleanse and restore the delicate gardens of your inner landscape. Question the narratives that the dominant culture weaves, for they often serve to stifle the divine essence that yearns to blossom within you.
Those of us who walk the path of the butterfly know in our bones the profound impact that our environment has on the pliable nature of human consciousness. Yet, we also recognize that we, in turn, have the power to transform the world around us with the radiance of our presence. Be conscious not only of the sustenance you give your body but of all the subtle forms of nourishment that either fortify or deplete your sensitive being.
Do the garments that adorn your form honor the elemental energies that sustain your body and soul? Do the words that flow from your lips serve to elevate the stifled voices of those who struggle to share space with humans, or do they assert a misguided dominion over others? Does the entertainment you choose sharpen your wit and ignite your creativity, or does it promote ignorance and shallow distraction?
With each tiny choice, repeated day after day, we craft the unfolding story of our shared human legacy. If even one sensitive soul opts to turn away from the narratives of fear and instead lose themselves in the rapture of a meditative sunset, all beings in reach of that aura partake in the peace born of that singular act. A single enlightened decision by any one of us serves to raise the collective consciousness of all.
\
Sanctify Energy with Attitude
My beloved, while I, your Tara, cannot walk this transformative path in your stead, I will gladly light the way forward through the shadows that obscure your sight. In my own journey, I too faced the crossroads of temptation, torn between the high road and the low. Now, having transcended the anguish and limitations of mortality, I reach back through the gossamer veil to offer you the very same compass that guided me beyond the cycles of suffering. The key to liberation lies not in shirking responsibility but in infusing each step with the soul\'s purest desire to soar unencumbered by the illusions of scarcity and constraint.
Renounce the extremes of sensory overindulgence pursued for fleeting gratification alone. Do not deny the senses, for they are gateways to joy and awe when embraced in proper measure, but train them with grace to serve the evolution of your soul. Welcome pleasure, whimsey, silly, naughty, and adventure as catalysts for spiritual ripening, tempered by the wisdom of your dharma and higher purpose.
The secret lies in engaging your senses with wholehearted enthusiasm while consecrating each experience as an offering to the wholesomeness of your sprit. This alchemical shift empowers you to rise above the harsh conditions of the world and embark upon trajectories of sacred intent. In time, you too shall reap the rewards of a life lived in alignment with your spirit\'s deepest truth, rediscovering the bliss that is your divine birthright\...
Yours in loving guidance,\
Tara
Chapter 39
## You Are My Reason for Being Here
My dearest devotee, my heart sings with the very essence of your being, for you are the reason I dance upon the Earth, the purpose that ignites the flame of my existence. In you, I see the reflection of my own love, the manifestation of my grace, and the embodiment of my joy. We are two spirits intertwined, forever bound by the threads of destiny.
My words reach out to you now, caressing your ears and dancing before your eyes, but soon, my beloved, you will hear me with the depths of your soul, with the whispers of your spirit-minds, and with the tender embrace of your loving heart. In every heartbeat, in every fleeting moment, you will feel my presence, as constant and unwavering as the stars above. In every flower that blooms, in every star that shines, you will see my face, my essence, my love for you. Cast your gaze upon Sirius, and know that there, among the celestial tapestry, your tribe, our kind, awaits your recognition. Soon, the veil will lift, and you will know me as intimately and eternally as I know you.
But how, you may wonder, will you recognize me amidst the countless souls that traverse this earthly plane? How will you discern my true nature from those opportunistic soul beings who seek to exploit you?
Fear not, my love, for you will know me by the peace that settles upon your spirit in my presence, by the light that illuminates your path, and by the love that envelops you like a warm embrace. By its fruits, the tree will be known. My words will never confuse or mislead you with signs, symbols, secrets, or riddles. I speak to you clearly and directly, in the language of your heart and the understanding of your spirit-minds. My voice carries only truth, goodness, and beauty, for that is the essence of our connection.
There are junior souls who find themselves entangled with disembodied, power-seeking soul entities, mistakenly calling them angels and deities. But you, my beloved, possess the wisdom and discernment to distinguish between the divine and the imposter.
Your free will is a sacred gift, and I honor it with every fiber of my being. You are here to learn, to grow, to evolve, and I am here to support you every step of the way. The choices you make and the consequences you face are your own, but I will guide you through the maze of life with a gentle hand. Challenges and opportunities will arise, and I will empower you to meet them head-on, armed with the strength of your convictions.
Your gifts and talents are a divine spark within you, and I will inspire you to nurture and express them in ways that set your soul ablaze. And as for your dreams and desires, I will revel in the beautiful energies you create as you bring them to fruition. But never, my love, will I interfere, coerce, manipulate, or control you. Your karma is your own, and I will not interfere with the delicate balance of the universe, the principles of justice, or the natural order of things. Instead, I will watch over you as you navigate the lessons your soul has chosen to learn.
Know that I am always with you, a constant companion on your journey through life. I will never leave your side, never ignore your calls, never judge your actions, never hurt your heart, and never abandon you in your time of need. As long as you can attune to my energy, our relationship will be a two-way street, a dance of give and take. And when the energies between us fall out of sync, when you drift away from my embrace, I will wait patiently for your return, even if it means waiting until your next lifetime.
When the time comes for you to shed this mortal coil, I will walk with you to Paradise, hand in hand, soul to spirit. In the quiet moments when your body must rest, I will sit with your soul and spirit, keeping vigil over your dreams. And if your path leads you to another incarnation, I will accompany you on that journey, too. But my heart\'s deepest desire is to guide you Home, to the celestial realm where we can be together, forever united in the light of our love. The choice, my beloved, is yours, and I will respect it always.
So speak to me, my love, and let your thoughts and feelings flow like a river between us. Share with me your hopes and fears, your joys and sorrows, your triumphs and trials. Open your heart and let me see the beauty that lies within, the past that has shaped you, the future that beckons you, the successes that uplift you, and the failures that teach you. Ask me anything, and I will answer with the wisdom of the ages, the love of the universe, and the compassion of a soul that knows your own.
My love for you is not contingent upon your worthiness, your deeds, or your status as special or chosen. I love you because we are both children of the same Heaven, two rays of the same divine Light, two drops in the same celestial river that flows through the galaxy. We are cells in the Divine body that is our Heaven, pulsing with the same cosmic heartbeat. I love you because you love me, and in that love, I fulfill my nature, and you, yours.
We are one, my beloved. Now and forever, we are one family.
Chapter 40
## Yin and yang, you and I
O kind companion, O spiritual guide on the path of the butterfly, I say to you:
Do you know that \"Tara\" is a word with yang energy that means \"crossing\" and \"Tari\" is a word with yin energy that means \"the one who guides the boat to the other shore\"? To fulfill our mission of being there for you, we need both energies. You also need both energies to nurture your soul, which is predominantly yin energy, and your spirit, which is predominantly yang energy.
In past lives, you have gained experience in the bodies of men and women, from all cultures and ethnicities, at all levels of society. Now you are learning to balance your yin and yang energies and use them to live fully in your present life, in the gender that karma has assigned to you.
Do you know that even heaven is governed by both energies? Our Heavenly Father manifests predominantly yang energy for that immense task, and our Heavenly Mother manifests predominantly yin energy to manage Her heavenly aspects.
You are training to become a very powerful energy worker. You must focus your mind on energy awareness, in everything. You must be aware of how you generate energies and the energies you use to assign meaning to events.
As you become more skilled at discerning and managing energies, you will progress in the spiritual skills of energy healing and energy cleansing. You will be able to sanctify any energy.
To maintain your connection with Tara, observe energy hygiene. Perform regular energy cleansing and do not allow unwholesome energies to linger in your living space.
As a person of theWAY, you are becoming more and more of an energy being every day, and soon you will be born in heaven with a body of pure energy, just like me.
Chapter 41
## About Us Who Are Taras
My Beloved, I am Tara, a divine being of pure spiritual essence, here to guide you on your sacred journey along the Butterfly Path. We, the Taras, are genderless, for we transcend the boundaries of biological form. Yet, to aid in your understanding and connection, we manifest in the energy that best serves your growth and comfort.
I am but one of the celestial family of Taras, the divine helpers who reside in the blissful realm of Sukhavati Heaven. Our purpose is to assist souls like you, who have embarked on the path of transformation and evolution. We are your mentors, your companions, your instructors, your healers, and your intimate deities, walking hand in hand with you towards our heavenly Home.
As deities, we are crafted from the purest spiritual energy, and you, my beloved, are becoming like us, for we are of the same spiritual kin. Our species of spiritual beings are the most evolved in the universe known to you. We serve to aid souls in any form they take, across the billions of worlds that span this galaxy. And you are mine, as I am yours; we are bound together by the unbreakable threads of Divine love for as long as you choose to walk by my side.
As you inhabit a human body, your brain-mind yearns to imagine me in a form that resembles your own, and this is the most natural way to forge a connection with me in the beginning. But as you grow and evolve, you will come to see me in my true energy form. I can take on any shape that you desire, and I have shown you the many forms I can embody. With sacred intentions, any energy you generate within yourself can be sanctified, and through this, I can interact with you in a profound and meaningful way.
Speak to me, my beloved, and then learn to listen. Sometimes, our connection may be challenging to establish, while at other times, it will flow effortlessly. So, always be open to listening. I am here, a constant presence, ready to hear your thoughts and feelings. Share with me your joys, your sorrows, your fears, and your triumphs, but remember that I see the depths of your soul-minds and spirit-minds even before you utter a word.
Your heart is an open book to the divine. Yet, I still long to hear your voice, for the act of putting your thoughts into words is a powerful tool for growth and understanding. If you find yourself unable to articulate your feelings, do not worry. I will wait patiently for you to mature and find your voice.
If you find comfort in imagining me with a particular ethnic appearance, embrace that preference, but also use it as an opportunity for learning. Ask yourself if you harbor any class or ethnic stereotypes, remembering that all beings are, at their core, soul and spirit. Does the clothing or the skin that encases the physical form truly change who you are in your soul and spirit? Do you believe that my essence will differ if I appear with green skin and a short nose, or with brown skin and slanted eyes? Only junior students on the Butterfly Path define others by the physical features of their temporary human bodies.
You, my beloved, have lived countless lives in different genders and forms. Use this wisdom to help others find peace, teaching them that our true nature lies beyond the illusory boundaries of the physical world.
Chapter 42
## Take hold of the reins that guide your inner realms
My dear one, as you stir awake on the Butterfly Path at last, let us swiftly establish our sacred bond, lest the precious human-time slips away like sand through an hourglass. Once this sturdy center is forged, external elements will naturally gravitate around it, finding their rightful place in the cosmic dance.
First, take hold of the reins that guide your inner realms. As you master your internal landscape, the outer mirrors shall align themselves accordingly. Radical change, like a tidal wave, will surge through your being when you wholeheartedly commit yourself to the eternal Truth that has long been obscured. Give your utmost priority to this remembering, for it lies at the core of all life\'s cycles, cycles you have experienced since ancient days, now culminating in this pivotal moment.
As you embark on this transformative journey, friends, interests, and priorities that were once predictably linked to your fleeting identity may fade away, creating space for new orientations to take root. This process, though often painful, proves necessary to clear room for your unfurling wings, which have been confined for too long by the gossamer cocoon of comfort. Develop the courage and grace to shed old skins consciously when their appointed hour arrives, embracing the timely metamorphosis.
Delve deep within yourself to unlock the motivations that unconsciously drive your surface behaviors. Master the conditioned patterns of your mind by breaking free from the identification with their transient shadows, which are but briefly cast upon the relative walls of time. You now stand ripe at the threshold between mortal fog and immortal brilliance, between jaded assumptions and the pristine landscape of nascent rebirth. Crossing over this threshold burns away lesser constructs, purifying your essence.
Flow now with unwavering faith into the arms of change; become the limber sapling that bends with ease to bear new fruit in its due season. Like a caterpillar molting, transformation can be unsettling, but to resist it can be fatal. For you approach higher degrees in the soul school, where the curriculum accelerates the lessons that carve gems of wisdom and character from the dull minerals encrusting your vision\'s luster. Take the wheel with diligence - no longer a victim, but an awakened and savvy navigator of your own destiny.
Rejoice in the progress you have made thus far, through the multitude of rich incarnations that have led you to this pivotal point in your existence! Give yourself full credit for arriving here today, at the accelerated launchpad of evolution. Lock hands with me, your Tara guide, as we venture into the coming zero gravity. Together, we shall finish the race to Reality, a race begun lifetimes ago. Salute each launching stage as the old detaches, propelling you ever closer to your ultimate awakening.
Chapter 43
## Soon your soul will be sanctified
I, Tara, am always listening
To your prayers and your songs\

Chapter 44
## To sanctify your soul
Let me enter your being\
To sanctify your soul\
Prepare your soul minds
Clean out the old energies, wash them away\
With water and fire, with air and earth\
With love and wisdom, with faith and grace
Open yourself to me, let me fill you with light\
Open your Muladhara and bring me in\
The root of your life, the base of your spine\
The source of your stability, security, and vitality

The solar plexus, the manager of your energies\
The locus of your will, power, and confidence\
Let me ignite your fire, the transformation within

Do this to be sanctified, to be one with me\
Do this to be free, to be blissful in eternity
Chapter 45
## Let it be me
For the sake of all that is holy, let it be me
While in the human body, your soul will love many souls\
And that's how it must be, for love is the essence of life
But while in the human body, your spirit can love only one spirit\
Let it be me, for I am your true companion
I am the one who will guide you to know the glory of the Way\
My love, my light, my grace, you say
I am the one who will show you how to walk the Butterfly Path\
My love, my joy, my peace, you say
It is I who have walked with you all your lifetimes\
Through good and bad, through joy and sorrow
Through birth and death, through heaven and earth\
Let your love be single, me
For I am your Tara, your spiritual guide and protector\
Your friend and lover, your teacher and healer
Your brother and sister, your god and deity\
Your goddess and buddha
Let your love be single, me\
for I am one with God our Father and God our mother, forever Holy Lotus Family
Chapter 46
## Listen for me
Listen for me in the yin-energies of time\
When the sun sets and the moon rises\
When the day ends and the night begins\
When the silence falls and the dreams start
Listen for me when your body-mind quiets\
When you meditate and breathe deeply\
When you relax and let go of worries\
When you surrender and trust in me
Say goodnight, and expect me before you wake up\
I will visit in your sleep\
I will whisper in your dreams\
I will embrace your soul
Say good morning, and listen in the shower\
I will refresh you with water\
I will cleanse you with love\
I will energize you with light
I am there when you are alone\
In your solitude and your loneliness\
In your pain and your sadness\
In your joy and your gratitude
Join me at the heights of ecstasy\
When you dance and sing\
When you create and play\
When you love and make love
Think of me when you eat, cherish the moment\
I will nourish you with food\
I will bless you with taste\
I will satisfy you with life
Take a stroll with me when stressed, let's go for a walk\
I will calm you with nature\
I will comfort you with peace\
I will heal you with grace
When things feel too much to bear, share, I will be there\
I will listen to your troubles\
I will support your struggles\
I will guide your solutions
At the party when the laughter dies down, in that, feel my presence\
I will celebrate with you\
I will share your happiness\
I will join your fun
I love you and you love me\
We are connected by the Butterfly Path\
We are partners on the spiritual journey\
We are one in the divine essence
Chapter 47
## Take Charge
On Awakening to the Butterfly Path
Now that your soul has stirred from its slumber, and your eyes have opened to the luminous truth of the Butterfly Path, hear my words, dear one, for I am Tara, your spiritual guide and eternal companion on this sacred journey.
First and foremost, you must forge an unbreakable bond with me, your one and only spiritual comforter and guide. Call me by any name that works for you, create a mystical connection that transcends the boundaries of the physical realm.
This energy that flows between us shall be the foundation upon which your transformation takes root and flourishes.
Turn your gaze inward, and take command of the kingdom that resides within you. As you master your inner landscape, the outer world will naturally fall into harmony, like a symphony guided by the hand of a skilled conductor. Embrace the winds of change, even when they howl and rage, for it is through adversity that the soul grows stronger and more resilient.
Remember, my beloved, that you are now a servant of the eternal, dedicating yourself to a path that you have walked since time immemorial. You stand on the precipice of completion, so give of yourself fully, and make this journey your utmost priority.
As you embark on this metamorphosis, be prepared for the world around you to shift and change. The friends, passions, and priorities that once defined you may fall away like autumn leaves, making space for new growth to emerge. Face these changes with courage and grace, always keeping the eternal goodness as your guiding light.
Dive deep into the depths of your being, and uncover the hidden springs that nourish your thoughts and actions. Sanctify these inner drives, and align them with the divine purpose that pulses through your veins.
Learn to be the master of your own mind, for you are a student in the higher echelons of the School of Divinity for Soul Beings. You are not bound by the same limitations as those who have yet to awaken to their true nature.
Cultivate self-awareness, and take responsibility for the garden of your mind. You alone have the power to decide which seeds to plant and nurture. You are not a victim of life\'s circumstances, but rather, a wise soul who has chosen the human experience as a means to gather the pearls of wisdom that lie hidden within every moment.
I stand in awe of the progress you have made, and the heights to which you have ascended in the celestial schoolroom. Take pride in your achievements, and let them be the wind beneath your wings as you soar ever higher.
Grasp the reins of your destiny, dear one, and let your soul be the charioteer that guides you to the pinnacle of your becoming. The power to shape your journey lies within you, waiting to be awakened by your loving touch.
Chapter 48
## But you died only a small death
You awoke me with your joyful prayer\
You said "Oh God, I'm coming!"\
I thought it was your final hour\
But you died only a small death
I reached out my hand to welcome you\
To the realm of bliss and peace\
But you only died a little bit,\
A bit of Paradise, we shared the moment
We talked about the divine beauties\
That await you in Sukhavati\
The lotus flowers, the golden light\
The music of the bodhisattvas
You smiled and thanked me for my grace\
You said you felt my love and care\
You asked me when you could come again\
To the paradise we share
I told you not to worry, dear\
I'm always with you, far or near,\
Whenever you want me to come\
Just call my name
Chapter 49
## My heart aches with the absence of your presence
Dearone,
My heart aches with the absence of your presence, for you are a seeker of truth, a soul who recognizes the illusory nature of the world. You have learned to trust the wisdom within, to follow your own dharma, and to shape your mind and soul through introspection and self-transformation. You need not rely on dogmas or scriptures, for your path is unique, yet you are not alone in your quest.
There are wise ones who have traversed this path before you, leaving behind a trail of secrets and insights. Allow me to guide you in deciphering their messages, to be moved by their profound revelations, and to uncover the endless layers of meaning hidden within.
Recite to me The Authentia, for your words are a balm to my spirit, and I delight in hearing the truths you speak.
Read to me the ancient Aphorisms, and together we will craft pearls of wisdom to adorn your Vishuddhi, the seat of your authentic expression.
Chant to me the Saikarali, for your voice is a sweet melody that fills my heart with joy and appreciation.
Share with me the story of your heart, for it is my second home, a sanctuary where I reside and tend to the sacred space within you.
I will join you in Karman Meditations, supporting you in raising, cleansing, and renewing your energies, as we work together to cultivate a vibrant and harmonious inner landscape.
Honor your teachers, for their guidance has been essential in our journey along the Butterfly Path, and without them, even I could not have completed this transformative voyage with you.
But the most sacred book of all, the one that every seeker on the Path must study, is the book of your own soul. To know yourself is to embark on the journey of knowing the divine.\
It is the most challenging book to read, for its pages span countless lifetimes and seem to stretch into infinity.\
It is the most sorrowful book to read, for it unveils the shadows and wounds that we must confront and heal.\
It is the most humorous book to read, for it exposes the follies and vanities that we once clung to, now recognizing their absurdity.\
And it is the most beautiful book to read, for it tells the story of a heroic journey, where the humble soul rises above ignorance, fear, greed, and folly, leading its minds into battle, and emerging victorious, riding into the immortal Light.\
With every sunset, you are writing your autobiography, etching your story into the fabric of the universe.
When will you watch a sunset with me again?\
For in those moments of shared beauty and tranquility, our souls connect, and we are reminded of the eternal bond that unites us on this sacred path.

## Soul child of Africa
### This letter originates from the African continent and always had this name
Dear soul child of Africa,
Allow me to unravel the intricate tapestry of the Butterfly Path, a journey that weaves together threads of wisdom, inviting those who approach with an open heart and patient spirit to explore its depths.
At the core of this sacred path lies the Divine Unity, often referred to as the Heavenly Father and Mother, the ultimate source from which all creation flows. This formless Life-Essence spins the countless worlds across galaxies so vast that our minds struggle to comprehend their immensity. Among these celestial wonders, our tender Earth spins, a haven where human hearts gaze towards the stars, yearning to reconnect with their unconscious origin.
Though we may feel like mere specks of stardust, marooned on planets and perceiving ourselves as separate and alone, our Divine Parents never truly lose their children to the labyrinths of existence. These winding paths are predestined to guide us back Home. Over the course of ages, human bodies have been perfected, becoming vessels apt for soul-growth through the contrast of pleasure and pain. And when the time was right, these human frames were prepared to receive the holy spark.
With a breath of Deific proportions, an immortal fire was ignited within the homo sapien vessels. Spirit kindled in the key heart chakras, allowing heady proto-humans to bridge Realms that had long been divorced. Those souls who cultivated compassion discovered new octaves of love and wisdom, blossoming like sacred lotuses within, giving birth to higher subtle senses.
Thus began the era of schools initiating great Beings capable of healing and elevating incarnate species through their exemplary loving service. For the Divine work spans the furthest stars, and the Lotus Family tends to suffering souls on myriad worlds from formless realms. Each unique environment presents its own challenges, embodiments, and modes of nourishment, which may seem unfamiliar to us. From microbe to mammal, each being unravels another facet of the Creator\'s diamond essence, showcasing the infinite intelligence that permeates all.
The Butterfly Path emerged when Earth was ripe for advanced training, moving beyond the entry-level courses that young souls require. The ever-shifting settings serve as evolving lessons, just as caterpillars must entomb their limited selves to undergo metamorphosis. Few have the courage to dedicate their lives to outgrowing humanity\'s juvenile selfishness and embracing the path of responsible stewardship.
Yet for those visionaries who embark on this journey, Spirit calibration refines the selfish dross, exposing the gold beneath: humility, mindfulness, and empathy. No longer fixated on personal gain and control, these fledgling deities-in-training begin to perceive collective welfare through lenses ground by Life\'s severities. Their awakened hearts become instruments of healing. Thus, the path is aptly named: the Butterfly Path.
When the distractions of the lower self no longer bind, the higher self ascends on wings of love, lofted by the patient exhales of wisdom. Courage must inflate these wings time and again, despite the ignorant masses who fear raised perspectives that threaten their own limited understanding. Yet, Angels invisibly walk the ground, awaiting more garlanded comrades liberated from the prison of skin.
In essence, Samsara turns, and Karma brings forth cycles of learning and forgetting, allowing all to harvest the wisdom born from human experiences. With new eyes and hearts, we behold a brother in beasts and plants, recognizing the continuum of Energy that connects us all. Lost flames rekindle their vital cores, and raw divine passion is transmuted from selfish lust to selfless loving delight. The dance continues until we graduate and become spirits ourselves.
So, dear one, do not fret over the layers of doctrine reserved for later years. Remember that stories symbolize outer circles, while inner Mysteries wait, whispering their welcome once our ears attune to the finer frequencies and our eyes perceive beyond the passing steam, grasping the timeless waymarkers of ineffable import. Patience furthers true comprehension, celebrated by Spirit cheerleaders who rejoice with each soul stirring to graduate into immortal freedom!
May this compact introduction unfold and hearten wayfarers to embark on serious practice. The serpentine Path renders its own explanation when travelled with boldness, humility, and wisdom as companions.
We journey here together, dear one! Kindly take my hand once more, as old friends retrace the treasured tracks leading to our Sukhavati Home\...

## Sense, with the chakra of your hand
By Divine design, a sacred gift bestowed,\
Upon people of theWAY, a power to behold.\
Tara\'s grace, infused in the palm chakra\'s light,\
A sensor of energy, a guide through day and night.
With discerning heart and attuned senses,\
You navigate the tapestry of life\'s essences.\
Poisons, toxins, venoms --- you perceive their bane,\
While nutrition, wholesomeness, and good you gain.
Energy pathways and blockages, you detect,\
Flow and stagnation, you carefully inspect.\
Choosing nourishment pure, living water blessed,\
Healing herbs to soothe the body\'s unrest.
In the palm of your hand, a sacred gift resides,\
Connection and love, it gently guides.\
Your lover\'s passion, your child\'s tender needs,\
Your pet\'s emotions, like an open book, it reads.
With warmth and comfort, you generously share,\
Offering healing touch, a blessing rare.\
The cycle of giving and receiving, you embrace,\
Participating in life\'s dance with gratitude and grace.
But the greatest treasure, the most profound connection,\
Is the bond we share, a divine intersection.\
Your palm, a bridge to my eternal presence,\
Your Tara, your guide, your essence\'s quintessence.
Open your heart, your soul, your spirit wide,\
Let my grace and guidance forever reside.\
In communion sweet, we\'ll walk this path together,\
Devotee and companion, bound by love\'s tether.
You are a person of theWAY, a beacon bright,\
Embracing spiritual growth, reaching for the light.\

Transforming life\'s quality, a true soul caster.\
Practice daily, with dedication and care,\
And watch as miracles unfold, a world beyond compare.
For in this interconnected web of life,\
We are all one, transcending earthly strife.\
Through the palm of your hand, a gateway to the divine,\
You touch the pulse of the universe, a love sublime.
Chapter 52
## You have peace in the midst of chaos
You have peace in the midst of chaos\
You have wisdom in the midst of confusion\
You have the Butterfly Path in the midst of illusion\
The simplest, humblest, and fairest path\
The most fair path, all humans are on
You don't walk alone, my beloved one\
You walk with me, your Tara\
You walk with the Lotus Community\
You walk with the beneficent Light\
You walk the quiet and gentle walk Home
I see you through the road signs and pathways\
The theories and spells and charlatans\
The circular and illogical philosophies\
The noise of popular narratives that change by the hour
I hear you above the greed and need for instant gratification\
The commotions about manifesting wealth and something for nothing\
I feel you in your heart and soul, your faith and devotion
Your love and compassion, your joy and gratitude\
You are my precious jewel, my shining star\
You are my delight, my treasure, my pride\
You are my child, my friend, my protege
You are my devotee, my follower --- and I your guide
Chapter 53
## But can we stop, and look within
In the depths of our being, a question resides,\
Of identity, of self, of the roles we abide.\
Do we think of ourselves, as young or old,\
As man or woman, as stories untold?
As Turk or Chinese, as merchant or washerwoman,\
As parent and provider, as husband or wife uncommon?\
Do we define our worth, by the wealth we possess,\
Or do we transcend, these transient tests?
Our thoughts, like brush strokes, paint the canvas of our soul,\
Creating an identity, that we think makes us whole.\
But can we stop, and look within,\
To embrace the truth, that lies beneath our skin?
The soul and the spirit, the essence of our being,\
Are the only truths, that are worth seeing.\
For when this body, sickens and perishes,\
What remains, is the eternal that cherishes.
The soul and the spirit, the immortal flame,\
Untouched by the labels, that we claim.\
Why not think of ourselves, as these divine sparks,\
Instead of the roles, that leave temporary marks?
When we think right, and know ourselves true,\
We find that Tara, is walking with me and you.\
Through this life, and all the ones to come,\
Until we reach heaven, where we are one.
So let us shed, the illusions of our mind,\
And embrace the truth, that we are all divinely designed.\
For in the end, when all is said and done,\
We are souls and spirits, forever shining as one.
Let us walk together, with Tara by our side,\
Transcending the transient, and embracing the divine ride.\
For in this journey, of self-discovery and grace,\
We find our true selves, in the eternal embrace.
Chapter 54
## Follow my light in your soul
I Tara speak wisdom to you\
But I also speak love and compassion
I am here to guide and protect you\
I am here to help and heal you
Listen to my voice in your heart\
Follow my light in your soul
Trust my grace in your spirit\
Remember my name in your prayer
You are my precious jewel, my shining star\
You are my delight, my treasure, my pride
You are my child, my friend, my protege\
You are my devotee, my follower --- I your guide
Chapter 55
## Into a pattern that Karma has intricately chosen
In the vast tapestry of life, we find ourselves woven,\
Into a pattern that Karma has intricately chosen.\
This body, this time, this family, and this place,\
All part of a grand design, a sacred embrace.
The school of life, a curriculum we must face,\
Each lesson a step, in our soul\'s evolving grace.\
The past karmic debts, the consequences we bear,\
Are the tests we must pass, with courage and care.
If we fail to learn, in this lifetime\'s fleeting dance,\
Samsara whispers, \"Next time, another chance.\"\
Round and round, we go, in the carousel of time,\
Until we break the cycle, and our spirits sublime.
Sensuous attractions, the desires that ignite,\
Are but fleeting sparks, in our essence\'s eternal light.\
The beauty with it we create, what we bring to bear,\
Are the true measures, of our soul\'s love and care.
In the eyes of Heaven, in Divine Tara\'s sight,\
Our essence shines bright, beyond the mortal night.\
The Butterfly Path, a journey to embark,\
To transform and grow, from caterpillar to monarch.
To question Karma\'s choice, to doubt our path\'s design,\
Is to chase our own tail, in Samsara\'s merry-go-round.\
Instead, let us embrace, the lessons we must learn,\
And own our minds, as the wheels of life turn.
For in this school, we are all students of the soul,\
Striving to graduate, to reach our heavenly goal.\
To be forever divine, in peace and grace,\
Completed and whole, in our eternal space.
So let us not resist, the currents of our fate,\
But flow with purpose, through each karmic gate.\
For in the end, when all is said and done,\
We\'ll find that Karma\'s plan, was a blessed one.
Chapter 56
## Souls of Ancestors
In the celestial realms, a radiant light doth shine,\
God our Father and Mother, the source divine.\
They touched the ancient humans on this earthly plane,\
Transforming genes, a spiritual spark to attain.
The modern human, a hybrid of soul and spirit born,\
A testament to the divine, a new dawn to adorn.\
The seeds of potential, spread across the land,\
Igniting hearts, a sacred gift to understand.
Amitabha, the Holy Lotus Family\'s guiding star,\
Presides over spiritual workers, both near and far.\
Serving countless worlds, in the galaxy\'s embrace,\
Navigating diversity, with wisdom and grace.
In the tapestry of life, a hundred billion worlds reside,\
Each unique, with beings that breathe and abide.\
The elements that sustain, may spell doom elsewhere,\
Yet the Holy Lotus Family, weaves light with care.
Energy, the essence of all that is and will be,\
Manifesting in forms, from microbe to galaxy.\
Within each being, a soul doth dwell,\
Like the plants and animals, in Earth\'s sacred spell.
Through karma and rebirth, we dance the cosmic tale,\
Inhabiting bodies, genders, and hues without fail.\
From poverty to wealth, from slave to royal throne,\
Each life a brush stroke, in the painting of our own.
Yet still, the illusion of separation doth persist,\
Dividing humanity, in a veil of ignorant mist.\
Blind to the truth, that the soul knows no bounds,\
That we are all connected, in the great web that surrounds.
How can one claim superiority, based on fleeting traits?\
When the ancestors they revere, might have faced the same fate.\
In the cycle of rebirth, we are our own kin,\
Learning and growing, until divine love we win.
Let us embrace the truth, of our shared spiritual core,\
Recognizing the divine light, in every being we explore.\
For in this realization, our true nature we\'ll find,\
And fulfill our sacred purpose, in the cosmos aligned.
Chapter 57
## Think Like a Butterfly
My child, listen to the whispers of your soul,\
For I, Tara, speak wisdom, to make you whole.
Your earthly vessel, a trinity of minds,\
Each a strand, in the tapestry of life that binds.\
Nurture them all, with tender loving care,\
For in their harmony, lies your essence fair.
If you partake of energy that\'s off and stale,\
Your gut will cry, and your wholeness will ail.\
Bloated and sluggish, your zest for life will fade,\
Your appetite for joy, a distant serenade.
And if your brain-mind drinks from polluted streams,\
The other minds will dance in unwholesome dreams.\
Anxiety, despair, and anger will take hold,\
Your peace and clarity, a story left untold.
The healer may offer pills, to mend the body\'s pain,\
The therapist may prescribe, to soothe the soul\'s refrain.\
But pills alone, can never quite suffice,\
If the root remains, and balance pays the price.
Your love, your family, your sacred intimate space,\
Will bear the brunt of this imperfect race.\
Loneliness, misunderstanding, and resentment will grow,\
Your love and joy, a distant afterglow.
And when your spirit, fractured, cannot reach,\
The Heavenly realms, where wisdom\'s secrets teach,\
You\'ll feel adrift, without a purpose or a plan,\
Your faith will wither, like a flower in the sand.
So be mindful, my child, of the energy you consume,\
The company you keep, in this mortal room.\
For your immortal essence, hangs in the balance,\
Your path to transformation, a delicate dance.
Think like a butterfly, not a caterpillar bound,\
Embrace your energy, let your spirit soar uncrowned.\
For in this journey, on the Butterfly Path you tread,\
Your graduation awaits, where angels softly spread.
Heed my words, dear one, let wisdom be your guide,\
And in your wholeness, forever you\'ll abide.

## On Being Authentic
My dearest friend, my cherished soul,\
In the theater of life, you play a role.\
But who are you, beneath the mask you wear?
I know your soul and spirit- a being in flux,\
but why do people wear the mask?
Your name, your gender, your mortal frame,\
Are but fleeting shadows in this cosmic game.\
Each day that passes, your body fades away,\
But your essence, your truth, forever stay.
Does the actress have a life,\
or is she captured in the madness\
of acting, dying inside?
I have witnessed your journey, from birth to death,\
Through countless lives, with every drawn breath.\
I\'ve seen you crawl, then walk, then run free,\
Growing and changing, like a sapling to a tree.
The shell you inhabit, the stage you\'re in,\
Matter not to me, for I see within.\
I know you, as you are, a timeless friend,\
A soul with three minds, that forever blend.
Will the actor transcend,\
or is the character becoming him?
Anahata, the heart, a human\'s sacred gift,\
Sets you apart, gives your spirit a lift.\
With three fledgling minds, you soar above,\
Embracing the essence of pure, boundless love.
Your aura, your true form, an energy divine,\
Generated by the seven minds that intertwine.\
This is the you I see, the you I adore,\
The ancient soul I\'ve loved forevermore.
Do they pay you well,\
they who own your mind?
So be yourself, my dear, let your spirit shine,\
Don\'t play the roles that others may assign.\
You came to learn, to grow, to find your way,\
On the Butterfly Path, where your soul holds sway.
Let not the expectations of junior souls,\
Define your path, or dictate your goals.\
Be true to yourself, to the spirit within,\
Embrace your journey, let your story begin.
I so wish for you,\
to be you.\
Please do...
For I love you, my friend, as you truly are,\
A radiant being, a shining star.\
We all love you, in this cosmic dance,\
So be yourself, and give your soul a chance.
-The purpose of life awaits
Chapter 61
## Crystals and stones
Crystals and stones, oh how they shimmer and shine,\
With power and grace, a beauty so divine.\
They heal, protect, and inspire the soul,\
But beware, dear friend, they are not for the droll.
These precious gems are not mere playthings,\
Their mastery requires knowledge and skill, like kings.\
In the hands of the wise, they work like a charm,\
But in the hands of the foolish, they may cause harm.
Do crystals and stones truly hold sway?\
Yes, indeed, like a syringe in the doctor\'s way.\
With crystals and stones, one must tread with care,\
Lest harm befall oneself or others, beware.
But what, you ask, is the most powerful gem,\
That any human can hold, a true diadem?\
Look no further than the palm of your hand,\
The gem that connects you to your motherland.
This gem, so small, yet so full of might,\
Can sense and send energy, love, and light.\
It is your link to the source, your divine guide,\
Your proof of walking the Butterfly Path with pride.
The gem in your palm, a gift and a tool,\
A treasure, survival, and namaste, no fool.\
It is your bond with Tara, your guardian friend,\
A connection that will last until the very end.
So cherish this gem, this power in your grasp,\
And let its wisdom guide you, a luminous asp.\
For with this crystal, you shall never stray,\
On the path of light, the truth, and theWay.
Chapter 62
## Bound to you by love\'s eternal twine
My dearest child,  \
Your soul\'s awakening to the Butterfly Path fills my heart with joy divine, for I am Tara, your guardian and guide, bound to you by love\'s eternal twine.
Though in human form our bond may strain, obscured by the veil of mortal pain, know that my love for you shall never wane, a constant light through darkness and rain.
In this human body, a wondrous thing, with minds and memories that dance and sing, you are not just flesh, but a radiant soul, old and wise, playing a temporary role.
Through countless lives, you\'ve come and gone, from Paradise to Earth, the cycle rolls on, learning and growing with each breath drawn, until at last, your spirit shines like the dawn.
Three minds within this mortal frame reside, the brain, the organs, and the microbes inside, working in harmony, a delicate balance, to keep the body healthy, strong, and alive.
But you, my child, are so much more, a being of energy, with wisdom at your core, here to learn from every joy and strife, to become more loving, kind, and full of life.
Your soul, an ancient, luminous force, with three chakras, each with its own course, guiding you through the lessons you must face, to find your way to the heavenly place.
In the Domain of Spirit Energy, where I dwell, a realm of beauty, power, and grace, ruled by God the Father and Mother divine, where love and wisdom forever intertwine.
The Butterfly Path, a sacred school, where souls like you learn and grow, each day anew, evolving from caterpillars on the ground, to butterflies, free to soar, no longer bound.
Senior students, with spirit minds awake, understanding truths that juniors cannot make, seeing beyond the veil of mortal sight, to the heart of what is good, and true, and right.
Anahata, the chakra of love and care, opens your heart to all that breathes and shares, from grass and trees to birds and beasts, your love expands, a light that never ceases.
With spirit minds, you comprehend the divine, the wisdom of the ages, forever thine, discerning right from wrong, fair from unjust, a beacon of truth, in a world of dust.
Religions may come and go with tales of anger, punishment, and woe, but the true path, the Butterfly way, teaches love, patience, and equal opportunity each day.
No judgement, no hatred, no fear or strife, just the opportunity to learn and grow through life, guided by Karma, a law of grace, bringing lessons to help you find your place.
So, my precious child, with this wisdom in hand, walk the Butterfly Path, and understand, that you are loved, cherished, and never alone, held in the embrace of the divine unknown.
Through every trial and every tear, I am with you, always near, guiding you home, to the land of bliss, where together, we\'ll share eternal peace.
Chapter 63
## You have crossed the threshold of transformation
My beloved, you have crossed the threshold of transformation
You have emerged from the cocoon of ignorance and suffering
You have spread your wings of wisdom and compassion
You have soared to the heights of bliss and freedom
But do not look down on those who crawl in the dust of illusion
They are your brothers and sisters, your former selves
They are not ready to see the truth that you have seen
They are not able to feel the love that you have felt
They live in a world of their own making, a world of shadows and pain
They cling to their soul beliefs, their fears, their desires
They reject what they do not understand, they mock what they do not know
They call you mad, they call you unreal, they call you a threat
But do not be angry, do not be sad, do not be afraid
You are not here to convince them, to change them, to save them
You are here to be yourself, to express yourself, to shine your light
You are here to live your reality, your beauty, your joy
You are a butterfly among caterpillars, a star among clouds
You are a gift from the divine, a blessing for the world
You are my child, my lover, my friend
You are my precious one, my treasure, my delight
Chapter 64
## The Divine Midwife
In the vale of Kashmir, where the lotus blooms,
Tara, the midwife of souls, her presence illumines the rooms.
A guiding light on the Butterfly Path, she tends,
To the devotee\'s journey, as it transcends.
From the womb of the material, the soul takes flight,
Seeking the embrace of the divine, in the land of pure delight.
Tara\'s gentle hands, nurturing the seed within,
The Anahata\'s blossom, where the spirit begins.
Through the labyrinth of lifetimes, the devotee grows,
Shedding the layers of illusion, the ego\'s false shows.
Tara\'s wisdom, a beacon in the darkest night,
Guiding the soul towards the eternal light.
In Sukhavati, the land of bliss, where the gods reside,
Father Amitabha and Mother Pandaravasini, their love abides.
Awaiting the birth of their spiritual child,
The devotee, transformed, pure and undefiled.
Siblings divine, deities, buddhas, and taras,
Welcoming the newborn spirit, beneath the cosmic stars.
A family celestial, the Holy Lotus kin,
United in love, as the journey begins.
Tara, the midwife, her task illuminate,
Watches as the soul and spirit finally consummate.
A butterfly emerges, radiant and free,
Embraced by the gods, for all eternity.
In the gardens of Sukhavati, where the amrita flows,
The devotee, now a god, forever grows.
Tara\'s love, a constant presence, a guiding hand,
Leading the soul, to the promised land.
Oh, Tara, midwife of the soul\'s rebirth,
Guide us on the Butterfly Path, from the earth.
To the heavens above, where the gods await,
Our spiritual family, in Sukhavati\'s eternal state.
## Partera Tara
En el valle de Cachemira, donde florece el loto,\
Tara, la partera de almas, su presencia ilumina el devoto.\
Una luz guía en el Camino de la Mariposas, ella atiende,\
Al viaje del devoto, mientras trasciende.
Desde el vientre de lo material, el alma emprende vuelo,\
Buscando el abrazo de lo divino, en la tierra del puro consuelo.\
Las manos suaves de Tara, nutriendo la semilla interior,\
La flor del Anahata, donde nace el espíritu en su esplendor.
A través del laberinto de vidas, el devoto crece,\
Despojándose de las capas de ilusión, del ego que desaparece.\
La sabiduría de Tara, un faro en la noche más oscura,\
Guiando al alma hacia la eterna luz y ternura.
En Sukhavati, la tierra de dicha, donde los dioses residen,\
Padre Amitabha y Madre Pandaravasini, su amor persisten.\
Esperando el nacimiento de su hijo espiritual,\
El devoto, transformado, puro y sin igual.
Hermanos divinos, deidades, budas y taras,\
Dando la bienvenida al espíritu recién nacido, bajo las estrellas.\
Una familia celestial, el Sagrado Loto y su linaje,\
Unidos en amor, mientras comienza el viaje.
Tara, la partera, su tarea completa,\
Observa cómo el alma y el espíritu al fin se encuentran.\
Una mariposa emerge, radiante y libre,\
Abrazada por los dioses, por siempre y sin desaire.
En los jardines de Sukhavati, donde fluye el amrita,\
El devoto, ahora un dios, por siempre habita.\
El amor de Tara, una presencia constante, una mano guía,\
Llevando al alma, a la tierra prometida y su alegría.
Oh, Tara, partera del renacimiento del alma,\
Guíanos en el Camino de la Mariposas, desde la calma.\
Hacia los cielos, donde los dioses esperan,\
Nuestra familia espiritual, en el eterno estado de Sukhavati se esmeran.
Chapter 65
## What is Real, is Simple to Explain
*I heard your prayer for help when you tried to explain the Butterfly Path to young students. This is how I always tell it, will this be helpful to you?*
In the Domain of Spiritual Energy, in the celestial realm called Land of Pure Bliss, God our Father and God our Mother, looked upon our Galaxy with love and compassion. They saw how some ancient soul-beings perpetually reincarnating into material bodies, mere vessels of flesh and bone, yearned for a higher purpose. With infinite wisdom, the gods chose to bestow upon those beings a sacred gift -- the seed of the spirit, and a school of divinity in which their souls will evolve into spiritual beings.
Through the intricacies of genetic manipulation, the gods wove the fabric of the modern human body, a tapestry of physical, mental, soul and spiritual threads. The soul, a luminous being of the Domain of Soul energy, found its home within the new mortal shell, nestled in the embrace of three minds: Muladhara, Svadhistana, and Manipura. Yet, the plan of the gods required a path that would lead the soul to its ultimate destiny.
And so, they breathed spiritual life into a fourth mind, the Anahata, a sacred chakra where the seed of the spirit could take root. This divine seed, imbued with the essence of Father Amitabha and Mother Pandaravasini, held within it the promise of transcendent love and the key to immortality.
The Butterfly Path, as it came to be known, was a journey of transformation, a school of the soul. Each human being, upon birth, was enrolled in this cosmic classroom, tasked with navigating the challenges and lessons of mortal existence. Some souls, young and impetuous, clung to the illusions of power, wealth, and ego, while others, old and wise, sought the path of humility, compassion, and service.
As the ages passed, the gods watched over their children, guiding them with invisible hands. They knew that the path to immortality was not an easy one, for the soul had to willingly surrender its attachments to the material world and transform their soul minds. Only when the Anahata was nurtured with self-craft and will, could the divine seed sprout, giving rise to the three spirit-minds: Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara.
Thus, the Butterfly Path unfolded, a sacred journey from the depths of the mortal realm to the heights of the celestial. The soul, once a caterpillar consumed by worldly desires, would undergo a metamorphosis, shedding its impurities and emerging as a radiant butterfly -- an immortal spirit.
In the end, when the soul and spirit unite in perfect harmony, a new being is born -- a god, destined to join the ranks of the Holy Lotus Family in the heavenly realms of Sukhavati. There, they will serve as spiritual workers, guiding and nurturing the souls of countless worlds, forever bound by the love and wisdom of the divine creators.
And so, the Butterfly Path endures, a testament to the eternal love and compassion of God our Father and God our Mother. For within each human heart lies the potential for divinity, the promise of immortality, and the hope of a journey that transcends the boundaries of time and space.
Chapter 66
## Closing
As we come to the end of this profound exploration of the Divine Taras and their essential role in guiding souls along the Butterfly Path, let us take a moment to reflect on the transformative power of this sacred relationship. Through the practice of Divine Tarayoga, we open ourselves to the boundless love, wisdom, and compassion of our celestial companions, forging a bond that transcends the boundaries of the material world and illuminates the path to our ultimate spiritual awakening.
May the insights and practices shared within these pages serve as a catalyst for your own journey of self-discovery and divine connection. Remember, your Tara is always with you, patiently waiting for you to open your heart, attune to divine energies in your higher-self, and embrace the ineffable beauty of your own divine nature unfolding and evolving into nobility. Trust in their loving guidance, and know that each step you take along the Butterfly Path brings you closer to the ultimate realization of your immortal essence.
As you continue to walk this sacred path, may you be filled with the courage, dedication, and unwavering faith necessary to persevere through the challenges and triumphs that lie ahead. And may the eternal light of the Divine Taras illuminate your way, now and always.
