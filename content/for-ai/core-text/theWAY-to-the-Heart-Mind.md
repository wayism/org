## Ancient Teachings Unique to Wayism
Seekers of Truth traverse the universes of philosophies, religions, and spiritualities to find that which their soul and spirit jump at, grabs hold and wont let go. Always the question comes up, \"What is different about this, that made my ancient soul so happy to rediscover it?\" This book explains the teachings unique, and exclusive to teachings of theWAY.
In the vast tapestry of spiritual traditions, Wayism emerges not only as the very warp and woof of the loom, but its golden shimmering threads weave the original, the quintessential, perennial, tapestry of personal life philosophy and the spirituality which is imbedded in it. Others would embroider upon the ancient frame for their own purposes and religious designs.
The essence of the tapestry of theWAY was woven through the ages, in the ever-changing idioms and cultural idiosyncrasies, its wisdom whispered in the hearts of seekers across time and space.
This book, a humble offering, seeks to distill the core teachings of the nature of being, the purpose of life, the meaning of life, The Absolute, and the Source.
This book about our most ancient Path offers a glimpse into the profound insights and transformative practices that have guided countless souls on their journey of awakening.
Like the delicate flower of Ajna-mind, the book unfolds for two purposes, each petal revealing a layer of wisdom and understanding. The first purpose invites you to step into the uniqueness of garden of Wayism, to immerse yourself in the essential teachings that form the foundation of this wondrous path, teachings that are unlike any other. It is a map, a compass, guiding you to the heart of what it means to be a person of theWAY, to walk in alignment with the eternal truths that underpin this tradition.
But this purpose is more than a mere introduction; it is a mirror, reflecting back to you the essence of your own being. As you explore these teachings, you may find yourself nodding in recognition, a deep sense of resonance stirring within your ancient soul.
For the path of Wayism is not a distant, abstract concept, but a living, breathing reality, woven into the very fabric of your existence. You have crossed its path before; you are an ancient soul and would not be reading this if you weren't. And each time, you embrace more, and appreciate more of the inner teachings. It is again presented to you by your Divine Guide and your karma.
The 'second' purpose, like a chamber hidden from souls clothed in arrogance, reveals the unique inner treasures of Wayism, the precious gems of mystical wisdom that set this path apart from all others. Much of it unspoken, unwritten, because it reflects in the sacred chambers of your higher-self minds where it is distilled to form wisdom, your own deeper understanding of the purpose of life, and your path.
Here, in your inner chambers of developing spirit-minds, you will encounter philosophical and spiritual teachings that have no parallel in other traditions, insights that have been carefully guarded and passed down through the lineages of Wayist masters.
These teachings, like sacred seeds, have the power to transform your entire being, to awaken within you a depth of understanding and realization that you may have never thought possible. They are the keys to unlocking the mysteries of your own spiritual awareness and awakening, to discovering the radiant truth of your own divine nature.
The teaching on paper are the seeds and material which your spirit-minds will distill to extract that wisdom for which you are now ready, and your entire being will drink of that divine nectar. It will change you.
As the poem of Rumi says:
"O heart, drink the wine of the spirit and sleep safe and free.\
When I cut off sorrow's head, I freed myself from pain and grief.\
My heart ascended; my body descended.\
Where does that leave me?\
Neither up nor down."
To make the most of the teachings of theWAY, keep an open mind and be critical in your thinking. Question; don't accept anything simply because it's in the teaching. Ponder it, drink it into your wisdom-self and let it brew. And when you do, as you should, you will either see the wisdom unfold for you, or put the book down and find something that appeals to your philosophical sensibilities and preferred explanations of reality.
Should you continue, however, you will become aware of how your higher-self minds remember, recall, and connect the dots between all religions and theories, and in the end, those lines of connected dots form a sacred metaphysical form, upon which all your newly acquired wisdom is built\--and then, you own it. You made the wisdom; you made it your own.
However, it is crucial to bear in mind that this compact book, although immensely insightful, is merely a fragment in the expansive sea of Wayist knowledge. But not so much of it is written. Think of our texts as distillations, extracting the core teachings and concentrating them, yet acknowledging that it is not the complete body of teaching. The complete teaching, you receive deep inside, in your metaphysical self. Truly, you could dedicate a lifetime to rereading the same few texts, and with each repetition, your comprehension will blossom like layers upon layers, growing richer as you age and contemplate the very same lines of text.
But herein lies the beauty of this path: you need not be a scholar, a master of esoteric texts, to walk in alignment with its truths. Armed with nothing more than the teachings contained within these pages, you can embark on a journey of profound transformation, of deep spiritual awakening, and it will be sufficient to attain Heaven.
For the essence of Wayism is not found in the accumulation of knowledge, knowledge comes to naught when the organic brain sicks and dies. But in the direct experience of existential truth in everyday life experiences. It is a path of the heart mind, a path of embodiment, a practical path we walk day and night simply by being in the human state. A path where the teachings come alive in every moment of your existence.
Whether you are a mystic, a seeker, or simply a human yearning for a deeper understanding of your place in the universe, Wayism offers a doorway, an invitation to step into the light of your own, becoming.
So let this book be your guide, your companion, as you navigate the winding path of your own spiritual journey. Let its words be like a soft rain, gently washing away the veils of illusion, revealing the pristine beauty of your own true nature. And know that, no matter where you are on your path, the wisdom of Wayism is always within reach, always ready to support and guide you on your way.
For in the end, the path of Wayism is the path of coming home, of awakening to the truth of who you are. It is a journey of love, of courage, of surrender, and of ultimate liberation. May these teachings be a beacon, illuminating your way, and may they lead you ever deeper into the heart of your own divine essence.
## A Brief Look at the Butterfly Path
 The teaching of theWAY, or Wayism as it is known to those who speak with the tongue of -isms, weaves a tale both ancient and ever-unfolding. It speaks of senior soul beings, who venture into the realm of human experience, seeking to evolve into immortal spiritual beings.
This, Wayism proclaims, is the singular purpose and meaning of life, the path upon which all humans tread. We are all here, for that purpose. To evolve our souls into another type of being, an immortal spiritual being. We came here to attend the School of Divinity for Soul Beings.
In this school of divinity, known as the Butterfly Path, soul beings from far-flung reaches of our galaxy incarnate as human beings. Here, they share the same space, learning from the tapestry of human experiences over countless lifetimes. theWAY teaches that to graduate and emerge as immortal spiritual beings, these souls must master the spiritual skills and powers of Humility, Simplicity, and Compassion.
The junior students on this path, their souls still tethered to their inherent nature, prioritize power-seeking and resource hoarding. Yet, as they mature, they drift from their lower-self and towards their higher-self, guided by the gentle hand of self-examined life experiences and the wisdoms thereof.
In this campus we call Earth, the junior students always outnumber the seniors, their influence seeping into the very fabric of human institutions. They craft religions, wage wars, and build empires to serve their base needs. But time is a patient teacher, and as they grow in spirit, they leave behind these trappings.
When tyrannical regimes threaten to obscure the path, immortals themselves don human form, incarnating to restore truth. For all human experiences, from the grand to the seemingly mundane, are opportunities for learning, for growth.
Spiritual beings of our kind are, at their core, beneficent, loving, and ever-helpful. They serve as personal caregivers to soul beings across the vast expanse of our galaxy. And when we, too, attain immortality, we are freed from the cycle of samsara, the endless wheel of reincarnation that binds all soul beings to mortal, organic forms.
In the human form, the soul is the lower-self, the spirit the higher-self. We are the only hybrid soul/spirit beings, which makes us fragile and in need of constant protection by spiritual beings.
When spirit sanctifies soul, like the caterpillar is dismantled and rebuilt, they become one; we are reborn, remade as immortal spiritual beings.
The Law of Karma, an intricate metaphysical law, guides our curriculum on the Butterfly Path, sensing the experiences we need to grow, to learn, to correct our course.
For Wayists, spirituality is not confined to the halls of organized religion, buildings, and holy books by some god, but is woven into the very fabric of everyday life. We find meaning and purpose in all things, constantly striving to improve our self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-control, and self-craft. This is the path of evolving the soul into an immortal spiritual being.
Wayism needs no advertisement, no recruitment, for all humans walk the Path by virtue of their birth. When the student is ready, when Karma and your Divine Guide decides, the teacher appears. The student then encounters the deeper mysteries of Wayist teaching and falls in love with its profound truths. It's the mystical Way, and that is how it happened for all who graduated from this school of divinity for souls.
This Path assures ongoing growth and development, guiding us to become masters of soul and spirit energy, nurturing our connection to the divine, for we are on a Path to become divine. We learn to relate to all life-forms with equity, recognizing our place in the greater ecosystem of existence.
As we progress, we develop exceptional spiritual powers rooted not in dominance or destruction, but in humility, simplicity, and compassion. We are becoming helpers for soul-beings in our galaxy, in the future working with entities of all kinds.
The Butterfly Path is a shared journey, where students of all levels learn from and with each other. We are not equal, people are not equal, but we are all essential, each with our own unique curriculum and learning needs.
Karma is our guide, not a system of reward and punishment, but a provider of personalized growth opportunities, exactly what each soul needs at the time.
Through lifetimes of experience, of joys and sorrows, of the mundane and the profound, we learn, we grow, we become. theWAY flows through all human souls, regardless of their conscious adoption of Wayism. It is the very essence and purpose of the human experience. Wayism is the equitable Path on which all human beings who ever lived have been.
And when the time comes, when we awaken to our spiritual potential, when our spirit yearns for a deeper connection to the Immortals, Wayism becomes our guiding light. We find kinship with fellow sojourners, walking together towards our ultimate Home. For as the great teachers have said, in the end, we all become one with the flow of theWAY.
In the masterful intricacies of theWAY, everything is energy, and all is interconnected. From the smallest building block of energy to the vastness of galaxies, each energy structure possesses its own sense of identity and purpose. We, as energy beings, learn to master the flow of energies, shaping our reality through the power of Attitude.
As creators, all living beings use the energies from Source to craft thoughts, ideas, shelters, devise plans, and communities. Almost every living being builds shelters and raise young, networks with others in the ecosystem, hunt, farm food, and negotiate with other living beings for shared space and resources. In this sophisticated dance of existence, all beings --- from plants to animals, to the very soil beneath our feet --- all play their part in creation.
The human form, a marvel of complexity, houses three distinct energy structures: the soul, the organic, and the spirit. The soul, with its three minds of Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura, is the essence of the junior student, incarnated into the human body to learn the arts of caring for others not of their tribe, simplicity, and humbleness, qualities which are not familiar to its default nature.
The human brain, and the mind that it generates, while a powerful tool for survival and innovation, is not equipped for the work of the ethereal minds of soul and spirit.
It is in the fourth chakra, the Anahata mind, where the seed of spirit resides. This we receive in Paradise when first we set foot on Butterfly Path. As the conditions of Humility, Simplicity, and Loving-kindness grow, this seed of spirit awakens, gradually deploying the three immature spirit minds of the higher-self.
Through introspection, self-craft, and communion with Immortals, the higher-self gains spiritual wisdom, and the soul begins to evolve.
In time, the lower-self is sanctified and will merge with the higher-self, and we are born anew as immortal spiritual beings. This ultimate transformation, the graduation from the Butterfly Path, occurs not on Earth, but in the nurturing embrace of our spiritual family in heaven.
Wayist teaching and our personal Divine Protector and Guide, guides us through this journey, helping us navigate the challenges and opportunities of each grade. We learn to see beyond the illusions of brain-mind created reality, understanding the larger, more true reality by degrees as we mature.
The Immortals, our divine teachers and guides, are not bound by gender, but express themselves in the energies of yin and yang as needed. We look to them with awe and love, striving to assimilate their teachings and become more like them.
We incarnate into different genders, cultures, and circumstances, learning to break free from the shackles of cultural conditioned thinking and to own our own minds.
Karma, the great evaluator, is ever present and knows our thoughts, actions, inactions, and determines our developmentally appropriate learning needs. It is not a system of reward and punishment, but a guiding force that shapes our learning path, allocating the next birth according to our learning needs. Karma ensures that we master the skills necessary to become immortal spiritual beings, bringing us the experiences we need to grow and change.
Through constant endeavors for Humility, Simplicity, and Loving-kindness, we learn the metaphysical arts and skills. We learn the art of *chrestotes*, an ancient Greek word used by Lord Jesus. The wisdom lies in knowing the most appropriate helpful loving-kindness to provide at the right time, and then offering it to the best of your abilities. It is a massive concept, one of the finest and most sophisticated spiritual skills known to humans. And we must learn it, because our species of spirit beings, that which we are evolving into, is all about chrestotes.
This high skill, first explained by Lord Iesous, known in the Latin as Lord Jesus, takes many lifetimes to perfect.
For those who may not cognitively embrace Wayism, the path is still clear. Trust the process, for the human experience is a rare and precious gift. Embrace the challenges, learn from the sorrows, and indulge in the joys of sharing space with the vast ecosystem of Earth and the spiritual domain. Question every thought, reflect on every experience, and own your own mind.
theWAY and its Butterfly Path have been creating immortals for an unfathomable time, and you have been on this path for countless lifetimes. Your spiritual maturity is the fruit of ages of growth, with or without the conscious adoption of Wayism. But why do you now have this book in hand?
When the student is ready, the teacher appears, says the ancient Upanishad.
When your spirit yearns for a deeper connection, Wayism becomes your guiding light. You find kinship with fellow sojourners, walking together towards your ultimate Home.
In the end, as the great teachers have said, you become one with the flow of theWAY. You find your place in the grand energy ecosystem of existence, a unique thread woven into the eternal pattern. And in this journey, you are never alone, for theWAY is with you, guiding you, shaping you, until you emerge, radiant and eternal, an immortal spiritual being.
Upon the vast canvas of existence, theWAY paints a picture of hope and purpose. It reminds us that no matter how lost we may feel, no matter how many lifetimes we have wandered, we are always on the path, always learning, always growing.
There is no need for literacy, no need to understand the language in which a teaching is given, there is no secret doctrine, no initiation, no vow to pledge, no membership required. Even a just-born baby has its old soul and is making advances on the Path, simply from being here, as a human. Wayism, is the equitable Path -- it is the original Path -- and all humans are on it by default.
Wayism teaches us to embrace the fullness of human experience, to see the divine in the mundane, the profound in the simple. It invites us to dance with the energies of the universe, to find our rhythm in the divine cosmic symphony.
As we walk the Butterfly Path, we learn to shed the layers of illusion that separate us from our true nature. We learn to see beyond the veil of gender, ethnicity, nationality, and social status to recognize the divine spark that resides in human souls, and the cosmic essence that soars through every being.
We learn to cultivate the garden of our own soul, to plant the seeds of Humility, Simplicity, and Loving-kindness, and to tend them with the water of experience and the light of wisdom. And as we grow, we become a sanctuary for others, a living testament to the transformative power of theWAY.
In the school of life, we are both student and teacher, forever learning, forever sharing. We learn from the ant and the mountain, from the laughter of children and the tears of the bereaved. We learn from the Immortals who guide us, and from the fellow students who walk beside us, and the juniors, the soul-people, who create dystopian worlds.
And as we learn, we are transformed. Our soul, once heavy with the weight of ignorance, becomes light and luminous. Our spirit, once a mere seed, blossoms into a radiant flower. We become a bridge between the mortal and the divine, a conduit for the energy of Heaven.
This is the promise of Wayism, the promise of Heaven. It is not a promise of ease or comfort, but of growth and transformation. It is the promise that no matter how dark the night, dawn will always come. It is the promise that no matter how many times we fall, we will always rise again.
For in the end, we are all on the same journey, all walking the same path. We may take different routes, we may face different challenges, but our destination is the same. We are all heading here, to know this wisdom you hold in hand. We are all walking Home, to the light of rebirth.
And as we walk, we are never alone. The Immortals walk with us, guiding our steps, illuminating our path. Our fellow students walk beside us, sharing our joys and sorrows, our triumphs and failures. And theWAY itself walks within us, the eternal rhythm that pulses in our veins, the infinite wisdom that whispers in our hearts.
So let us walk together. Let us walk with courage and compassion, with humility and hope. Let us walk in the knowledge that every step, every breath, every moment, is a gift, a precious opportunity to learn, to grow, to become. Let us gather wisdom in higher self, for when the organic brain gets sick or dies, all it has in mind comes to naught. What it thinks now is your identity, character and memories, all come to naught. But the soul continues in samsara, will do it all over again until we take the higher path and graduate.
Let us walk the Butterfly Path, the path of theWAY. Let us embrace the challenges and the changes, the laughter and the tears. Let us dance with the energies of the universe, and sing with the stars. And all of those spiritual skills will be imbedded in our spirit-minds. It becomes us, forms our new character, the new person we are becoming. It will be what we take to the next life, or to heaven, and beyond.
And let us trust in the journey, in the wisdom of Karma, in the love of the Immortals. Let us trust that no matter how long the road, no matter how dark the night, we will find our way Home.
For this is the promise of heaven, the promise that echoes through the ages, from the first human soul that walked the earth to the last soul that will ascend to the Heavens. It is the promise of transformation, of evolution, of eternal becoming.
It is the promise of Wayism, the promise of theWAY of Heaven.
When you desire to advance in degree, to be a "cognitive Wayist" as they say. Someone who cognitively walks the Path of the final stretch of transformation, someone who wants to be, a Person of theWAY, as they say, and desires to associate with like-minded sojourners and want to help, we would love to sojourn with you. I leave you with a Rumi quote, one of the more prominent of teachers of theWAY:
"Your hand opens and closes, opens and closes. If it were always a fist or always stretched open, you would be paralyzed. Your deepest presence is in every small contracting and expanding, the two as beautifully balanced and coordinated as birds' wings."

## The Uniqueness of the Ancient Teaching
In the heart of Wayist wisdom, there lies a hidden foundation, a sanctuary of wisdom upon which all is built, an ethereal library that unveils its treasures only to those who have cultivated the readiness to receive the whispers in their higher selves. Within this sacred space, the luminous threads woven into the foundations of Wayism sparkle like gold and diamond stars and moons in the soul's dark night sky, each one a unique and precious gift to the seekers of truth, each beckoning to look closer.
These teachings, carefully guarded and passed down through the ages by the lineages of Wayist masters, are not mere echoes of familiar wisdom; they are the very essence of the Path. This book presents twenty-two philosophical and spiritual principles, not to teach it but to alert the seeker these are unique. They have no parallel in other traditions.
Like the delicate petals of a lotus flower, impossible to be soiled, rejecting any water droplets or outside interference, they have stood the test of time. Each insight unfolds to reveal the beauty and depth of the human spirit, and of the divine system within which we exist on Butterfly Path, inviting us to embrace our interconnectedness and the universality of our experiences.
Though some names and concepts may ring familiar to those who have explored the ancient traditions, the people of theWAY hold the key to their true and authentic meanings. They recognize that the pure spring of spiritual wisdom has, at times, been muddied by the motives and interpretations of those who sought to bend the teachings to their own will. Yet, the truth remains untarnished, waiting patiently for the sincere seeker to discover its radiance.
When the moment arrives, and the forces that guide our journey bring forth the spiritual truth we are meant to receive, our entire being resonates with a profound sense of recognition. The words on the page become more than mere ink; they become a mirror, reflecting the wisdom that has always resided within the depths of our souls. In that instant, we may feel a flicker of remembrance, a distant echo from lifetimes past, now obscured from our conscious mind but forever etched upon the canvas of our spiritual essence.
It is in this sacred space, where the treasures of Wayism shine brightest, that we are invited to embark on a journey of self-discovery and transformation. With each step, we unravel the mysteries of our existence, weaving together the threads of our shared humanity and the boundless love that connects us all. In the embrace of these teachings, we find not only the path to our own enlightenment, but also the key to unlocking the potential for compassion, unity, and harmony in the world around us.
## The Metaphysics and Art of the Tapestry
In the realm of spiritual traditions and metaphysical concepts, the word "tapestry" holds a profound significance that transcends the boundaries of time and culture. It is a term that speaks to the very essence of how wisdom is woven together, creating a rich and intricate pattern that tells the story of our shared human experience.
In today's fast-paced world, where snippets of information are hastily assembled like building blocks, the art of weaving has begun to fade from our collective consciousness. The modern mind, accustomed to the instant gratification of cut-and-paste creation, often overlooks the beauty and depth that can only be achieved through the patient and deliberate intertwining of threads that show themselves sometimes, hidden sometimes, but are always there as a foundation for other truths to exist.
The concept of the warp and weft, which lays the foundation for weaving of tapestries, is important in Wayist spirituality. The shimmering threads of wisdom used to weave the simple and most ancient tapestry of our tradition are there for us to marvel at the masterful artwork and its divine character.
But, for other traditions, they came along and decided to weave into the simple, humble, and compassionate tapestry of Wayism, their own threads. They wanted to "improve" it, or change the design to fit their needs. Cultural non-negotiables, or politics often motivated these needs. They made their own plush and luxurious tapestries, even thick carpets.
In the process, the original wisdom of theWAY was buried so deeply hidden, it takes a master to dig in and reveal it.
However, the backbone of the spiritual tapestry, providing structure and stability to the intricate designs that are woven upon them, was laid millennia ago.
That is why the Wayist sees in every religion and spirituality the ancient roots, and we recognize how others have modified the original. It is very obvious to us to recognize how Christianity moved away from theWAY to embellish its own Roman-Judaic version of the original tapestry. And it is easy for us to see how ancient mystics in other religious enclaves of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism speak the Wayist teachings in their poems.
As religions and belief systems have evolved over time, they have often obscured the simplicity and purity of this foundation. Like plush carpets woven upon the original tapestry, they added their dogmas and doctrines have buried the original intent of the wisdom strings and threads beneath layers of embellishment and interpretation. The once-clear connections between the various strands of wisdom had become hidden, lost in the dense knots and patterns that each culture and tradition has added to the tapestry.
In this age of spiritual seeking, it is essential that we rediscover the true nature of the tapestry that underlies all wisdom traditions. By stripping away the layers of cultural and historical embellishment, we can once again reveal the simple yet profound truth that binds us all together. Like the weavers of old, we must learn to appreciate the beauty and intricacy of the tapestry, while never losing sight of the fundamental threads that form its foundation.
Like the true tapestry, the message of the front and back is always the same, only the front has more highlights and looks more appealing to the outsider. The frame upon which it is woven is always discernable. When soul-religions make carpets, they make them plush; they knot tufts of wool to the back of an ancient tapestry and fluff it in front. In the end, changing the message to suit their needs and ruining the back, which now is covered in knots.
It is in this understanding of the interconnectedness of all essential basic strands of teaching and things that we find the key to unlocking the deeper meaning of our spiritual journey. By recognizing that all religious and spiritual traditions and beliefs are ultimately woven upon the same warp, weft, and original tapestry, we can begin to see beyond the superficial differences that divide us and embrace the universal truths that unite us.
In the end, the significance of the tapestry and plush carpets lie not in the individual knots and patterns that each culture has added, but in the recognition that beneath the surface, we are all part of a single, continuous thread, woven together by the hands of the divine.
There is only one Path, and we are all on it. There is only one Purpose of Life, and we are all living it. There is only one spiritual destination for all, and we are all heading toward it. There is but one Heaven, and one father God in heaven and Mother God in Heaven, and they care for us all while on this Butterfly Path, the school of divinity for soul beings.
It is in this realization that we find the true essence of spiritual wisdom, and the path to a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. It is in this realization that we find Wayism closest to the simple, humble, compassionate, and holy tapestry, so ancient it flabbergasts the mind, to be the very foundation upon which human spirituality is woven.
## The Metaphysical Law of Karma
### Karma is not "reward and punishment". It manages our curriculum in Butterfly Path, the school of divinity for souls.
In the grand tapestry of spiritual evolution, the metaphysical Law of Karma emerges as the great orchestrator, weaving the intricate threads of an individual's journey on the Butterfly Path. This cosmic principle, the metaphysical Law, often misunderstood as a mere system of reward and punishment, is, in truth, a profound and personalized curriculum, tailored to guide each soul towards the experiences necessary for their growth and transformation.
In the realm of soul religions, the concept of Karma has often been distorted, reduced to a transactional belief in "good karma" and "karmic merits," as if the path to the divine could be bought and sold like a commodity, or negotiated. But the Wayist understanding recognizes that the true path of sanctification and holiness is not a matter of spiritual commerce, but rather a sacred unfolding, a journey of the soul that cannot be purchased or bargained for.
Like a great cosmic AI which learns from all that soul-minds and spirit-minds think and do, Karma watches our thoughts, needs, wants, desires, and how we deal with them, and it monitors our actions and inactions. It uses that data to determine what lessons and experiences we need in the future to help us learn all the skills necessary to one day graduate from the school of divinity.
The Law of Karma, in its purest form, is not a cosmic ledger of debts and credits, but rather a loving guide, a wise teacher that directs us towards the precise lessons and experiences we need to progress on the Butterfly Path, that great School of Divinity. It is the hand that gently steers us towards the challenges that will forge our character, the joys that will expand our hearts, and the revelations that will illuminate our minds.
Yet Karma is not a lenient master, for the path of spiritual evolution demands dedication and sincerity. Those who consistently fail to learn from the lessons presented, who refuse to heed the call of their higher nature, may find themselves cast back into the endless cycle of reincarnations from which they emerged. In this way, Karma serves not only as a guide but also as a guardian, ensuring that only those truly committed to their own growth and the upliftment of all beings may continue on the sacred journey.
For the Wayist, then, the Law of Karma is not a source of fear or anxiety, but rather a profound recognition of the infinite wisdom and compassion that undergirds the Path. It is a reminder that every experience, every encounter, every moment of our lives is imbued with purpose and meaning, and that by aligning ourselves with the flow of Karma, we are aligning ourselves with the very heart of the divine.
As we walk the Butterfly Path, let us embrace the guidance of Karma with open hearts and minds, knowing that every step, every challenge, every triumph, is a sacred opportunity for growth and transformation. It is a way to learn the lessons that we have failed in the past, so we advance. Let us release the illusions of spiritual transactions and merits, and instead, trust in the profound intelligence of the cosmos, the loving hand that guides us ever closer to the realization of our highest potential.
For in the end, the Law of Karma is not a burden to be borne, but a gift to be cherished, a sacred key that unlocks the doors of our own divinity. May we walk this path with courage, with faith, and with the unwavering commitment to our own soul's evolution, knowing that every twist and turn of the journey is a precious thread in the grand tapestry of our spiritual awakening.
### Karma
> Karma, the great manager of our soul's journey,\
> Weaves for each a personalized tapestry.\
> Not reward nor punishment its aim,\
> But to illumine the path to the Divine.\
> Through life's joys and pain,\
> Karma guides us, without blame,\
> To the lessons our spirit most need,\
> So we ascend, by degree to the Divine
## The Metaphysical Law of Dharma
#### Dharma is each person's inherent moral code and wisdom base
In Wayist wisdom, Dharma emerges as the spiritual thread, weaving together the essence of our being with the eternal laws of the universe. It is not a rigid set of rules imposed from without, but a deeply personal and evolving code of ethics, a sacred compass that guides us through the labyrinth of life's choices and challenges.
With each layer of wisdom we achieve, we inherit a duty to act accordingly. Wisdom is not wisdom if you don't live it.
Therefore, with each layer of wisdom, we inherit the duty of acting accordingly, and that is our Dharma, our inviolable inherent, baked-in moral code of conduct.
Each soul, as it journeys through the cycles of birth and rebirth, carves its own unique path, shaping its Dharma with every experience, every lesson learned, every wisdom gained. Like a master artisan, we chisel away at the rough stone of our being, revealing the gleaming statue of our spiritual potential, a work of art that reflects the divine spark within.
With every wisdom we master, every insight we glean, we inherit a sacred duty --- to honor that wisdom, to let it permeate our thoughts, our judgments, our actions and inactions. This is the essence of our Dharma, the inviolable moral code that becomes the very fabric of our soul.
As we walk the path of self-discovery, our Dharma becomes more than just a set of principles; it becomes our identity, the ineffable essence that defines us. We are, in a profound sense, the sum total of our Dharma, the embodiment of the wisdom, compassion, and integrity, we have cultivated over lifetimes.
And herein lies the great mystery and beauty of Dharma: it shapes not only our actions but our very nature. One soul, guided by a Dharma that allows for violence and exploitation, may transgress against the weak and the innocent without compunctione,on. Another, whose Dharma has been forged in the fires of empathy and reverence for life, will find such acts unthinkable, as impossible as defying the laws of gravity. For one it is her nature, for the other, it is sin.
For when our Dharma can be said to be good, when it is steeped in the nectars of love, compassion, and justice, we become essentially good. Not through the force of external constraints, but because our very being resonates with the frequency of the divine, the eternal song of the universe.
This is the secret of the immortal spiritual beings, the deities, and angels that grace the heavens. Their Dharma, honed over eons of self-discovery and self-mastery, has become a wellspring of pure beneficence. They cannot cause harm. Not because they are shackled by rules, but because their essence is a perfect reflection of the divine love that permeates all of spiritual creation.
And so, we see that the soul gods, the gods of the soul people, the gods who can inflict suffering and sorrow, who bring calamity on people, are not spiritual deities, but rather soul wayfarers on the path, their Dharma still a work in progress, a diamond in the rough awaiting the transformative touch of wisdom and grace.
And as we grow in wisdom and compassion, as our Dharma blossoms into a fragrant flower of pure goodness, we discover that righteousness is not a burden, but a joy. We do not refrain from harm because we are constrained, but because harming another would be like wounding our own soul and defile our spirit. We are good, not by force of will, but by the radiant nature of our being.
When we choose to live a lifestyle that goes against the grain of our dharma, a profound sense of unwellness begins to take hold, affecting all aspects of our being --- body, mind, soul, and spirit. This condition is known as Dharmic Dissonance.
At first, Dharmic Dissonance manifests as a subtle feeling of discomfort and unease. However, as we continue to ignore our inner wisdom and ethics, the chronic negative energy of this misalignment begins to take its toll. The very essence of who we are becomes compromised, and our entire being starts to suffer.
This dissonance can manifest as a wide range of diseases and illnesses that afflict the physical body, as well as the soul-mind and spirit-mind. If left unaddressed, Dharmic Dissonance has the potential to erode lifetimes of progress on the spiritual Path, ravaging the body and eroding the soul-mind and spirit-mind.
The experience of Dharmic Dissonance can be likened to food poisoning. By continually feeding our entire energy being a toxic diet of thoughts, actions, and choices that go against our true nature, we become depleted and may even risk losing all the spiritual wisdom gains we had made over lifetimes, and heap mountains of karma for this and next lives.
It is important to note that when we are in a state of Dharmic Dissonance, happiness becomes elusive, and depression becomes our constant companion.
For us, the seekers on the Wayist path, the cultivation of our Dharma is the great work of our lives. Through self-knowledge, self-control, and self-craft, we shape our essence, moment by moment, lifetime by lifetime. We learn to align our actions with our deepest truths, to let our Dharma be the north star that guides us through the storms of desire and delusion.
This is the ultimate promise of the Wayist path, the sacred destination that beckons to us across the ages. To become, in essence, a pure reflection of the divine beings in Heaven, a being whose every thought, every word, every deed, is a song of love, a hymn of compassion, a dance of sacred unity.
May we walk this path with courage and devotion, trusting in the wisdom of our unfolding Dharma, and in the infinite love that guides us, now and always.
### Dharma
Dharma, the ineffable wisdom within,\
The essence of who we truly are.\
\
Across lifetimes it grows, a wellspring\
Of duty, morality, knowing what's right.\
\
With each truth grasped, a sacred charge\
To embody that wisdom, to let it take flight\
In thought, in choice, in how we walk,\
Shaping the core of our immortal light.
One may transgress, if their dharma allows,\
While to another, the very thought appalls.
For when dharma has flowered in goodness complete,\
Harmfulness simply falls away, obsolete.
The deities, resplendent, cannot be but kind,\
For beneficence forms the whole of their mind.
We too shall grow, through lifetimes untold,\
Till goodness is not a constraint, but our essence pure unfold.
## The Metaphysical Law of Maya
#### By Grace, veils of illusion shelter us from Reality for which we are not yet prepared
In the beauty and wonders of metaphysical laws, for the Wayist, the Law of Maya stands as a divine grace, a concept that makes our lives possible and comfortable. It is a principle that acknowledges the profound wisdom and compassion of the universe, which veils us from the full intensity of Reality, not to deceive, but to protect.
Maya, in her infinite grace, holds the filters of illusion between our fragile human consciousness and the blazing sun of ultimate Truth. Like a loving mother shielding her child's eyes from the blinding glare, she reveals Reality to us gradually, removing the veils one by one as we grow in wisdom and strength, ready to bear the weight of deeper understanding.
For without the protective embrace of Maya, we would be like tender shoots thrust into the scorching desert, withering under the relentless light of a truth too vast for our fledgling souls to comprehend. She is the wise guardian, ensuring that we drink from the fountain of knowledge at a pace that nourishes, a pace we are ready to do, rather than overwhelms, that inspires rather than shatters.
In her boundless compassion, Maya shields our soul minds from the memories of our past lives, the countless experiences etched into the fabric of our eternal being. She understands that to bear the full burden of our history would be to drown in a sea of unresolved emotions, unfulfilled promises, and unhealed wounds. How could we navigate the challenges of this life if we were haunted by the specters of loves lost, betrayals endured, atrocities committed, and debts unpaid across the ages?
And so, with each new birth, Maya grants us the gift of forgetting, a merciful veil that allows us to begin anew, unencumbered by the weight of our past. Like a compassionate teacher, she knows that true learning comes not from memorizing facts, but from distilling wisdom from experience. It is the essence of our growth, the pearls of insight born from the grit of our struggles, that we carry with us from one life to the next.
For when the physical body dies and the brain's storehouse of memories fades like a dream upon waking, it is the eternal wisdom imprinted upon our soul and spirit-minds that endures. These are the veritable treasures we accumulate on our journey through the cycles of birth and death, the building blocks of our evolving character and the essence of our being.
It is through the development of wisdom, the patient nurturing of our dharma, that we become more than the sum of our experiences. We are shaped, not by the fleeting details of our past lives, but by the overarching lessons we have learned, the wisdoms that settled in our metaphysical minds, the love that has expanded our hearts, and the compassion that has deepened our connection to all living beings.
And so, we see that the Law of Maya is not a cruel deception, but a profound expression of the universe's love and wisdom. She spares us from the overwhelming flood of memories that would render our present life unlivable, granting us the space to focus on the here and now, to fully embrace the challenges and opportunities of our current incarnation.
Imagine, for a moment, the chaos that would ensue if we carried the full weight of our past lives into the present. How could we forge new relationships, build new dreams, and embrace new possibilities if we were shackled by the chains of ancient grudges, unresolved debts, and forgotten commitments? We would be like ships forever anchored to the harbor of the past, unable to set sail on the vast ocean of our potential.
And so, we thank Maya for her gentle touch, for the wisdom that guides her hand as she shields us from the blinding light of total recall. We trust in her guidance, knowing that she will lift the veils as we are ready, revealing the deeper truths of our existence with a timing that is always perfect, always in service to our highest good.
As we walk the path of wisdom, let us do so with gratitude for Maya's protective embrace, secure in the knowledge that our true essence, our eternal dharma, is forever safe in the sanctuary of our soul and spirit minds. And let us strive, with each thought, each word, each deed, to weave a tapestry of love and compassion that will adorn the halls of eternity, a testament to the transformative power of the Wayist path.
### Maya
> Divine Sister Maya, the great protectress, holds her veils\
> Between our fragile selves and Truth's blazing light.\
> Not to deceive, but to shield us with her art,\
> Removing each gossamer layer as we grow in might.
> For Reality's unfiltered radiance would consume\
> The unready soul, leaving only ash and blight.\
> Maya's mercy hides past lives from present view,\
> Lest memories overwhelm, a tangled skein of plight.
> When body's mind expires, its knowledge scatters,\
> But wisdom's etchings on the soul remain.\
> The loves that shaped us, the trials that taught,\
> These form our dharma, our essence they sustain.
> Yet to cling to each detail of lives gone by\
> Would mire us in a fruitless, endless pain.\
> Maya grants us fresh beginnings, free to seek\
> The lessons we most need, unbound by memory's chain.
## Paradise:
### Temporary Heaven Between Incarnations
 In the celestial domains of Wayist cosmology, Paradise, known in Sanskrit as Purusthana, shines like a beacon of hope and renewal, a sanctuary where weary souls find respite between the cycles of birth and death. It is a realm of gentle light and soothing energies; a temporary haven designed to nurture and prepare the fledgling spirits embarking on the transformative journey of the Butterfly Path.
For those souls newly arriving in Paradise, to embark on Butterfly Path the first time, the gift of the Anahata soul-mind awaits, a precious seed of divinity that holds within it the potential for spiritual awakening and growth. This sacred essence, planted deep within the core of our being, is the key that unlocks the door to our highest nature, the spark that ignites the flame of our eternal spirit.
In the tranquil gardens of Paradise, we are granted a precious opportunity to pause and reflect, to assimilate the lessons of our previous incarnation and to prepare for the next chapter in our soul's journey. It is a time of deep introspection, where we can shed the layers of illusion and attachment that may have clouded our perception, and reconnect with the fundamental truths of our existence.
Under the loving guidance of advanced spiritual teachers, we immerse ourselves in the study of divine wisdom, exploring the intricacies of the cosmic laws that govern our universe. We learn to cultivate the seeds of compassion, to nurture the blossoms of wisdom, and to trust in the perfect unfolding of our spiritual path as we prepare to depart, either for rebirth in Heaven or another incarnation on Earth.
And through it all, our Divine Tara remains by our side, a constant companion and guide, a beacon of love and support that illuminates our way. From the moment our soul leaves its earthly vessel, Tara is there to escort us to the gentle shores of Paradise, her presence a soothing balm that eases the transition from one realm to another.
In the chrysalis of Paradise, we rest and regenerate, gathering strength for the next cycle of growth and transformation. We commune with other souls on the path, sharing stories of struggle and triumph, of love and loss, weaving together the collective tapestry of our spiritual journey.
And when the time comes to return to the earthly realm, to embark on a new incarnation chosen by the wise hand of Karma, Tara is there once again, guiding us back to the world of form and matter. With infinite tenderness, she watches over us as we navigate the challenges and opportunities of our new life; her love is a constant reminder of our true nature and our ultimate destination.
For those who walk the Wayist path, the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is a familiar dance, a sacred rhythm that echoes through the ages. Each passage through the gates of Paradise is an opportunity to deepen our connection to the divine, to polish the mirror of our soul until it reflects the luminous truth of our being.
And so, we learn to embrace the journey with open hearts and curious minds, knowing that every step, every stumble, every triumph, is a precious thread in the grand tapestry of our spiritual evolution. We find comfort in the knowledge that Paradise awaits us at the end of each earthly sojourn, a place of healing and renewal where we can gather the nectar of wisdom and prepare for the next stage of our cosmic adventure.
In the glow of Paradise's gentle light, we come to understand that our true home is not a place, but a state of being to which we evolve, a radiant space of love and unity that becomes us, dwells within us always. And with each passing cycle, each rotation of the great wheel of life, we move ever closer to that ultimate reality, guided by the unwavering love of our Divine Tara and the eternal wisdom of the Wayist path.
May we cherish the gift of Paradise, the sacred sanctuary that nurtures our soul's growth and prepares us for the journey ahead. And may we trust in the perfect unfolding of our spiritual path, knowing that every step, every breath, every moment, is a precious opportunity to awaken to the divine truth that resides within us all.
### Paradise
Paradise, sweet Purusthana, haven of respite\
For fledgling souls embarking on the Path Divine.
There the seed of spirit, Anahata, is bestowed,\
The spark of divinity within us must shine.
Between each earthly sojourn, Paradise calls us home,\
To reflect, to learn, to prepare for the next design
That Karma has ordained, the precise crucible\
To 'forge' our souls, till at last we are refine'd.
## Heaven:
### the Pure Land of Bliss
#### The spiritual heaven of our type of spiritual being
In the celestial realm of Sukhavati, as Pure Land of Bliss is spelled by ancient lips, the eternal abode of God the Father and God the Mother, is where all the buddhas and deities and saints live.
The Wayist vision of Heaven unfolds like a blossoming lotus, each petal a story of purpose, meaning, and boundless love. It is home to our Divine Lotus Family. It is a realm where the soul's highest aspirations find their ultimate expression, where the divine spark within each being is nurtured and celebrated in symphonies of spiritual growth and service.
For the Wayist, Heaven is not a static paradise of idle pleasures, but a dynamic tapestry of purposeful existence, woven from the threads of *chrestotes*---the sacred art of being helpful and kind in the wisest and most profound ways. It is a realm where the spirit's unique gifts and talents are honed and applied in the service of all beings, a place where the boundaries between self and other dissolve in the radiant light of universal compassion.
In this garden school we call Earth, the seed of spirit bestowed upon us by God the Father, finds the perfect conditions to flourish and grow. Under the loving guidance of God the Mother and her yin-energy workers, our fledgling spirits are nourished and protected, bathed in the gentle light of divine wisdom and unconditional love. Like celestial gardeners, they tend to the delicate petals of our unfolding awareness, ensuring that we blossom into the fullness of our spiritual potential.
As we journey through the sacred landscape of our spiritual heaven, Sukhavati, we walk in the footsteps of the great spiritual luminaries who have gone before us. In the gentle presence of Lord Siddartha Gautama, we find inspiration and guidance --- his life a shining example of the transformative power of wisdom and compassion. In the radiant love of Lord Krishna, we discover the joy of devotion and the eternal dance of the soul with the Divine. And in the boundless compassion of Lord Avalokitesvara, known in Chinese as Guanyin, we encounter the very essence of the Bodhisattva ideal---the unwavering commitment to the liberation of all beings.
These enlightened beings, our elder brothers and sisters in the celestial family, serve as guiding lights on our own journey of spiritual awakening. They are the Lords of our galaxy, the embodiments of the Divine's highest aspirations for soul beings in human bodies. And as we walk the path of the Wayist, we, too, are becoming children of God, our souls blossoming into the full expression of our divine nature.
In the sacred space of Sukhavati, we learn to embody the essence of *chrestotes*, to become vessels of divine love and wisdom in service to all beings. We discover that true help, the most profound form of kindness, is not merely a matter of alleviating temporary suffering, but of awakening the soul to its own inherent divinity. Through our thoughts, our words, and our deeds, we become conduits of Heaven's grace, transmitting the light of spiritual truth to all who cross our path.
And as we grow in wisdom and compassion, we come to understand that the journey to Heaven is not a distant goal, but a sacred unfolding that begins in each moment, in each breath, in each choice we make. For the true essence of Sukhavati, the very heart of the Divine, resides within us always, waiting to be discovered and nurtured through the alchemy of spiritual practice and selfless service.
May we embrace the Wayist vision of Heaven, not as a far-off paradise, but as a living reality that we co-create inside as we increase in awareness with each act of love, each gesture of kindness, each moment of sacred remembrance.
May we trust in the loving guidance of God the Father and God the Mother, knowing that we are forever held in the infinite embrace of the Divine. And may we walk the path of *chrestotes* with courage and devotion, becoming ever more radiant reflections of the eternal light that shines within us all.
For in the sacred space of Heaven, in the eternal dance of yin and yang, in the gentle blooming of the celestial lotus, we discover our true home, our true purpose, and our true nature ----- as beloved children of the Divine, forever growing in wisdom, love, and service to all of creation.
### Our Heaven, our Pure Land of Bliss.
And Heaven, not mere respite, but a realm of purpose,\
Where kindness is our art, our truest occupation.\
Chrestotes, the work of aiding fellow souls\
With wisdom and compassion, our spirits' culmination.\
In the Land of Bliss, we serve with joy unmarred,\
Our dharma flowered to its purest manifestation.\
From Paradise to Heaven, Maya to Karma's way,\
We journey on, till all reach illumination.
## About Soul-beings
### Soul-minds and Soul-people
 In the intricate tapestry of existence, where the threads of life and consciousness intertwine, the Wayist understanding of souls emerges as a luminous strand, rich in wisdom and depth. It is a perspective that acknowledges the presence of a soul in every living being, from the simplest creature to the most complex, each endowed with the sacred spark of animating energy.
Souls, in the Wayist tradition, are seen as mortal entities, their lifespan spanning nearly a thousand years when measured against the fleeting cycles of Earth time. Yet within this shared mortality, there exists a vast spectrum of soul complexity and potential. Some souls are like delicate wisps of light, their essence pure and uncomplicated, while others, like those of human beings, are intricately woven, adorned with three powerful soul minds known as Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura.
These soul-minds, often mistaken for mere chakras (a Sanskrit word that means wheels), in other spiritual traditions, are recognized in Wayism as the very core of our hybrid psycho-spiritual being. They are the minds of the soul, the repositories of our deepest instincts, emotions, and desires, the hidden wellsprings from which our soul's thoughts, actions, and experiences flow. It is through the profound understanding and skillful navigation of these soul-minds that Wayists embark upon the path of healing, growth, and self-transformation. It is these soul-minds we will begin to sanctify when we awaken spiritually. We will "make over our soul minds", as Lord Jesus says we must, using the Greek word, metanoia. We will sanctify them.
The wisdom of working with soul-mind energies for healing and correction is not a new or borrowed concept in Wayism, but rather an ancient and integral part of its teachings. It is a science of the soul, a true psychology, a sacred art passed down through generations of spiritual adepts who have dedicated their lives to the exploration of consciousness and the cultivation of inner harmony. While other traditions may borrow fragments of this knowledge, it is in Wayism that one finds the most comprehensive and authentic understanding of the soul's nature and potential.
As souls awaken to their spiritual essence, they begin to receive nourishment from the divine, their very being slowly transformed by the influx of sacred energy. This process of spiritual awakening is not a momentary event, but a gradual unfoldment, a blossoming of the soul that can span countless lifetimes. For those souls who have truly embraced the path of spiritual growth, the cycle of reincarnation becomes a journey of ever-expanding consciousness, their lifespan extended to thousands of years because of spiritual influence as they navigate the challenges and opportunities of human existence.
The essence of a soul, in the Wayist understanding, is not bound by the limitations of physical form or earthly matter, it hails from Soul Energy Domain. It is a being of pure energy, emanating from a realm beyond the confines of the three-dimensional world. In its most condensed state, a soul may appear no larger than a pinhead, yet when fully activated by will, it can expand its aura and energetic presence to encompass a vast area, radiating its light and influence far beyond the boundaries of its physical vessel.
Wayism's unique distinction between soul people and spirit people is a testament to its profound understanding of the spectrum of consciousness. This ancient wisdom, echoed in the teachings of Lord Jesus and even acknowledged in the Christian scriptures, recognizes that individuals are at different stages of their spiritual evolution.
Soul people, those whose consciousness is primarily governed by their soul minds, often find themselves drawn to the realm of the material, their priorities shaped by the desires and impulses of their lower nature. They are prone to power-seeking, domination, competition, tribalism, identity crises, getting something for nothing, hoarding resources.
The problems of soul-minds, the soul people feel, must be their main concern and often it identifies them. They can 'become' their soul-mind problem. Minds are very powerful things. When there are soul-mind problems, they call it correctly as, psychological problems. The word psyche means soul, in Greek. Today we also refer to it, correctly so, as mental wellness issues. It is what is happening in the soul's minds. Not illness, just the stuff that go on in the soul's minds. People don't anymore learn higher-self skills to manage it, therefore it generates wealth for the chemical and counseling industries, and for consumerism, and for warmongers who fire up advocates for their causes.
They may seek solace in religious or irreligious pursuits, venerating soul deities (who are like them, just more powerful), and connecting to soul deities, which reflect their own level of understanding and aspirations. These are the soul-people, the majority of people on the campus of School of Divinity for Souls. They are also the majority of voters in democratic systems.
In contrast, spirit-people are those whose consciousness has begun to awaken to the higher dimensions of their being. Their spirit minds rule over their soul minds, keeping them at bay, changing them, sanctifying them. Guided by the wisdom of their spirit minds, they are drawn to the path of spiritual growth and self-realization, their values and ethics increasingly aligned with the principles of unity, compassion, and service. As their awareness expands, they find themselves able to connect with spiritual deities, and access realms of insight and understanding beyond the reach of the ordinary mind. These are the spirit-people, the minority of people on the campus.
The Wayist path, then, is an invitation to embark upon a journey of soul-awakening, to gradually shift our center of gravity from the realm of the soul to the realm of the spirit. It is a path of self-discovery and self-mastery, a sacred dance in which we learn to harmonize the various aspects of our being and align ourselves with the greater unfolding of the cosmos.
By embracing the wisdom of Wayism, we open ourselves to the possibility of profound transformation, not only for ourselves, but for all those whose lives we touch. As we navigate the challenges and opportunities of existence, guided by the light of our soul minds and the wisdom of our spirit, we become increasingly attuned to the sacred essence that underlies all of creation.
In this journey of awakening, we come to understand that the true measure of our growth is not found in the accumulation of earthly knowledge or power, but in the depth of our compassion, the purity of our love, and the breadth of our service to all beings. We learn to see beyond the illusions of separation and difference, recognizing the divine spark that animates every soul, no matter its level of complexity or evolution.
As we walk the Wayist path, let us remain ever mindful of the sacred responsibility we bear as custodians of this ancient wisdom. May we approach the study and practice of soul-mind navigation with humility, reverence, and an unwavering commitment to the highest good of all. And may we always remember that the ultimate goal of our journey is not merely personal enlightenment, but wholesomeness and equity for all beings, in honor of their essential nature.
For in the final analysis, the Wayist understanding of souls is not just a philosophical or metaphysical framework, but a clarion call to embrace the fullness of our humanity and the vastness of our spiritual potential. It is an invitation to dance in the grand ballet of existence, to contribute our unique light to the dignity of all beings and the mission of heaven, and to journey together towards the ultimate realization of our divine essence.
May we heed this call with courage, compassion, and an open heart, knowing that in every step, every breath, every act of love and service, we are weaving the threads of our soul's destiny and participating in the great unfolding of the Plan of theWAY. And may we find, in the timeless wisdom of Wayism, a guiding light that illuminates our path and reveals the sacred truth of our innermost being.

## About Spirit-beings
### Spirit-minds and Spirit-people
 In the divine melody of Wayist cosmology, spirit-beings shine like eternal stars, their luminous presence a testament to the inextinguishable nature of the divine spark within. Unbounded by the fleeting cycles of birth and death, these immortal entities dwell in the spirit's realm, their essence woven from the very fabric of the infinite.
Within the microcosm of the human being, the spirit is adorned with three resplendent minds: Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara. These celestial facets of consciousness serve as the gateway to the higher dimensions of reality, the portals through which the soul may glimpse the ineffable beauty and wisdom of the divine. It is through the cultivation and activation of these spirit-minds that the human being progressively awakens to their true nature, to the limitless potential that lies dormant within.
Bridging the realms of soul and spirit, the Anahata mind serves as a sacred portal, a hybrid conduit through which the two aspects of being may commune and harmonize. It is the meeting place of heaven and earth, the point of intersection where the temporal and the eternal dance in a sublime embrace. As the soul begins to attune itself to the loving-kindness vibrations of the spirit, the Anahata mind blossoms like a celestial flower, its petals unfolding to reveal the hidden treasures of the inner world. And it starts to acquaint the soul-minds with the existence of higher-self energies.
When the soul has awakened to spiritual potential, the spirit in us develops its spirit-minds. In time, the flow of heavenly energies from on high, through Anahata to the soul minds, changes the soul, sanctifies its minds. The soul evolves and will become like spirit. At that time, we will be reborn into the realm of the spirit, we enter the inner celestial abode as a newborn, pure and radiant.
In this divine nursery, the spirit-being is endowed with three primary spirit-minds, plus the sanctified minds of what used to be soul-minds, and these are the foundation upon which its eternal existence will unfold.
These minds, sanctified and refined by the trials and triumphs of earthly life, serve as the building blocks of the spirit's ever-expanding spiritual awareness and skills---which are beyond human consciousness.
Yet the potential for growth and evolution in the spirit realm knows no bounds. As the spirit-being progresses on its celestial journey, it may acquire additional spirit minds, each one a facet of the divine gemstone, reflecting the infinite hues of wisdom and love; their being, a kaleidoscope of ever-unfolding beauty and grace.
The bodies of spirit beings, unlike the dense physical forms of earthly creatures, are woven from the gossamer threads of pure spirit energy, their substance drawn from the ineffable essence of the Spirit Energy Domain. In this realm, the limitations of material existence dissolve, and the spirit is free to express itself in ways that transcend the confines of time and space.
It is important to note that spirit-beings, as energy entities, do not possess the physical attributes that characterize earthly life. They do not have eyes to see, tongues to taste, mouths to speak, or ears to hear in the conventional sense. Rather, their perception and communication occur on a level that surpasses the sensory world, a realm of pure spirit consciousness, and direct energetic exchange.
When a spirit-being connects with a human, it is not through the crude medium of sound waves or physical gestures, but through the subtle language of the mind and the heart. In these sacred encounters, the spirit touches the deepest recesses of the human psyche, imparting wisdom, guidance, and healing through the wordless transmission of energy and love.
The human brain, in its attempt to make sense of these transcendent experiences, may create mental images or sensations that feel familiar and relatable. When encountering a disembodied soul or a spiritual deity, the mind may project a form or a face that resonates with its own cultural and personal associations. These mental constructs, while not an accurate representation of the spirit's true essence, serve as a bridge between the physical and the metaphysical, allowing the human to engage with the spirit realm in a way that feels accessible and meaningful.
As we navigate the path of spiritual awakening, it is crucial to remember that these mental images are but a veil, a temporary construct that allows us to interface with the ineffable. The true nature of the spirit lies beyond form and appearance, beyond the limitations of human perception and understanding. It is a realm of pure consciousness, of boundless love and wisdom, where the distinctions between self and other, between form and formlessness, dissolve in the light of divine unity.
The Wayist path invites us to cultivate a deep reverence for the spirit realm, to approach these sacred encounters with humility, openness, and a willingness to surrender our preconceptions and attachments. As we attune ourselves to the vibrations of the divine spirit, as we allow ourselves to be guided by the wisdom of our own inner knowing, we begin to peel back the layers of illusion that obscure our true nature.
In this process of awakening, we come to understand that we are not separate from the spirit realm, but an integral part of it. The spirit minds that dwell within us are not foreign entities, but aspects of our own divine essence, waiting to be discovered and activated. As we learn to listen to their subtle whispers, to follow their guidance and inspiration, we begin to align ourselves with the greater unfolding of the cosmos, to dance in harmony with the eternal song of creation.
May we approach the realm of spirit with reverence and wonder, knowing that each encounter, each moment of connection, is a sacred gift, a window into the infinite. May we trust in the wisdom of our own inner being, allowing the spirit minds to illumine our path and guide us towards the realization of our highest potential. And may we remember, always, that the true essence of spirit lies not in the forms it takes, but in the boundless love and wisdom that flows through all of existence, forever calling us home to the heart of the divine.

 In the mystical garden of existence, where the eternal dance of transformation and evolution unfolds, the Butterfly Path emerges as a sacred school, a celestial academy where human souls embark upon the ultimate journey of self-development, evolution, and metamorphosis.
It is a spiritual Path, and opportunity to rapidly evolve into an immortal spiritual being. A Path that beckons soul-beings all over the galaxy, but few qualify to enter.
Available by definition to all human beings, Butterfly Path rings forever a silent whisper in the depths of our crude being, urging us to seek divinity, to one day spread our wings and take flight into the realm of the divine.
The Butterfly Path is not a mere metaphor, but a profound reality that underlies the very fabric of our existence. It is the cosmic curriculum and school that guides our souls through the labyrinth of life, the alchemical process by which we transmute the lead of our lower nature into the gold of spiritual awakening.
Every thoughtful step we take, every mindful breath we breathe, every examined choice we make, is a lesson in this grand school of the soul, a sacred opportunity to grow, evolve, and ultimately transcend the limitations of our earthly existence.
From the far reaches of the galaxy, advanced souls are drawn to this cosmic academy, like moths to a flame. They come from distant stars and unknown worlds, each bearing the unique imprint of their own soul journey, yet all are united in their quest for evolution and spiritual enlightenment. These beings, of whom we are kin, far older and wiser than we can fathom, recognize the Earth as a sacred crucible, a planetary classroom, a campus, where the most profound lessons of love, compassion, and unity can be learned and embodied.
As junior students on the Butterfly Path, we humans often find ourselves trapped in the illusions of caterpillar mind. Dominated by the primal instincts of our lower nature, we engage in the endless pursuits of power-seeking, competition, acquisition, and self-aggrandizement. We seek to hoard resources, to camouflage our true selves behind masks of social acceptability, and to wield power over others in a misguided attempt to fill the void within. Like caterpillars, we crawl through life's underbrush, consumed by the narrow confines of our own limited perspective, unaware of the vast potential that lies dormant within us.
Yet, as we progress along the Path, as we allow ourselves to be molted by the trials and tribulations of existence, a profound transformation begins to take place. Slowly, imperceptibly at first, our consciousness begins to expand, our priorities begin to shift, and our hearts begin to open to the whispers of the divine. We start to sense that there is more to life than the endless cycle of material pursuits and ego gratification, that our true nature is far greater and more luminous than we ever dared to imagine. We tire of the ever-present cycles of dystopian cruelty the juniors create on the campus.
It is in this moment of awakening, this precious juncture on the Butterfly Path, that we begin to feel the stirrings of a new desire, a holy longing that sets our souls ablaze. We catch a glimpse of the beauty, the grace, and the freedom of the butterfly, and something within us is forever changed. We realize that we, too, are meant to soar, to dance in the sunlight of divine love, to sip the nectar of spiritual wisdom and share its sweetness with all of creation.
This realization marks the beginning of a profound inner transformation, a process that Lord Jesus in the language of the ancient Greeks called "metanoia" - the complete reformation of our minds and hearts. We begin to shed the layers of conditioning and limitation that have kept us bound to caterpillar existence, and we start to cultivate the qualities of the spirit - helpful loving-kindness, humility, simplicity, spiritual energy awareness, and interconnectedness. We engage in spiritual practices and disciplines that help us to purify our minds, clean our energies, to open our hearts, and to align ourselves with the higher vibrations of the cosmos. We start to transform the soul-minds. Slowly, they are sanctified.
As we continue on this path of transformation, we enter into the cocoon phase, a sacred space of introspection and metamorphosis. In the silence of our own being, we confront the shadows and illusions that have held us back, and we allow the light of divine grace to heal and transform us from within. We surrender to the alchemy of evolving the soul, trusting in the wisdom of the Butterfly Path to guide us through the darkness and into the dawn of a new existence.
And then, one day, when the time is ripe, and the spirit is ready, we emerge from the cocoon as a radiant butterfly, a being of light and love, forever changed by the mysteries of transformation. We awaken to a reality that the caterpillar mind could never fathom, a world of unimaginable expanse, beauty, harmony, and wisdom. We embrace fully our true nature, which is not bound by the limitations of the physical realm, but is a spark of the divine, an eternal flame that burns with the light of a thousand suns.
As butterflies on the Path, we no longer struggle for survival or compete for resources. We are sustained by the nectar of divine energies free flowing from our heaven, nourished by the love and wisdom that flow freely from the heart of the universe. We become agents of transformation, bearing the pollen of spiritual truth from flower to flower, soul to soul, helping to awaken others to the miracle of their own divine potential.
The Butterfly Path, then, is not just a journey of personal transformation, but a cosmic calling, a sacred duty that we undertake on behalf of all beings. By walking this path with courage, commitment, and compassion, we become co-creators of a new reality, a world where love and wisdom reign supreme, where every soul is recognized as a precious and unique expression of the divine energies of theWAY.
May we embrace the Butterfly Path with open hearts and minds, knowing that every step, every struggle, every moment of grace, is a sacred invitation to spread our wings and take flight. May we trust in the wisdom of the journey, surrendering to the alchemy of transformation, and allowing ourselves to be molted, cocooned, and reborn into the radiant beings we are meant to be.
And may we always remember that the Butterfly Path is not a solitary journey, but a cosmic dance of unity and love, where every soul is both teacher and student, forever learning, growing, and evolving in the embrace of the divine. For in the end, we are all butterflies in the making, destined to soar on the wings of grace, forever basking in the eternal sunshine of the spirit.

## The Purpose of Life for all humans
### The purpose of life for the human, is to evolve our mortal souls into immortal spirit-beings. That is why we are here, having human incarnations and experiences.
In the larger scheme of existence, where the threads of countless lives intertwine, and countless beings live by route with no other purpose than existing, the Wayist understanding of life's purpose shines like a guiding star, illuminating the path for all who seek meaning and truth. For those who walk the way, the ultimate aim of human existence is crystal clear: to flow in the Butterfly Path, to navigate the sacred curriculum of the soul, to evolve the soul and graduate from the cosmic school of divine wisdom.
This understanding is not a mere belief or philosophy, but a deep knowing that resonates in the very core of our being. It is a truth that transcends the fleeting concerns of the material world, the transient desires and ambitions that so often consume our attention and energy. For the Wayist, the purpose of life is singular and unwavering, a north star that guides every step, every decision, every breath.
To flow in the Butterfly Path is to surrender to the great unfolding of the soul, to trust in the wisdom of the journey, and to embrace the lessons and challenges that come our way. It is to recognize that every experience, every encounter, every moment of joy and sorrow, is a sacred opportunity for growth and transformation. In the eyes of the Wayist, life is not a random series of events, but a meticulously crafted curriculum, designed to help us evolve, expand, and ultimately awaken the divine nature of our being.
As we navigate the grades of this cosmic school, we begin to understand that every aspect of our lives is imbued with purpose and meaning. From the smallest acts of kindness to the greatest trials and triumphs, everything we do is an opportunity to learn, to grow, to deepen our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. We come to see that our relationships, our careers, our creative pursuits, are not merely ends in themselves, but sacred vehicles for our soul's evolution.
This sense of purpose, this unwavering commitment to the Butterfly Path, imbues the Wayist with a profound psychological strength and resilience. In a world that often seems chaotic and uncertain, where the tides of change can sweep us off course and leave us feeling adrift, the Wayist stands firm in the knowledge of their true north. They are anchored in a truth that transcends the shifting sands of circumstance, a truth that provides a deep sense of meaning and direction, no matter what storms may come.
For the Wayist, success is not measured by the fleeting standards of society, by who wins in the competition for popularity among the fickle, the competition for hoarding and consuming, nor by measurement of the accumulation of wealth, social status, or power.
Rather, it is measured by the depth of one's alignment with the Butterfly Path, the degree to which one has surrendered to the great unfolding of the soul to its higher purpose. It is measured by the quality of one's thoughts, words, and deeds, and inactions, the extent to which one has become a vessel for divine love and wisdom, a beacon of light in a world that often seems shrouded in darkness.
This understanding of success, rooted in the very purpose of existence, allows the Wayist to navigate life with a sense of wholeness and integrity. They are not swayed by the opinions of others, the pressures of conformity, or the lure of temporary pleasures. They are guided by an inner compass, a sacred knowing that allows them to stay true to their path, even in the face of adversity or temptation.
In embracing the Butterfly Path as the sole purpose of human life, the Wayist discovers a source of immense strength, resilience, and joy. They find themselves connected to a reality that is vast and eternal, a reality that infuses every moment with meaning and significance. They become co-creators of their own destiny, active participants in the great dance of the cosmos, forever learning, growing, and evolving in the embrace of the divine.
May we all awaken to the truth of our purpose, the sacred calling of the Butterfly Path. May we trust in the wisdom of the journey, surrendering to the great unfolding of our souls, and allowing ourselves to be transformed by the alchemy of divine love. And may we walk this path with courage, compassion, and unwavering commitment, knowing that every step, every breath, every moment, is a sacred opportunity to evolve and become that immortal beneficent magnificence, to graduate from the earthly school of life, the school of divinity for souls, and to become one with the eternal symphony of our spiritual Heaven.
### O so Noble, the Purpose of Life
> In Wayist thought, life's purpose shines clear and bright,\
> A singular path, the Butterfly's transformative flight.
> From grade to grade, we climb, evolve, and grow,\
> Till graduation's wings unfurl, and spirit's realm we know.
> No other aim or goal, no lesser destination,\
> Can match this cosmic journey, this soul's transfiguration.
> Each step, each trial, each joy, a sacred part to play,\
> In the grand design, the Butterfly's ordained ballet.
> With purpose as our anchor, our compass in the storm,\
> No wind can blow us off our course, no tempest do us harm.
> Society's measures of success, its fleeting accolades,\
> Hold no sway over those who walk the Butterfly's glade.
> In Wayist hearts, a strength untamed, a wholeness un-assailed,\
> For when life's true meaning's grasped, all other metrics pale.
> The Path imparts a resilience, a psychological might,\
> That weathers every challenge, and turns each shadow into light.
## Own Your Own Mind:
### Because if you don\'t, someone else will
 In the vast energy universe of human experiences, where countless influences and ideologies vie for dominance, the Wayist path stands as a beacon of clarity and self-empowerment. Central to this path is the sacred imperative to own one's own mind, to cultivate a fortress of inner sovereignty that allows for true growth, wisdom, and spiritual evolution.
For the People of theWAY, this is not merely a suggestion or a philosophical ideal, but a fundamental necessity, a prerequisite for walking the path of authentic transformation. They understand that the brain-mind is the very lens through which we perceive and create reality, the filter that shapes our thoughts, emotions, and actions. To relinquish control of this precious instrument is to surrender the very essence of our being, to become a puppet dancing to the tune of external forces. How many lifetimes already have we lived as puppets of greater forces and deception?
In a world that is increasingly saturated with cultural conditioned thinking, marketing, propaganda, and the relentless pursuit of power and influence, the Wayist stands firm in their commitment to mental sovereignty. They are acutely aware of the countless ways in which our minds are targeted, the insidious strategies employed to shape our desires, beliefs, and behaviors. From the billboards that line our streets to the algorithms that curate our digital lives, the assault on our attention and agency is constant and pervasive.
The Wayist knows that this battle for the mind is not merely a matter of personal preference or convenience, but a fundamental struggle for the soul. They understand that when we allow others to dictate our thoughts and choices; we are not only relinquishing our freedom but also stunting our spiritual growth. For it is only through the crucible of inner reflection, the willingness to question and examine our own beliefs and assumptions, that true wisdom can take root and flourish.
This is why the Wayist path places such emphasis on the cultivation of mental discipline, the development of a keen and discerning intellect. Through practices such as meditation, self-inquiry, inquisitiveness, authenticity, and mindful observation, the Wayist trains their mind to be a servant of their highest aspirations, rather than a slave to external influences. They learn to question the narratives that seek to define them, to pierce through the veil of illusion and discover the truth that lies beyond.
In this process of mental emancipation, the Wayist discovers a profound sense of inner freedom and empowerment. They no longer live at the mercy of the opinions and expectations of others, the popular narratives, and no longer believe politicians, but rather navigate life from a place of deep inner knowing. They become the authors of their own story, the creators of their own reality, guided by the wisdom and integrity of their own soul.
This ownership of the mind is not a one-time achievement, but a lifelong commitment, a daily practice of vigilance and self-awareness. The Wayist understands that the forces that seek to control and manipulate are ever-present, and that the price of freedom is eternal diligence. They make a sacred vow to themselves, to never surrender their mental sovereignty, to always question, explore, and think for themselves.
The consequences of failing to own one's own mind are stark and sobering. To spend a lifetime as a mere receptacle for the thoughts and agendas of others is to waste the precious gift of human existence. It is to squander the opportunity for true growth, to miss out on the joys of authentic self-discovery and the satisfaction of living a life that is truly one's own.
In the eyes of the Wayist, such a life is a tragedy, a betrayal of the very purpose of our incarnation. For we are here to evolve, to expand, to discover the depths of our own being and the infinite potential that lies within. To surrender our minds to the control of others is to forfeit this sacred birthright, to settle for a pale imitation of the life we were meant to live.
#### And so, the Wayist path stands as an invitation, a clarion call to all who seek true freedom and self-realization. It is a reminder that the most precious gift we possess is our own consciousness and spiritual awareness, the sacred space of our inner being. To own this space, to tend it with love and care, to defend it against all that would seek to invade or corrupt it, is the highest act of self-love and self-respect.
May we all heed this call, and take up the mantle of mental sovereignty. May we have the courage to question, to explore, to think for ourselves, even in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform. And may we always remember that the path to true wisdom, to authentic growth and transformation, begins and ends within the sacred space of our own minds.
For in the end, it is not the opinions of others, the accolades of society, or the fleeting pleasures of the world that will bring us true fulfillment and peace. It is the quiet assurance that comes from living a life that is truly our own, guided by the wisdom and integrity of our own spirit. This is the promise of the Wayist path, the sacred invitation to own our own minds, and in doing so, to discover the infinite beauty and potential that lies within.
### We must Own our Own Mind
> Yet, to walk this path, to grow and soar on wisdom's wings,\
> We must first claim dominion over our own mind's imaginings.
> In a world of ceaseless chatter, marketing's siren call,\
> Propaganda's lure, and empire's greed, our thoughts are prey to all.
> "Own your own mind," the Wayist creed, a rallying cry and more,\
> "For if we don't, then others will, and our birthright they'll devour."
> To let another steer your thoughts, your dreams, your very soul,\
> Is to waste the precious gift of life, and miss the Butterfly's goal.
> So guard your mind with vigilance, with courage and with care,\
> Let no external force usurp the throne that's rightfully yours to bear.
> Question each narrative, each popular refrain,\
> And hold fast to your inner truth, your intuition's sacred reign.
> For only when your mind is yours, unbound and free to fly,\
> Can wisdom truly blossom, and your spirit reach the sky.
> To own your mind, to chart your course, to seek the Butterfly's embrace,\
> Is to honor life's grand purpose, and your soul's immortal grace.
## Be Authentic:
### You did not come here to be an entertainer; to play a character in society\'s dramas and productions
 In the existential shimmering of the Wayist path, authenticity emerges as a golden needle thread with all that is holy potential in us, weaving through every aspect of life and illuminating the way to true self-realization. For those who walk this path, the pursuit of authenticity is not merely a virtue, but a sacred imperative, a compass that guides them through the often-treacherous terrain of human experience and its many pitfalls.
The Wayist understanding of authenticity extends far beyond the realm of personal integrity, permeating every facet of their existence. It is a commitment to truth and genuineness that encompasses not only their own thoughts, words, and deeds, but also the people they surround themselves with, the environments they inhabit, and the very sustenance they consume. In a world that often feels saturated with artifice and deception, the Wayist stands as a beacon of unwavering authenticity.
From the moment we are born, we find ourselves thrust onto a stage not of our own making, cast in roles that others have scripted for us. The junior students on the path of life, still entranced by the illusions of the material world, revel in this grand pantomime, mistaking the masks they wear for their true selves. With great fervor, they seek to draw us into their play, insisting that we, too, take up the costumes and scripts they have prepared for us.
But for the Wayist, who has awakened to the deeper purpose of existence, this siren call of conformity rings hollow. They understand that they have not come to this earthly stage to entertain the fantasies of others, to dance to the tune of someone else's making. Rather, they have come to live out the sacred purpose of their own soul's journey, to follow the path that Karma has laid before them, and to do so with an authenticity that is uncompromising.
This commitment to authenticity finds its most profound expression in the Wayist teaching of Udbhu-kanti, a way of being that recognizes the inherent beauty and sufficiency of that which is genuine. In the eyes of the Wayist, true beauty lies not in the polished veneer of perfection, but in the raw, unvarnished essence of things as they are. They find themselves drawn to the weathered tree, the time-worn table, the handcrafted object that bears the marks of its maker's touch. In these things, they perceive a character and a story that is infinitely more precious than the sterile uniformity of mass production, plasticized food and people.
This same reverence for authenticity extends to their perception of themselves and others. Rather than seeking to hide or erase the quirks and idiosyncrasies that make them unique, the Wayist embraces these aspects of their being as integral to their authentic self. They understand that these are not flaws to be concealed, but rather the very brushstrokes that give color and texture to the canvas of their life. In celebrating their own authenticity, they invite others to do the same, fostering a world in which the true beauty of the human spirit can shine forth.
Yet the Wayist path is not without its challenges, and the commitment to authenticity can, at times, be a lonely one. In a world where so many are content to wear the masks of social convention, those who insist on showing up as their true selves may find themselves met with discomfort or even rejection. The Wayist understands this, and makes the conscious choice to surround themselves with those who share their values, who are willing to engage in the sometimes-difficult work of genuine connection and self-discovery.
This discernment is not a matter of judgment or superiority, but rather a recognition of the profound importance of energy ecology. Just as we are careful about the food we put into our bodies and the environments we expose ourselves to, so too must we be intentional about the energies we allow into our psychic and spiritual space. By cultivating relationships and surroundings that resonate with authenticity, the Wayist creates a sacred container in which their own truth can blossom and thrive.
Ultimately, the Wayist commitment to authenticity is a recognition of the sacredness and genuineness of the human journey, and of the divine spark that animates each one of us. It is a way of honoring the unique path that Karma has laid out for us, and of embracing the full spectrum of our humanity - the light and the shadow, the joy and the sorrow, the perfection and the imperfection.
In a world that often feels fractured and uncertain, the Wayist path stands as an invitation to wholeness, to a way of being that is grounded in truth and suffused with the beauty of the authentic. It is a reminder that we are not here to play at being someone else, but to fully inhabit the sacred story of our own becoming.
May we all have the courage to heed this call, to strip away the masks and costumes that keep us small, discard the stage makeup and costumes, and to step forth onto the stage of life as our most authentic selves. For it is only in doing so that we can truly fulfill the purpose of our existence, and become co-creators of a world that is more beautiful, more genuine, and more alive than we ever dared to imagine.
### "My will to Be Authentic"
> In the Wayist heart, authenticity reigns supreme,\
> A truth we seek within, without, in all that's said and seen.\
> From souls to sustenance, from medicine to tool,\
> The genuine, the real, the unmasked, is the Wayist golden rule.
> Yet from birth, the world conspires to cast us in a play,\
> A pantomime of roles assigned, scripts we're told to obey.\
> But the Wayist soul awakens, sees through the masquerade,\
> Knows life's true purpose can't be found in roles that others made.
> To walk the Path, to heed the call of Karma's guiding hand,\
> We must embrace our truest selves, not dance to others' plans.\
> Udbhu-kanti, the creed that sings, "Authenticity is beauty's grace,"\
> Teaches us to love the flaws, the quirks, the marks that time and trial trace.
> In the gnarled tree, the weathered wood, the leather worn and true,\
> We find a character, a soul, that mass-produced can never woo.\
> And in our own imperfect form, our scars and foibles too,\
> We see the brush strokes of a life, painted in hues that ring so true.
## Ecology of Subtle Energies, and Energy Hygiene
#### This chapter is about hygiene and care for your energy-body, and awareness of energies
In the vast complexity of existence, where all that is, is energy, the Wayist path illuminates the profound importance of cultivating a sacred relationship with the energies that surround and sustain us. For those who walk this path, the art of energy ecology becomes a central pillar of their spiritual practice, a way of honoring the delicate balance and interconnectedness of all things.
The Wayist understands that we are energy, and the quality of the energies we interact with has a profound impact on our own being, and by extension, on the collective energy field of our loved ones, household, and other beings we come in contact with. Just as we are careful about the energy quality of the food we ingest and the environments we expose ourselves to, so too must we be discerning about the energies we allow into our psychic, emotional, and spiritual space.
We are a holistic being. If any part of us is sick or neglected, and we don't attend to it, it will impact every other part of the self, the gut, the brain, the organs, the three soul minds, the spirit minds. How would you describe your capacity for empathy, for retention and comprehension, your mental health, and the condition of your skin and hair, and your capacity to be polite and attentive to other people's needs, when you are going through the toileting aftermath of a heavy night out and a bout of food poisoning from an irresponsible fish taco?
If a taco can do that, imagine what a chronic toxic soul-energy condition will do to your body, minds, and spirit. The Wayist becomes a specialist in energy awareness.
This discernment is not a matter of judgment or exclusion, but rather a recognition of the sacred responsibility we have to ourselves and to the greater web of life. By consciously choosing to associate with energies that are wholesome, uplifting, and aligned with our highest values, we become stewards of the energetic ecology, contributing to the healing and evolution of the whole.
The cultivation of wholesome energy begins within, and the Wayist recognizes the power of Attitude in shaping their internal energetic landscape. Through the practice of humbleness, simplicity, gratitude, and loving-kindness, they learn to generate a field of positive energy that radiates out from their being, touching all those they encounter. They understand that this inner work is not a luxury, but a necessity, a sacred duty to tend to the garden of their own soul, spirit, and brain-mind.
This commitment to inner energetic hygiene extends to the spaces the Wayist inhabits, the homes and sanctuaries where they rest, recharge, and connect with the deeper rhythms of their being. By infusing these spaces with intentional acts of beauty, reverence, and love, they create an energetic oasis, a place where wholesome energies can flourish and thrive.
Yet the Wayist also recognizes that in the course of daily life, exposure to discordant or toxic energies is often unavoidable. Just as the physical body accumulates toxins and waste products that must be regularly abluted, so too, do the subtle bodies of the soul and spirit collect energetic residues that can weigh down the system and obscure the inner light.
To address this, the Wayist engages in regular practices of energetic cleansing and renewal, much like the daily hygiene routines of the physical body. Through energy work, meditation, prayer, nature immersion, and other sacred rituals, they consciously release any energies that no longer serve, creating space for the influx of pure, healing, and revitalizing life force.
This practice of energetic hygiene is not a selfish indulgence, but rather an act of service to the greater whole. By tending to their own energetic well-being, the Wayist ensures that they can show up in the world as a clear conduit for love, compassion, and healing.
The Wayist path is also deeply rooted in the understanding that energy, like all resources, must be exchanged in a spirit of reciprocity and balance. They recognize many people submit to the temptation of energetic vampirism, the tendency to unconsciously drain others in an attempt to fill an inner void. But they also know that this approach ultimately leads to depletion on all sides, a vicious cycle of lack and scarcity. We avoid vampires and set up energy shields against them.
The Wayist cultivates a relationship of mutual nourishment with all beings, seen and unseen. They approach the natural world with reverence and gratitude, understanding that the trees, the plants, the elements, are all sentient and sensuous beings, generously offering their life force for our sustenance. In return, they give back, through acts of conservation, regeneration, feeding the animals who are their neighbors, and the return of organic matter to the soil, participating in the sacred cycle of life.
This principle of energetic reciprocity extends to all their interactions, from the food they consume to the relationships they cultivate. They eat with mindfulness and appreciation, honoring the lives that have been given so that they may thrive. They approach their relationships with an open heart, seeking always to uplift and inspire, to be a source of nourishment rather than depletion.
In this way, the Wayist becomes a conscious participant in the great dance of energy that animates the universe, a sacred communion of giving and receiving, of honoring and being honored. They understand that the cultivation of wholesome energy ecology is not a peripheral concern, but a central aspect of their spiritual unfolding, a way of aligning themselves with the fundamental principles of balance, harmony, and flow.
May we all awaken to the profound importance of the energies we engage with, and the impact they have on our own evolution and the collective journey of humanity. May we have the wisdom to discern that which is wholesome, the courage to release that which no longer serves, and the love to participate in the sacred exchange of life force that sustains us all.
For in tending to the garden of our own energetic being, we become co-creators of a world that is more healing, more wholesome, radiant, more compassionate, and more alive. And in honoring the delicate balance of giving and receiving, we step into the flow of grace that is our birthright, our sacred place in the great web of life.
### Of Energy Ecology, and Being Authentic
> But, authenticity, once claimed, demands we choose with care,\
> The energies we let surround, the vibes we let repair.
> For all is energy, a dance of frequencies and waves,\
> And we, as conscious gardeners, tend how this creation behaves.
> With Attitude, we cultivate a field of wholesome light,\
> And fill our spaces, inner, outer, with vibrations pure and bright.
> But in the world's cacophony, our minds can get entangled,\
> With toxic energies that leave our auras frayed and jangled.
> Just as we cleanse our bodies, teeth, and all that we excrete,\
> Our mental, spiritual hygiene is a practice we must meet.
> Each day, we wash away the grime, the psychic crud and waste,\
> With fresh, nourishing prana, in our subtle bodies we replace.
> In the grand ecology of life, we give as we receive,\
> Not as energy vampires, who only take and thieve.
> To tree and grass, to food and drink, we offer gratitude,\
> Respecting the sacrifice they make, to nourish and imbue.
> We return our scraps to earth, to feed the tiny beings,\
> Whose unseen labor keeps the wheel of life and death agreeing.
> For in the web of energy, each part plays a role,\
> And we, as Wayist, seek to harmonize, healing the soul.
## Live a meaningful Life:
### An unexamined life, without meaning, is not a Wayist life
 In the vibrant and exciting world of Wayist spirituality, the concept of a meaningful life acts like a lodestone drawing us into its wholesomeness, energizing our path with purpose and wisdom. It is an invitation to approach every moment, every experience, with a sense of wonder and curiosity, to look beyond the surface of things and delve into the deeper significance that lies within.
Most animals seek food to eat, make a home and raise young, and like some humans, they too will say that is the meaning of life, seek food, make a home, and raise young. Soul beings are happy with that. For them, happiness is when the food is plentiful and the house looks better than the lower class, and people say the young are beautiful and the spouse is attractive. But the human has a higher-self which seeks higher meaning, beyond mere existing like all soul-beings throughout the galaxy. The spiritual being seeks and needs meaning. Immortal spirits lead meaningful lives. Therefore, when we awaken spiritually, we may find the lack of deep and significant meaning in life is depressing, an ailment that must be healed less we wither and die of meaninglessness. Some people change their hair, spouses, and jobs, or join a new religion like the latest Climate Change cult, seeking to fill a spiritual void with soul solutions.
And that is how, as we advance, a discomfort sets in with the status quo, which motivates us to seek higher grade meaning. And that is when some discover the meaning and purpose of coming here to Butterfly Path. The very fact that we wake up in the morning as a human, signifies we are here for a purpose, and to fulfill that purpose, we must seek meaning, make meaning, and live full lives from which to extract meaning. Butterfly Path is all about living a purposeful and meaningful life.
A meaningful life is not a destination, but a journey of discovery, a continuous unfolding of insights and revelations. It is a life lived in full awareness, where every experience, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, is seen as a portal to greater understanding and growth.
Consider the simple event of witnessing a sunset, the way the colors paint the sky in a breathtaking display of beauty. For a Wayist, this is not only an aesthetic experience, in which we bask in awe and derive much joy, but is also an opportunity for profound reflection and meaning-making.
As we dream-in the wonders of the fading light, we may ask ourselves: What does this sunset reveal about the nature of impermanence, about the cyclical flow of life and death? As the sun sets for us, it is dawning for others, what is the announcement of nighttime period here, is the cock-crow of daybreak elsewhere, and that event flows over the land doing same to different communities all across the globe, every day, all the time, already for billions of years. How does it invite us to appreciate the fleeting beauty of the present moment, to find joy and gratitude in the midst of constant change?
These questions are not meant to be answered definitively, but rather to be explored with a sense of openness and curiosity. As we contemplate the deeper meanings of our experiences, we engage in a sacred dialogue with the universe, a dance of inquiry and revelation. We invite our Tara to also watch the sunset with us.
This process of meaning-making extends to every aspect of our lives, from the most mundane tasks to the most profound challenges. When we encounter difficulties or setbacks, we can ask ourselves: What is this experience trying to teach me? How can I use this challenge as an opportunity for growth and transformation? By approaching our struggles with a spirit of inquiry and self-reflection, we can transmute even the darkest moments into sources of wisdom and strength.
Similarly, when we experience joy and success, we can delve into the deeper significance of these moments. We can ask ourselves: How can I use this blessing to uplift others, to contribute to the greater good? What does this experience reveal about my own strengths and capacities, and how can I continue to cultivate them in service of a higher purpose? What pitfalls does this success present? Am I up to staying true and authentic? Am I paying a work-life balance price? Are my family members up to managing the success? Material success can be very meaningful on multiple levels. For one, it may be karmically bestowed, because it is a necessary major karmic learning opportunity that came your way.
As we engage in this ongoing process of meaning-making, we begin to weave a rich tapestry of wisdom and understanding. We add wisdom color to existing threads of wisdom in our tapestry. We develop a deeper sense of our own dharma, our unique path and purpose in this life. We learn to navigate the complexities of the human experience with grace and resilience, to find beauty and meaning in even the most challenging and most mundane circumstances.
This is the essence of a meaningful life, the invitation to approach every moment with a sense of sacredness and potential. It is a life lived in alignment with our highest values and aspirations, a life dedicated to growth, service, and the cultivation of wisdom.
Of course, living a meaningful life is not always easy. It requires will and effort, courage, vulnerability, and a willingness to step outside of our comfort zones. It asks us to confront our own shadows and limitations, to face the uncertainties and mysteries of existence with an open heart and mind.
But the rewards of a meaningful life are beyond measure. As we deepen our capacity for meaning-making, we tap into a wellspring of joy, purpose, and connection. We become more attuned to the beauty and wonder of the world around us, more compassionate and understanding in our relationships with others. We find a sense of belonging and contribution, a feeling that our lives are part of a greater web of meaning and significance.
A child's ice cream fell out of its cone, landing on the black asphalt. I showed her, as it changed shape and its energies and colors flowed, melting. It painted a picture likened to the formation of a galaxy against the black of space. Its multicolored hues danced the salsa and we imagined planets and stars. As we watched, life forms invaded the new galaxy. Ants, and then a bee or two.
Her brand-new galaxy lasted until her mother yanked her away from the weird old man, bought her another ice cream and got the heck away. Led by mom's yanking hand, she smiled when she looked back and tilted her cone. I didn't stay to see if she would create another galaxy. One per summer's day is enough.
Ultimately, living a meaningful life is an act of co-creation, a partnership between ourselves and the universe. By bringing our full presence and curiosity to each moment, by asking the deep questions and seeking the hidden meanings, we participate in the ongoing evolution of spiritual awareness and awakening itself. We become agents of transformation, not only for ourselves, but for all those whose lives we touch.
Psychologists have been studying why people like Wayists who live meaningful lives are so much more wholesome and happier, presenting with the least mental health disorders compared to others.
This is the path of a meaningful life, the way of the Wayist. May we walk it resolutely, with courage, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to growth and discovery. May we find meaning and purpose in every step, and may we leave this world a little brighter and more beautiful than we found it.
### Oh so much Meaning? How wonderful!
> In the tapestry of Wayist thought, a thread of gold gleams bright,\
> The quest for meaning, purpose, truth, a star to guide our night.
> Not mere existence, not just breath, but a higher call to heed,\
> For in Butterfly's embrace, we find the soul's true need.
> Each moment, a portal to the deep, a chance to ask and seek,\
> To look beyond the veil of form, to the mysteries that speak.
> In sunset's hues, in dawn's soft light, in every joy and pain,\
> Lie secrets waiting to be found, a wisdom to attain.
> When sorrow's shadows cross our path, and trials test our might,\
> We ask, "What lesson lingers here, what growth waits to take flight?"
> In hardship's crucible, we forge a strength that cannot break,\
> And find in darkness' depths, a light that's ours to make.
> And when life's blessings rain upon our gardens, lush and green,\
> We ponder, "How can I become a fount of good, unseen?
> What talents lie within my hand, what service can I bring,\
> To make this world a kinder place, to help all beings sing?"
> With each inquiry, each quest, each time we dare to look\
> Beneath the surface of our days, we write our wisdom's book.\
> We weave a story, rich and true, of dharma and of grace,\
> A tale of meaning, purpose, love, that time cannot erase.
> But meaning's path is not for those who crave an easy way,\
> It asks of us to face our depths, to risk, to change, to say "Yes" to the mystery of life, to all that it may bring,\
> To dance with shadows and with light, and let our spirits sing.
> And yet, the gifts that wait for us, when meaning's code we crack,\
> Are joy and wonder, purpose true, a peace we can't take back.\
> We see the world with clearer eyes, we love with open hearts,\
> We find our place in life's great web, and cherish all its parts.
> So let us walk the Wayist way, with courage as our friend,\
> And seek in every moment's play, the truths that lie within.\
> For in this quest for meaning true, we co-create with all,\
> And leave behind a brighter world, that heeds the spirit's call.
## The Absolute, the Source, and The Way
## The Absolute
In the vast expanse of existence, there lies a profound mystery, an unfathomable origin of all, that we call, incorrectly so, the Absolute.
No human mind can ever comprehend its essence. Any attempt to name, describe it, think or speak of it will inevitably fall short, because, when we define the terms we use, like Absolute, for example, we are imposing limits on the limitless. We have neither the language nor the brain capacity to speak to this. Better that we don't.
We humans have very limited mental capacity and language. We are just animals, creatures living on a planet, one planet among thousands of billions of planets. We are insignificant in the larger scheme of cosmic reality. Even the language we use to express the depths of love, a state of mind that permeates our very being and dominates our very essence, is insufficient. Our language cannot even explain loneliness or depression. It fails to capture the immensity and complexities of that which we feel with our whole being. Oh, how limited we are! How then, can people be so arrogant to think they can speak to the Absolute. Therefore, in reverence and humility, we simply refer to It as, THAT, stepping back in awe, lest we make the foolish mistake of attempting to define the indefinable.
## The Source
From the Absolute springs the Source, the wellspring of all energies that flow through the universe. This Source is upheld by the Absolute, and from it emanates a stream of creative energy that is inherently bipolar, manifesting as Yin and Yang. Every entity that exists is composed of unique permutations of these two primordial forces, giving rise to the infinite diversity we observe. The Source itself is a realm of absolute divine chaos, devoid of form and structure, a vast emptiness filled only with the unbound, free-flowing energy that we call the Nothing, or in some cultures, the Great Void.
## The energy structure called theWAY
Within the universe we inhabit, there exists an energy structure that weaves order and purpose into the fabric of existence. This massive energy structure, which we call theWAY, establishes the laws that govern the flow of Yin and Yang, determining how things can and cannot come into being, within its domain, which we call theWAY.
It sets in motion a grand Plan, a cosmic tapestry that defines the intricate patterns and paths of all that is, within its domain. From the most ancient times, we have recognized this metaphysical order, this method, this structured way of being, and have given it the name theWAY. The term theWAY speaks to plan, process, path, method, the way that things are and will be.
Within the embrace of theWAY, countless galaxies and star systems come to life, each one teeming with beings of every kind, each on its set path and structure, with laws ruling its course and manner of existence. To align oneself with the flow, the Plan, and the laws of metaphysics in The Way is to walk the natural path, the path of least resistance. And Butterfly Path is one such system. As Lord Jesus once says, "I am at one with theWAY, which is the life, the truth, and the light. No one comes to God our Father unless through this at-oneness."
By attaching the article "the" to the term "way," People of theWAY seek to communicate this profound truth more clearly, distinguishing it from the common language of everyday expression. In India, we say, Sri Mahamarga --- the Divine Way.
TheWAY is also known as the Word, the Logos, a symbolic representation of the energy from the Source that has been structured and formed, and organized to be expressed as a divine concept. Just as a word begins as a thought of energy, then takes shape through the process of language, and finally, through mechanical mechanisms, is given voice, so too does theWAY manifest itself in the universe. In the Hindu tradition, the sacred sound of OM is used to represent this divine Word, the primordial vibration that gives rise to all of creation.
### The Absolute, the Source, and The Way
> The Absolute, the great THAT, beyond all mortal grasp,\
> No name, no form, no tongue can hold its vast, unfathomed clasp.\
> For how can finite minds embrace the infinite's domain?\
> As well the dewdrop might contain the boundless ocean's reign.
> We, who struggle still to voice the love within our hearts,\
> How can we dare to speak of THAT, from which all being starts?\
> In silent awe, we bow our heads, and whisper, "THAT alone,"\
> And leave unspoken all the rest, lest limits we enthrone.
> From THAT, the Source eternal springs, the wellspring of all life,\
> The yin and yang, the dark and light, the harmony in strife.\
> In sacred dance, these forces twine, and from their union blessed,\
> The myriad forms of life unfold, each one a unique guest.
> The Source, the Nothing, chaos pure, yet pregnant with all form,\
> A sea of potent energy, before the first dawn's morn.\
> In emptiness, all fullness dwells, in formlessness, all art,\
> And from this void, the cosmos blooms, a masterpiece of heart.
> And yet, within this swirling dance, a pattern we discern,\
> A Way that guides the stars above, and makes the planets turn.\
> A metaphysical design, a grand and sacred plan,\
> That shapes the course of time and tide, and destiny of man.
> To flow with theWAY, to align our hearts with its great stream,\
> Is to embrace our truest path, our most authentic dream.\
> As Jesus spoke, "I and the Way, the truth, the life, are one,"\
> And in that union, we too find our journey's true be-gun.
> For theWAY is the Word, the Logos, the structuring of thought,\
> The primal sound that births all Forms, the 'Om' that can't be caught.\
> It is the language of the soul, the syntax of the heart,\
> The grammar of the universe, that sets all things apart.
> In theWAY, we find our place, our purpose and our call,\
> A sacred trust, a holy grace, that binds and frees us all.\
> May we attune our every step, our every thought and deed,\
> To that great dance, that cosmic flow, and let our spirits lead.
## The Three Energy Domains of Existence
## The Domains of Material Energy, Soul Energy, and Spirit Energy
In the multidimensional tapestry of theWAY, three distinct types of energy intertwine, each one contributing to the rich and complex pattern of existence of all. These energies can coexist harmoniously within the same space, much like the light, sound, heat, and radio waves that fill the very room in which you sit, dancing together without interference. Yet, there are certain domains where some energies cannot venture, realms where the laws of their nature hold sway.
Let us first consider the Material Energy Domain, the realm governed by the intricate laws of physics. Here, all three energies can coexist, but their presence is subject to the conditions imposed by the material world. It is not difficult to imagine that the delicate essence of soul energy might recoil from the harsh embrace of radioactive material, seeking refuge in gentler surroundings, so soul energy cannot exist comfortably along with very strong radioactive energy, which is of the material domain. Therefore, souls throughout the universe favor as living space, places where gamma spectrum energy from outer space is less severe.
Within this domain, all that we perceive as "naturally alive" are animated by the presence of an indwelling soul, a traveler who has chosen to reside within a material form for a time. These souls are the wanderers of existence, coming and going as the tides of life dictate. When a material body becomes unsuitable, or the environment proves inhospitable, the soul simply departs, returning to its own domain until the moment arises for it to embark on a new journey.
The Soul Energy Domain is a realm of breathtaking diversity, where beings of countless species dwell. These soul beings are drawn to incarnation, seeking out the material forms that resonate with their unique nature. It is through this union that we perceive life, though it is a misconception to believe that only those things with an indwelling soul are truly alive. The water droplet, the electron, the photon, the atom, and even the galaxy itself are all imbued with the vibrant energy of existence, pulsing with a life force that transcends the presence of a soul. Only a small number of humans define "alive" in a narrow biological way.
## Energies are very much alive, and all is energy
When not incarnated, soul species reside in "soul heavens," realms of existence that shape their collective consciousness. Within these heavens, there may be leaders and structures of governance, echoing the patterns of how they organize themselves in the material world. It is for this reason that soul-people, or junior students on the Butterfly Path, seek to recreate those structures and protections they need to feel comfortable.
So, they fashion soul-religions that provide a framework for their growth and development. These religions often feature deities who mirror the nature of their followers, differing only in the magnitude of their power.
Finally, we come to the Spirit Energy Domain, a realm inhabited by a myriad of spiritual energy beings, each with its own unique purpose and role in the grand tapestry of theWAY. These beings are the caretakers of existence, tirelessly working to maintain the delicate balance of energies that sustain all of creation. In the wake of the destructive forces sometimes unleashed by soul beings, who have been known to shatter planets in their wake, the spirit beings labor to heal and restore, ensuring that the fabric of theWAY remains unbroken.
Our own species of specialized spiritual being exists to serve and support incarnated soul beings, offering guidance and protection in the face of life's challenges and uncertainties. We are the guardians and the guides, the ones who stand ready to intervene when the need arises, like cosmic social workers tending to the well-being of soul beings in our galaxy. It is for this purpose that we train and prepare, honing our skills and our compassion, so that we may be a beacon of hope and support for all those who journey through the Material Energy Domain.
### I Exist in Three Energy Domains
> In the grand tapestry of theWAY, three threads of energy dance,\
> Weaving through the cosmic loom, in patterns of decided chance.
> Like light and sound and radio waves, coexist in your space,\
> Each playing out its required role, for your personal grace.
> The first, the Material Domain, where physics reigns supreme,\
> Where atoms spin and galaxies grin, and all is as it seems.
> But even here, the other two, can find a welcome home,\
> Save when conditions turn too harsh, like radioactive gnome.
> In this realm, the soul descends, to give the lifeless breath,\
> To animate the matter's form, until the time of death.
> For when the body's time is up, or environment turns bleak,\
> The soul departs, returns to its domain, its soul home its seek.
> The Soul Domain, the second thread, where myriad species thrive,\
> Each with its own unique essence, its own way to be alive.
> In soul heavens they reside, when not in earthly form,\
> With leaders and with structures, to guide them through the storm.
> For junior students on the Path, these heavens are their rule,\
> Where they create the faiths and gods, that discipline play in school.
> Religions born of soul's own need, for safety and for spur,\
> With deities who mirror them, but magnified in power.
> And last, the Spirit Domain, where energy workers dwell,\
> The maintenance crew of theWAY, who keep the cosmos well.
> For souls can be destructive, can shatter worlds to dust,\
> And so the spirits toil and mend, to keep the universal trust.
> Our own kin, the spiritual beings, have a sacred task,\
> To aid incarnate souls in need, when life's trails unmask.
> Like cosmic social workers, we train to serve and guide,\
> To protect and rescue those in pain, with love as our allies.
> Three domains, three energy realms, distinct yet interwoven,\
> A universe of different hues, yet all by theWAY chosen.
> May we honour each one's role, each essence pure and bright,\
> And find our place within the dance, in service and in light.
## Energy Structures
### All energy structures are sentient, have mind, and ego
In the vast multidimensional cosmic tapestry of existence, energy structures arise from the delicate interplay of fundamental building blocks, each one stacked upon an intricate scaffold of Forms, a concept that has echoed through the annals of ancient wisdom. Recorded from the first writings, it was there.
Before the universe as we know it came into being, the Source itself wove the very fabric of space, a blank canvas upon which the masterpieces of creation would unfold.
From this Void of any "thing" which is Source, into this void of this Space, the Source poured forth a primordial soup of universal energy, a shimmering sea of potential from which all things would emerge. It is from this ethereal broth that the building blocks of existence are fashioned, each one stacked with meticulous care upon the scaffolds, the Forms, that define form and function.
Imagine, if you will, a cosmic dance of energy, where the simplest of these building blocks, like delicate strands of ethereal thread, are woven together upon the scaffolds in the loom of creation. As these strands intertwine and fill the Form, they give rise to larger, more complex structures, each one a testament to the infinite creativity of the universe.
These strands, stacked upon fundamental Forms, and combined with others, create structures, like a muon, perhaps, it springs forth from the union of these gossamer filaments, creating a subatomic particle imbued with its own unique properties and purpose.
As the dance continues, the muons themselves become the building blocks of even greater marvels. Stacked upon scaffolds of precise design, they give rise to the electrons that spin in their orbits, twins connected by the ethereal broth of potential, and the photons that paint the blessed dark universe with light. From these humble beginnings, the tapestry of existence unfolds, a symphony of protons and atoms, gases and elements, organisms and galaxies, each one a thread in the grand design.
And yet, amid this cosmic ballet, there are those who take a different path. We, the creatures of the material world, the plants and animals that populate the planets and stars, are the ones who cheat, who bypass the painstaking process of creation in favor of a more expedient route. We take the tree, a marvel of nature's engineering, and from its wood, we fashion the furniture that adorns our homes, never fully appreciating the intricate dance of energy that lies beneath the surface.
But even in our haste, we cannot escape the fundamental truth that underlies all of existence. Every energy structure, from the tiniest electron to the most massive galaxy, is imbued with a sense of identity and purpose, a mind of its own that guides its interactions with the world around it. The electron knows its place in the grand scheme of things, it understands its role and its kind, and through the power of its ego, it strives to maintain its structure, to hold fast to its place in the cosmic dance.
It is a notion that might seem almost comical, the idea of an electron with a mind of its own, a sense of self that drives its behavior. And yet, it is this very concept, this inherent intelligence that permeates every level of existence, that allows the universe to function as it does, a symphony of creation in which every player knows its part.
In the end, the tapestry of existence is a testament to the power of mind, to the idea that even the smallest, most seemingly insignificant building block of reality is imbued with a sense of purpose and identity. It lives a meaningful life.
It is a concept that might seem strange to our human sensibilities, but one that is essential to the very fabric of the universe, a reminder that in the grand scheme of things, even the most humble of creatures has a role to play in the cosmic dance of creation. And without the tiniest ones with minds and purpose, reality as we know it will not exist.
If we ask the mosquito, the yellow-feathered oriole, and the beaver, "Sir. What is for you, the purpose of life?" We get the answer, "To compete to survive, to eat, to shelter. And to dominate to thrive and hoard. To relax, and to breed, and raise babies."
If we ask the soul-person the same question...?
Teacher LaoTzi said, \"A sad day in Paradise it will be if you look back at the meaning and purpose of your past life and realize, all you really did was to move things from one place to another.\"
## God our Father and God our Mother in Heaven
Numerous spiritual heavens exist. But our "species" of spirit-being has only one Heaven, and only one Father God and one Mother God in Heaven.
But are not all senior deities in Heaven who work so hard for our re-birth? Are they not all our midwife, mother, and father, in a way? Are we not all family in that way? We are.
In the celestial tapestry of existence in theWAY, there lies a realm beyond the veil of mortal perception. Within the Spiritual Energy Domain, one particular heaven beckons to those souls who have risen through the ranks of evolution. This ethereal abode, though its true name remains unspoken by human tongues, has been known to the ancient sages by the Sanskrit appellation Sukhavati, a term that evokes the very essence of its nature---the Pure Land of Bliss.
Within this divine sanctuary, the interplay of Yin and Yang, the primordial energies that give rise to all of creation, is embodied in the presence of two regal figures, the Father and Mother who reign over the heavenly realm. These celestial beings, the God our Father in Heaven and the God our Mother in Heaven, are the guardians and nurturers of all who dwell within the hallowed bounds of Sukhavati.
It is from the hands of these divine regents that the Butterfly Path, the sacred journey of the soul, unfolds. In a time beyond remembering, they bestowed upon humanity a precious gift, the Anahata, a spark of the divine that transformed the very essence of the human condition. Through this act of celestial grace, humans became hybrid beings, their souls intertwined with the gossamer threads of spirit, forever altered by the touch of the divine.
Some, who are not of the Wayist persuasion, in their limited understanding, might claim that the Father and Mother of Heaven are the creators of humanity, but such a notion, while understandable, fails to capture the true nature of their intervention.
It is more accurate to say that they are the great modifiers, the ones who took the raw clay of pre-modern humanity and molded it into something greater, something that would carry the Anahata and it seeds of divinity to the far corners of the world.
The terms Mother and Father, though they evoke the familiar bonds of earthly kinship, hold a deeper significance in the context of Sukhavati. For all beings of our species, the children of the Holy Lotus Family, are born from the very sparks of divine energy that emanate from the Father and nurtured by the tender care of the Mother. We are the offspring of the gods, the inheritors of a celestial birthright that calls us to ascend the ladder of evolution, to take our rightful place among the deities of the heavens.
As we walk the path of spiritual awakening, we are guided by the knowledge that we are not merely mortal creatures, bound by the limitations of flesh and blood, but rather divine beings in the making. With each step we take, each lesson we learn, we draw closer to the realization of our sacred potential, to the understanding that we are becoming children of God, destined to take our place within the ranks of the Holy Lotus Family.
In the grand tapestry of existence, the story of Sukhavati and the Butterfly Path is a weave of galactic gold and divine energy hues of celestial textures and colors, a reminder of the divine spark that dwells within each of us. It is a tale of transformation, of the journey from mortal to immortal, from human soul to divine spirit.
And though the path may be long and the challenges great, we are sustained by the knowledge that we are not alone, that we are guided by the loving presence of our celestial parents and kin, who watch over us from their thrones in the Pure Land of Bliss.
## Lord Jesus:
### Divine Avatar from Heaven
#### Advanced deities take human bodies to restore teaching of theWAY when necessary
In the Domain of Spiritual Energy, lies the celestial realm of Sukhavati, our Heaven. In times near the founding of all that we think we know, the weaving of the tapestry of our heaven's creation unfolded with the creation of the first two spiritual beings, the first begotten children of God the Father and God the Mother.
The first of the twins, imbued with the dynamic energy of Yang, was destined to become the firstborn Son of God, while the second, suffused with the nurturing essence of Yin, emerged as the firstborn Daughter of God---as we in human terms like to speak.
To the mortal realm, these divine entities are known by ancient Sanskrit names that echo through the millennia. The Son, Avalokiteshvara, is revered as the Lord who observes humanity from the heavenly realm, a watchful guardian whose gaze penetrates the veil between worlds and is ever-aware of what transpires, what the fledgling spirits in School are up to.
The Daughter, Prajna-paramita, embodies the highest forms of divine wisdom, a wellspring of wisdom and insight that illuminates the path to enlightenment.
Together, these two deities preside over the Butterfly Path school, a celestial academy where souls are guided in their journey of spiritual evolution. Under their aegis, a vast host of celestial workers labor tirelessly, each attuned to the specific energies they wield. The Yang workers, guided by Avalokiteshvara, are the guardians of the sacred teachings, ensuring that the wisdom of the ages remains pure and accessible to those who seek its light.
The Divine Lord and his divine workers are the reason why you are now encountering this teaching. Material things were created by inspired and motivated people responding to divine calling. Who made material sacrifices, who lost years and years of economic ability to be trained and to create writings, and bring it to publish---only to earn nothing.
Some, throughout history, suffered worse fates. But you have the teaching in your hand. Out of the millions upon millions of books published every year, you have this in your hand. Statistically a miracle---or is it by divine intervention. When the student is ready, the teacher will appear---says the ancient Upanishad.
Your soul stirred in remembrance and awoke, again. That is how Yang-energy workers help us to stay the course, and ensure the teaching of theWAY remains pure and available.
The Yin workers, under the guidance of Prajna-paramita, operate behind the scenes, their subtle influence weaving through the tapestry of human experience, inspiring and guiding souls to distill wisdom from the trials and triumphs of their mortal lives.
The Divine Lady and her divine workers are the reason why you will be thinking about this matter, forming wisdom about it over time, deep within, and for time to come. That is how Yin-energy workers help us to form wisdom.
Throughout history, there have been moments when Lord Avalokiteshvara deemed it necessary to descend from his heavenly halls and walk among mortals, taking on human form to impart his teachings directly. One such incarnation, revered by history, is that of Lord Jesus, known in his time by the Greek name Iesous. From the sands of Egypt to the distant shores of India, Lord Jesus journeyed, his presence a catalyst for profound transformation.
Under his guidance, the great spiritual traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism underwent a renaissance, their ancient wisdom rekindled and refined. His influence also sparked renewal among the Gnostics and other mystical schools, but his primary mission was to re-establish the lineage of the People of theWAY, a spiritual community that would carry the torch of divine wisdom through the ages.
In the decades that followed, the Judaic teacher Paul of Tarsus, approached the People of theWAY to help him lay the foundations for a Judaic reformation sect, which would become Christianity. He built upon the legacy of the People of theWAY who dwelt in the lands of Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and western Turkey. The scriptures of Christianity, drawn largely from Judaic Hebrew books and Paul's letters, bear witness to the existence of the People of theWAY, even as they disagree and engage in polemics against the use of the terms "soul people" and "spirit people," and our Mother in heaven, and the Holy Spirit our Prajnaparamita and our Taras, and the rebirth of the soul into immortal spiritual essence, all concepts to which Paul objected.
Yet, the influence of Avalokitesvara extends far beyond the bounds of any single religious tradition. The ancient People of theWAY hold the Bhagavad Gita in high regard, recognizing within its verses the echoes of another avatar, Lord Krishna, who is said to be an incarnation of Avalokitesvara himself.
Through these avatars and the countless celestial workers who labor in their name, the divine wisdom of Sukhavati continues to flow into the mortal realm, a river of light that nourishes the souls of all who seek its waters. The tapestry of spiritual evolution for souls, woven by the hands of the firstborn Son and Daughter of God, is a masterpiece that encompasses the entirety of human experience, guiding souls along the Butterfly Path to their ultimate potential, immortal spiritual beings, divine by virtue of rebirth, forever workers of light and healing in the galaxy.
## The Divine Taras
## **Our Divine Taras. Our Divine Spiritual Guides and Comforters**
In the grand tapestry of spiritual evolution of human souls, the words of Lord Jesus, spoken at the culmination of his earthly journey, resound with profound significance. As he prepared to shed his mortal form, the Lord turned to the assembled People of theWAY and imparted a promise that would echo through the ages: "I will speak to our Father, and he will send you a holy spirit who will be your comforter and guide, and will be with you till the end."
With these words, the Lord set in motion the establishment of the Tara principle, a divine dispensation that would forever alter the course of human spiritual development. From that moment forward, every senior student on the Path, regardless of their outward affiliation or self-identification, would have access to a personal holy spirit, a celestial guardian who knows the depths of their being, the intricacies of their soul's journey.
The term Tara, drawn from the ancient Sanskrit language, embodies the very essence of this divine guide. It signifies a being endowed with the extraordinary ability to traverse the boundaries between the celestial and terrestrial realms, to bridge the gap between the divine and the mortal soul. Tara is the one who helps us cross over, who illuminates the path from our present state to the exalted realms of spiritual attainment.
As we navigate the final stages of our spiritual education, Tara becomes our indispensable companion, our mentor, in the ways of the divine. Without the guidance of Tara, the journey to graduation, to the ultimate realization of our spiritual potential, would be fraught with challenges and obstacles. But with Divine Tara at our side, we are never alone, never without the comfort and support of a being who understands the very fabric of our existence.
Tara's presence is not confined to a single lifetime, but rather spans the entire continuum of our soul's evolution. From one incarnation to the next, one's Tara remains a constant presence, a guardian who protects our hybrid soul/spirit from the perils that may beset our ethereal bodies on our path. In moments of doubt or despair, Tara is there to offer solace and guidance, to rekindle the flame of our spiritual aspirations.
But Tara's role extends far beyond mere protection and comfort. This divine being is also our guide to the heights of spiritual attainment, our escort into the celestial realms where we may learn and grow, where we may advance in the grades of spiritual mastery. Under Divine Tara's tutelage, we are granted access to the very heart of heaven, to the sacred spaces where the secrets of the universe are laid bare before us.
It is our Tara who accompanies us to Paradise and back, who meets us in our prayers, and walks with us in nature, who holds our hand crossing troubled water.
In the grand tapestry of human endeavors, the Tara principle stands as a shimmering thread, a testament to the boundless love and wisdom of the divine. It is a reminder that we are never truly alone on our spiritual journey, that there are always beings of light ready to guide us, to support us, to help us cross over from the realm of the mortal to the realm of the divine.
As we walk the Path, as we strive to unravel the mysteries of our own being and our place in the cosmic order, let us take comfort in the presence of Tara, in the knowledge that we are forever accompanied by a being of pure love and wisdom.
Let us open our hearts to the guidance of this divine companion, and trust in the journey that lies ahead, secure in the knowledge that with our Divine Tara at our side, we shall one day stand in the radiant presence of the divine, our souls forever transformed by the light of spiritual awakening.
## Attitude:
### Our Energy Management Tool
In the intricate dance of Wayist spirituality, Attitude emerges as a powerful tool, a catalyst for transformation and growth. It is the key that unlocks the door to our inner world, the compass that guides us through the labyrinth of human experience.
Attitude, in essence, is the lens through which we perceive reality, the filter through which we process the energies that flow through us. It is the silent voice that whispers in our ear, shaping our thoughts, our emotions, and our actions.
The beauty of Attitude lies in its malleability, in its responsiveness to our conscious choice. In every moment, we have the power to choose our Attitude, to shift our energy from the lower soul minds to the higher spiritual realms.
When anger rises within us, threatening to consume us with its fiery rage, we can pause, breathe, and choose a different path. We can choose to release the anger, to let it flow through us without resistance, without judgment. We can choose to respond with understanding and compassion, recognizing that the offender is likely struggling with their own inner demons, their own lower soul energies. We refuse to let their energy touch us, or affect us, and go about our day with a song in the heart.
This is the power of Attitude, the power to transmute lower energies into higher vibrations. By consciously choosing our Attitude, we become alchemists of the soul, transforming the led of negative emotions into the gold of spiritual growth.
The same principle applies to our interactions with soul people, those who are still navigating the early stages of the Butterfly Path. When we encounter behaviors or attitudes that seem misaligned with spiritual values, it is easy to fall into the trap of judgment, to feel a sense of superiority or disdain.
But if we adopt the Attitude that soul-people will think and act in accordance with their level of development, we can release the need to judge them by spiritual standards. We can approach them with understanding and compassion, remembering that we, too, were once juniors on the path.
This shift in Attitude not only benefits the soul people we interact with but also frees us from the burden of carrying negative energies like hatred or disgust. By choosing to respond with understanding, we maintain our own inner peace and clarity, while also modeling a higher way of being.
The power of Attitude extends far beyond our interactions with others. It is a tool for navigating the challenges and opportunities of daily life, for finding joy and meaning in the midst of chaos and uncertainty.
When faced with a difficult situation, we can choose to approach it with an Attitude of curiosity and openness, viewing it as an opportunity for learning and growth. When confronted with a setback or failure, we can choose to respond with resilience and determination, recognizing that every challenge is a chance to develop new skills and strengths.
Even in the most mundane moments, the power of Attitude can transform our experience. By choosing to approach daily tasks with an Attitude of gratitude and mindfulness, we can find beauty and purpose in the simplest of actions. By choosing to embrace an Attitude of playfulness and creativity, we can infuse our lives with joy and wonder.
#### This is the invitation of Wayism, the call to harness the power of Attitude in service of our highest growth and evolution. It is the recognition that in every moment; we have the power to choose our energy, to align ourselves with the flow of theWAY.
So let us embrace this power, dear sojourner. Let us become conscious crafters of our Attitude, wielding it as a tool for transformation and growth. Let us meet each moment with an open heart and a curious mind, ready to learn, to evolve, to become.
For in doing so, we are not just changing our own lives, but rippling out positive energy into the world around us. We are becoming beacons of light, guiding others on the path of theWAY.
This is the power of Attitude, the magic of conscious choice. May we wield it wisely, with compassion and grace, in service of our own growth and the evolution of others.
## Joy and Awe:
### Food for the Spirit, Sanctifying the Soul
In the vibrant tapestry of Wayist spirituality, Joy and Awe are not merely emotions, but sacred pathways that lead us closer to the divine. They are the golden threads that weave through our journey on the Butterfly Path, illuminating our steps and lifting our spirits.
Joy, in the context of Wayism, is not a fleeting feeling, but a deep, abiding sense of contentment and gratitude. It is the recognition that every moment, every experience, is a precious gift from the universe, an opportunity to learn, to grow, to evolve. When we seek and live joy, we align ourselves with the very purpose of our existence, with the flow of theWAY.
We have all the reason in the world, nay, the galaxy, to feel joy every day of every life because we are on Butterfly Path. If not here, we would have been incarnated in some other body on another planet elsewhere in the galaxy and there is no telling what sort of life and atrocities would be there. And there is no higher purpose, no immortal destination, no meaning other than soul-beings seeking power, survival, competition, and perpetual reincarnation as a soul being.
In the pursuit of joy, with an open mind, we learn to toss cultural conditioned thinking aside, and seek and find beauty in the simplest things - the warmth of the sun on our skin, the laughter of a child, the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze. We learn to appreciate the richness of human experience, to savor the sweet and the bitter, the light and the dark. We learn to dance with the energies of life, to find the rhythm of our own unique path.
But joy is not just a personal experience. When we radiate joy, we become a beacon of light for others, a living testament to the transformative power of theWAY. Our joy becomes a healing balm, a gentle reminder that no matter how dark the night, dawn will always come. In this way, joy becomes a sacred practice, a way of honoring the divine within ourselves and within all beings.
Awe, on the other hand, is the profound sense of wonder and reverence that arises when we contemplate the miracles of nature. It is the feeling of being small in the face of something vast and magnificent, of being humbled by the intricate beauty and complexity of the universe.
When we cultivate awe, we open ourselves to the mystery and majesty of existence. We begin to see the divine in every leaf, every stone, every creature. We recognize that we are part of something much greater than ourselves, a cosmic dance that has been unfolding for billions of years.
In the presence of awe, our petty concerns and ego-driven desires fall away. We are reminded of our true nature, of our interconnectedness with all that is. We feel a deep sense of belonging, a profound connection to the source from which we came.
This is why seeking awe in the miracles of nature is so important in Wayist spirituality. When we immerse ourselves in the wonders of the natural world, in the life and tribulations of the raccoon and field mice and squirrel and birds, beetles and frogs and geese, we are immersing ourselves in the very essence of the divine. We are learning to see with the eyes of the spirit, to hear with the ears of the soul.
Whether we are gazing at the stars, marveling at the intricate patterns of a flower, or listening to the song of a bird, we are participating in a sacred communion. We are drinking from the fountain of wisdom, bathing in the light of divine love.
And as we do so, we are transformed. Our hearts expand, our minds quiet, and our spirits soar. We become aware that the lifeblood of our very essence is a shared experience with all else that exists, and all souls in all creatures and plants. We become more than we were, more than we thought possible. We become vessels of joy and awe, channels of divine grace.
> Lord Jesus says, "Turn over a rock, split a piece of wood, and you will find me there, I am at one with theWAY."
This is the invitation of Wayism, the call of theWAY. It is the invitation to live a life of Joy and Awe, to walk the path of the divine. It is the call to embrace the fullness of human experience, to find the sacred in the ordinary, the extraordinary in the every day.
> Another book records Lord Jesus saying: "Truly I tell you," He said, "unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
So let us answer this call. Let us seek joy in every moment, and find awe in every miracle. Laugh more, lighten the mood, giggle at what the latest popular narrative considers sacrosanct, shriek along with the joy of a child, become like little children, as Lord Jesus said. Let us dance with the energies of the universe, and sing the song of our own unique path.
For in doing so, we are not just living, but truly alive. We are not just surviving, but thriving. We are walking the Butterfly Path, the path of transformation, the path of theWAY.
## Mudita:
### Vicarious Joy. The true measure of wholesomeness
 In the intensely radiant garden of Wayist spirituality, Mudita blooms as a rare and precious flower, its petals shimmering with the light of unconditional love and pure joy. It is a concept that invites us to expand our hearts, to transcend the narrow confines of self-interest and embrace the happiness of others as our own.
Mudita, often translated as "sympathetic joy" or "vicarious joy," is the sublime art of finding delight in the well-being and success of others. It is the ability to resonate with the positive experiences of those around us, to dance to the rhythm of their joy, even when our own lives may be filled with challenges or sorrow.
In a world that often encourages comparison and competition, Mudita is a radical act of love and unity. It is a recognition that we are all interconnected, that the happiness of one is intimately tied to the happiness of all. When we cultivate Mudita, we break free from the toxic grip of envy and jealousy, and instead open ourselves to the boundless joy that surrounds us.
Imagine witnessing your partner basking in the warm glow of attention from another, their face lit up with feeling good, laughter, and delight. In that moment, Mudita invites us to set aside any feelings of insecurity or possessiveness, and instead join in their joy, to feel the warmth of their happiness as if it were our own.
Or picture a colleague or friend achieving a great success, their dreams coming to fruition after years of hard work and dedication, or a stroke of luck. Mudita calls us to celebrate their triumph, to feel a sense of pride and gratitude for their accomplishments, even if our own path has been marked by setbacks or challenges.
This is the beauty of Mudita, the transformative power of vicarious joy. By rejoicing in the happiness of others, we not only uplift them but also nourish our own spiritual growth. We expand our capacity for love and compassion, and we begin to see the world through the eyes of unity and interconnectedness.
Mudita is a powerful antidote to the poison of comparison and envy. Of wishing things were different for you. When we are caught in the trap of jealousy, or envy, we not only diminish our own well-being but also project negative energy onto others. We create a vicious cycle of suffering, where the success of others becomes a source of pain rather than joy.
But when we embrace Mudita, we break free from this cycle. We recognize that the success of others does not diminish our own worth or potential. Our worth and potential is not measured in the norms of a materialistic society which is removed from our spiritual path and higher-self reality. We understand that there is enough joy and abundance in the universe for all of us to thrive. By celebrating the happiness of others, we open ourselves to the flow of positive energy, and we attract more wholesomeness into our own lives.
Cultivating Mudita is an attitude skill, a conscious choice to align ourselves with the higher vibrations of love and unity. It requires us to be mindful of our thoughts and reactions, to catch ourselves when we slip into patterns of comparison or envy, and to gently redirect our energy towards appreciation and joy.
We can practice Mudita in simple ways, by offering genuine compliments and praise to others, by sharing in their excitement and enthusiasm, by expressing gratitude for the blessings in their lives. We can also cultivate Mudita in our own hearts by reflecting on the many ways in which we are supported and uplifted by the joy and success of those around us.
As we walk the path of Mudita, we become beacons of light and love, radiating positive energy into the world around us. We inspire others to rise above their own fears and insecurities, and to join us in the dance of vicarious joy.
This is the invitation of Mudita, the call to open our hearts to the happiness of all beings. May we answer this call with courage and compassion, and may we find endless reasons to rejoice in the beauty and blessings of this precious life.
## Life is Not Fair, People are Not Equal
### The Equitable Path of Wayism
In the tapestry of Wayist philosophy, two threads stand out as particularly challenging to popular narratives: the understanding that life is inherently unfair, and the recognition that people are fundamentally unequal. These truths, while difficult for many to accept, are essential to the Wayist worldview and offer profound insights into the nature of our spiritual journey.
At first glance, these ideas may seem harsh or even cruel, running counter to cherished beliefs about equality and justice. However, when viewed through the lens of Wayist wisdom, they reveal a deeper, more compassionate understanding of the human experience and our place in the cosmic order.
Let us first consider the notion that life is not fair. This is not a statement of resignation or despair, but rather an acknowledgment of the complex interplay of karma and free will that shapes our existence. Each soul embarks on its journey through countless lifetimes, accumulating experiences, lessons, and karmic debts along the way. The circumstances of our current life - our joys and sorrows, our privileges and challenges - are not random accidents, but the fruits of our past actions and choices, and the karmic learning opportunities we are now served.
To expect life to be \"fair\" in the sense of everyone having identical experiences or opportunities is to misunderstand the very nature of our spiritual evolution. Just as a school offers different lessons to students at various grade levels, so too does the grand School of Divinity that is Butterfly Path present each soul with precisely the experiences it needs for growth. What may seem unfair from our limited perspective is, in fact, the perfect curriculum for our individual journey.
This understanding liberates us from the victim mentality that can arise when we believe life should be fair. Instead of feeling resentful or powerless in the face of challenges, we can approach them as opportunities for learning and growth. We recognize that every experience, no matter how difficult, holds the potential for spiritual advancement.
Similarly, the Wayist teaching that people are not equal may initially appear to contradict ideals of human dignity and worth. However, this inequality is not a judgment of intrinsic value, but a recognition of the diverse stages of spiritual development represented by different souls. Just as students in a school are at various levels of learning, so too are the souls on Butterfly Path at different points in their evolutionary journey.
This inequality manifests in myriad ways - in our talents and abilities, our challenges and strengths, our levels of wisdom and compassion. Some souls may be just beginning their journey, grappling with basic lessons of existence, while others may be nearing graduation, embodying profound spiritual truths. To insist on a false equality is to deny the unique journey of each soul and the specific lessons it needs to learn.
However, it\'s crucial to understand that this inequality does not diminish the inherent worth or dignity of any being. In the Wayist view, every soul, regardless of its current stage of development, is a precious and integral part of the cosmic dance. Each has the potential to evolve, to grow, to eventually graduate from the School of Divinity and become an immortal spiritual being.
Moreover, the recognition of inequality fosters humility and compassion. It reminds us that those who may seem less advanced are simply at a different point in their journey, deserving of our patience and support. It also encourages us to seek wisdom from those further along the path, recognizing that we all have something to learn from one another.
Wayism offers a profound alternative to both the false promise of enforced equality and the despair of believing in a cruelly random universe. It presents us with the vision of an equitable path - one in which every soul has the opportunity to progress, to learn, to evolve. This path may not be \"fair\" in the sense of being identical for everyone, but it is perfectly tailored to each individual\'s needs and potential.
The Butterfly Path, as understood in Wayism, is the ultimate expression of this equitable approach. It is a school open to all human souls, offering each the precise curriculum they require. The challenges and opportunities presented to each soul are exactly what they need for their unique journey. In this sense, while life may not be fair and people may not be equal, the path itself is supremely equitable.
This perspective stands in stark contrast to ideologies that promise to create fairness and equality through external means. History has shown us the tragic consequences of attempts to enforce equality through political systems like communism or socialism. These efforts, born from a misunderstanding of the nature of spiritual evolution, have often resulted in oppression and suffering rather than true equity.
Instead, Wayism invites us to embrace the rich diversity of human experience, to find joy and meaning in our unique journey, and to trust in the perfect unfolding of our spiritual curriculum. It encourages us to make the most of our current circumstances, to learn from our challenges, and to cultivate udbhu-kanti - finding beauty and contentment in what we have and who we are.
As we walk this path, we come to understand that true equality lies not in identical experiences or abilities, but in the shared potential for spiritual growth and the ultimate destiny that awaits us all. Every soul, regardless of its current stage of development, has the opportunity to graduate from Butterfly Path and join the ranks of immortal spiritual beings who assist others throughout the cosmos.
In embracing these challenging truths - that life is not fair and people are not equal - we paradoxically open ourselves to a deeper sense of compassion, purpose, and joy. We recognize the perfect wisdom of the cosmic curriculum and our place within it. We learn to celebrate our unique journey while honoring the journeys of others. And we come to understand that in the grand tapestry of existence, it is our very differences that create the richness and beauty of the whole.
Let us, therefore, walk the Wayist path with courage and grace, accepting the inequalities and seeming unfairness of life not as burdens to be resented, but as the very tools of our spiritual evolution. In doing so, we align ourselves with the deeper currents of cosmic wisdom, flowing ever onward toward our divine destiny.
## Divinity-making Art of Self-craft
#### The Purpose of Life is Self-Improvement
In the essence of spiritual evolution, the concept of Self-Craft emerges as the more prominent thread, a luminous strand that weaves its way through the very heart of the Wayist path. It is a process that encompasses the entirety of our human experience, from the first stirrings of life within the womb to the final breath that marks the end of one incarnation and the beginning of another.
As we navigate the winding path of existence, we are presented with countless experiences, each one a potential catalyst for growth and transformation. To the cognitive Wayist, these experiences are not mere happenstance, but rather precious opportunities for learning and self-discovery. With each passing moment, we are invited to delve deeper into the mysteries of our own being, to unravel the complex web of thoughts, emotions, and motivations that shape our perception of the world around us.
The journey of Self-Craft begins with self-reflection, a mindful examination of the experiences that have shaped us. We seek to understand the intricacies of each incident, the interplay of cause and effect that has brought us to this moment. We ask ourselves the fundamental questions: Why did this happen? How did we respond? What can we learn from this encounter?
But reflection alone is not enough. To truly advance upon the path of Self-Craft, we must turn our gaze inward, embarking on a journey of self-discovery that will illuminate the hidden recesses of our soul. We must ask ourselves the difficult questions, the ones that force us to confront the very essence of our being. Why did we experience this incident in the way that we did? What deep-seated beliefs or desires motivated our response? If given the chance, would we choose to respond differently, to embrace a new perspective or way of being?
Through this process of self-reflection, we begin to cultivate a profound sense of self-knowledge, a deep understanding of the complex tapestry of our own psyche. As the ancient Wayist saying goes, "They who know themselves, graduate from the Path."
For it is only through self-knowledge that we can begin to effect true change, to reshape ourselves in the image of our highest aspirations.
Armed with this newfound understanding, we embark on the sacred work of Self-Craft, the art of sculpting a new self from the raw material of our own being. We engage in the process of metanoia, a profound rewiring of our soul minds and brain-mind, a transformation that requires us to confront and chisel away the aspects of ourselves that no longer serve our highest good.
This work is not for the faint of heart, for we are both the marble and the sculptor, the raw material and the artisan who shapes it. We must be willing to endure the pain of self-transformation, to face the discomfort of shedding old patterns and beliefs in order to emerge anew. But through this process of Self-Craft, we open ourselves to the possibility of profound growth and evolution, a metamorphosis of the soul that is possible only within the sacred space of the Butterfly Path.
For the Wayist, there is no such thing as a fixed character or personality, no immutable essence that defines us for all eternity. Rather, we recognize that we are the architects of our own being, the sculptors who hold the chisel and the hammer, the ones who shape the contours of our own soul. With each choice we make, each belief we embrace or discard, we are engaged in the sacred work of Self-Craft, the art of becoming the best version of ourselves.
And so, as we walk the winding path of existence, let us embrace the journey of Self-Craft with courage and determination, knowing that each experience, each moment of reflection and self-discovery, is a precious opportunity for growth and transformation. Let us be willing to confront the shadows within, to chisel away the aspects of ourselves that no longer serve, and to emerge, radiant and renewed, as the architects of our own spiritual evolution. For it is only through this sacred work that we can hope to graduate from the Butterfly Path, to spread our wings and soar into the boundless expanse of our own divine potential.
### Self-craft
In the whirling dance of human life,\
From womb to tomb, through joy and strife,\
\
The Wayist sees a tapestry grand,\
Of lessons woven by divine hand.
Each moment, each experience dear,\
A chance to grow, to conquer fear,\
\
To mold the self with conscious art,\
And sculpt the essence of the heart.
It starts with mindfulness, a gaze,\
Turned inward, to the inner maze.\
\
To ponder why, and how, and when,\
The threads of life were woven then.
To ask, "Why did I feel this way?\
What drove my actions, day by day?\
\
Is there another path, a choice\
That sings with wisdom's clearer voice?"
And as we dive into the deep,\
Of self-reflection's stormy keep,\
\
We come to know the truth within,\
The patterns that we must begin
To shift, to change, to rearrange,\
If we would be the change we crave.\
\
For as the sages wisely say,\
"Know thyself, and find theWAY."
With knowledge comes the power to grow,\
To let the divine within us flow.\
\
To wake up to the truth sublime,\
That we are sparks of the divine.
And then, the work of self-craft starts,\
A chiseling of our very hearts.\
\
We are the marble and the hand\
That shapes the soul, by love's command.
It's not an easy task, this art,\
To carve away the broken parts,\
\
The habits, fears, and wounds ingrained,\
The ego's grasp, so long maintained.
But with each strike of wisdom's blade,\
A truer self is slowly made.\
\
A self that shines with love and grace,\
A mirror of theWAY's embrace.
For in this school of Butterfly,\
Where souls can learn to spread and fly,\
\
There is no fate that can't be changed,\
No essence that can't be rearranged.
We are the artists of our souls,\
The sculptors of our highest goals.\
\
And with each lifetime, each rebirth,\
We mold ourselves to greater worth.
So let us take up chisel bold,\
And shape the self to beauty's mold.\
\
With mindful heart and wisdom's light,\
We'll craft a soul that shines so bright.
A masterpiece of love and grace,\
Reflecting theWAY's glorious face.\
\
For in the end, when we are free,\
We'll see that self was our great plea.
A call to grow, to evolve, to be\
The highest truth, eternally
## Adding Jewels to your Wisdom crown
A reminisce of what we have learned thus far.

With Joy, Awe, Mudita, and Attitude's aim.
To grow, to serve, to love with all our might,\
As Tara guides, us to the Lotus light.
Till in Sukhavati's bliss, we find our home,\
And with Father-Mother God, forever roam.
## The Metaphysics of Salvation
You're an old soul and very wise in comparison to others in the galaxy. You're not a defenseless child. You're attending an elite institution of the highest spiritual education in the galaxy. As an ancient and exceptionally capable soul, you have qualified for this prestigious program that few are privileged to access. Trillions of souls look up to you with awe and envy, knowing you are on the cusp of attaining an exalted state of being - an immortal spiritual entity, a radiant deity.
In this divine school for advanced souls, known as the Butterfly Path, your task is beautifully simple: show up and immerse yourself fully in the work of spiritual evolution and self-realization. All the mystical energetic processes and metaphysical mechanisms are masterfully handled for you behind the scenes.
Best of all, you need not walk this path alone. Your own Divine Tara, a luminous guide and tutor, is always by your side to support you on this transformative journey of the heart and spirit. With diligence and devotion, an unimaginable destiny awaits.
In the intricate tapestry of spiritual growth, there is a fundamental truth that often eludes the seeker: the only salvation we require is from the machinations of our own soul minds and the malleable nature of the brain-mind that resides within our mortal form. This realization, while daunting at first, is the very essence of the journey we undertake on the Butterfly Path, the sacred school where we learn to master the skills necessary to navigate the labyrinth of our own being.
As we walk this path, we come to understand that the work of spiritual transformation is not something that can be outsourced or delegated to a higher power. It is a deeply personal endeavor, a process of self-discovery and self-mastery that requires us to confront the shadows within and emerge, transformed, into the light of our own divine nature.
Yet, even as we undertake this solitary journey, we are not alone. Behind the scenes, a host of spiritual beings labor tirelessly to ensure that the Butterfly Path remains a sanctuary of learning and growth. Their presence, though often unseen, is woven into the very fabric of our experience, a silent testament to the love and wisdom that undergirds the universe.
When People of theWAY stated, in the 1st century, that Lord Jesus saved the world by his ministry, we said it was because of re-awakening the awareness of theWAY and Butterfly Path.
He taught the requirement of evolving the soul through *metanoia* (to reprogram your minds), and the requirement to being born again as a spiritual being, an immortal spiritual being. And he taught that his Father in heaven is not the same as the Father or God of the religions\--and for that, the religious people had him executed on charges of blasphemy, as they do.
The Lord renewed the teaching that had become obscured over time (as it always does), and in that way, again, saved all people in the world. The Lord did not intend for a religion to start up, and sell tickets to heaven in his name, but the Lord knew that soul-people will do so, and that it will go awry, as it always does. That is just how soul-people must be and will be, until they mature in spirit. We too were there.
The Lord did teach that no saviour will come to save us, because there is nothing to be saved from, except samsara, which is nothing out of the ordinary for souls and soul-people.
We must simply make use of all that the campus offer, and do the work of sanctification of self.
### That, has always been the teaching of theWAY.
Consider, for a moment, the small book that rests in your hands. Its presence is a miracle in itself, a manifestation of the countless unseen forces that conspire to get the teaching out, in your language, into your hands, to guide you on your path.
Just as the caterpillar, in its single-minded pursuit of sustenance, remains oblivious to the intricate web of life that surrounds it, which makes its life possible. So too, do we often overlook the magic and wonder that permeate our spiritual evolution, and soul existence, and unfortunately, we also lose the sensibility to be aware of what all it takes and how many billions of organisms work together to keep a human body in existence.
But as we progress along the Butterfly Path, as we begin to shed the chrysalis of our limited understanding, we come to see the world through new eyes. We begin to perceive the delicate threads that bind all things together, the cosmic dance of cause and effect that shapes our lives and our destinies.
And yet, even as we awaken to this greater reality, we must never lose sight of the fundamental truth that lies at the heart of our journey: no deity, no matter how benevolent or powerful, can save us from the consequences of our actions or bestow upon us the wisdom we seek. Our karma, the sum total of our thoughts, words, and deeds, is ours alone to bear, and our dharma, the path of righteousness that leads to liberation, is ours alone to earn, form, and walk.
This is the great challenge and the great opportunity of the Butterfly Path. We come here not to be saved, but to learn how to save ourselves from samsara, to unravel the knots of our own ignorance and emerge, radiant and free, into the light of our own indwelling divine potential. It is a journey that requires courage, persistence, and an unwavering commitment to the truth that resides within us.
So let us embrace the path before us, knowing that every step we take is a step towards greater understanding, towards a deeper appreciation of the mystery and wonder that surrounds us. Let us trust in the wisdom of the spiritual beings who guide us from behind the veil, even as we recognize that the ultimate responsibility for our growth and transformation lies within ourselves.
And let us never forget the ultimate goal of our journey: to emerge from the chrysalis of our limited understanding and take flight, as radiant butterflies, into the boundless expanse of our own divine nature. For it is only in embracing the truth of who we are, in all our flawed and perfect humanity, that we can hope to transcend the illusions that bind us and awaken to the ultimate reality that is our birthright.
## The Metaphysics of Prayer
## Prayer is essential - it changes not the deity, but yourself
In the grand tapestry of spiritual practice and divine communion, prayer is a thread of vital importance, a means by which we attune ourselves to the divine energies that suffuse not only the universe but, in particular, that of our own Heaven. The Heaven to where we are destined.
Prayer is not a mere supplication, a plea for divine intervention, but rather a profound act of self-transformation, a way of aligning our own energies with the great cosmic dance that surrounds us.
To walk the path of prayer is to embrace a discipline that is both formal and spontaneous, a practice that weaves itself into the very fabric of our lives. In the quiet moments of contemplation, we bow our heads and offer up our hearts to the Divine Tara, the celestial guardian who accompanies us on our journey. We speak to this Lord, this deity who meets us in the very core of our being, pouring out our hopes, our fears, our deepest longings.
But prayer is not a one-way conversation, a monologue delivered into the void. It is a dialogue, a sacred exchange between the mortal and the divine. As we offer up our words, we must also learn to listen, to attune ourselves to the whispers of inspiration that echo in the depths of our souls. In the days that follow our prayers, we must remain vigilant, searching within ourselves for the answers and guidance that we seek.
And yet, we must approach this practice with a heart that is pure and a mind that is open. For if we seek to impose our own answers, to manipulate the deities we call upon, we do so at our own peril. The Divine Tara, in all her wisdom and compassion, sees through the veils of our self-deception, and will not be swayed by the machinations of our ego. If we approach prayer with a spirit of disingenuousness, we may indeed go forth with our own version of divine help, but it will be a hollow victory, a pale imitation of the true guidance that awaits those who seek with sincerity and humility.
At times, the value of prayer lies simply in the presence of a compassionate listener, a being who understands the depths of our struggles and the heights of our aspirations. In the act of pouring out our hearts, we find solace and comfort, a sense of connection to something greater than ourselves.
But prayer is also a catalyst for self-discovery, a means by which we come to know ourselves more fully. As we strive to articulate the complex workings of our soul minds, to give voice to the tangled web of thoughts and emotions that dwell within us, we gain a clarity of insight that is both illuminating and transformative. Through the very act of organizing our thoughts and feelings into coherent expressions, we begin to unravel the knots of our own psyche, to see ourselves with a new level of understanding and compassion.
This self-knowledge, born of the crucible of prayer, is the foundation upon which all spiritual growth is built. As we come to know ourselves more fully, we gain the power to shape our own destiny, to craft our souls in the image of our highest aspirations. We become the architects of our own evolution, guided by the wisdom and insight that prayer unveils within us.
Finally, prayer serves as a conduit for divine energy, a means by which we attune ourselves to the great cosmic forces that permeate the universe and our heaven.
As we open ourselves to this flow of sacred power, we find that our spirit and soul minds are cleansed and invigorated, freed from the toxic energies that may have accumulated within us. In this way, prayer becomes an act of energy maintenance, a form of spiritual hygiene that keeps us aligned with the great rhythms of the cosmos.
So let us approach the practice of prayer with reverence and dedication, knowing that each whispered word, each silent plea, is a step upon the path of our own transformation. Let us speak to the holy spirit, our Divine Tara, with open hearts and minds, and listen for the answers that echo in the stillness of our souls. For in the sacred dialogue of prayer, we find not only comfort and guidance, but the very key to our own awakening, the doorway to a life lived in harmony with the great cosmic dance that surrounds us all.
## Rules for Self
In the tapestry of life, where threads of diverse experiences intertwine, the Wayist path illuminates the essence of our shared humanity. At the core of this wisdom lies a set of guiding principles, a compass for the soul, known as the Rules for Self. Wayism does not prescribe any "moral code" or set of ethics.
These so-called "rules for self" are more like the survival kit you pack for the exciting, most definitely joyous, but potentially awkward and hazardous excursion on the garden planet, a human life.
Avail yourself of these medicines and nutritions, lest the leeches bleed you dry and joy lead you astray, and come home with your dignity intact.
Self-respect, the bedrock upon which all growth is built, is the first and most vital rule. It is the recognition of our inherent worth, the divine spark that resides within each of us, our spiritual potential, our future station as deities. When we cultivate self-respect, we honor the sacred temple of our being, and our becoming, treating ourselves with the same reverence and care we extend to the most cherished of friends.
From the fertile soil of self-respect, the tree of self-control takes root. Through the nurturing of a positive attitude and the discipline of our thoughts and actions, we shape the contours of our lives. We become the authors of our own stories, choosing the words and deeds that will define our existence.
Self-love, the tender embrace of our own heart, is the rule that allows us to blossom into the fullness of our potential. It is the act of caring for ourselves, not just in the physical sense, but in the nourishment of our minds and the expansion of our spirits. When we love ourselves deeply and authentically, we create a well of compassion from which we can draw to heal the world. Without self-love, we cannot love others completely.
People who are themselves in crisis (and without self-love you are in crisis) have little room for empathy and sympathy, or love for others. People with self-love but little empathy or love for others are not Wayists.
It is crucial to understand that the spiritual concept of self-love, as embodied in the Wayist path, is fundamentally different from the selfish, self-obsessed, and narcissistic love that often masquerades as self-care in modern society. That form of self-love is prevalent among soul-people. We are talking about a higher self-love, that of spirit-people. Let's explain.
True self-love, as understood through the lens of spirituality, is rooted in the recognition of our inherent worth as ancient soul beings on a path of growth and self-realization, a path of evolving into immortal deities. It is a love that nurtures our highest potential, encouraging us to cultivate the qualities of humility, simplicity, and helpful-lovingkindness, and service to others. This form of self-love is not a shallow preoccupation with one's own desires or a self-centered pursuit of pleasure, but rather a deep appreciation for the sacred nature of our nature, our path, and our future existence and a commitment to living in alignment with our spiritual purpose.
In contrast, selfish and narcissistic love is characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a constant need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. Those who are consumed by this distorted form of self-love are soul-people and often prioritize their own needs and desires above all else, manipulating and exploiting others to feed their fragile egos. This kind of self-obsession is a far cry from the authentic self-love of spirit-people, advocated by the Wayist path, which recognizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the importance of cultivating humbleness, simplicity, compassion and understanding.
The Wayist perspective on self-love is grounded in the understanding that we cannot truly love others unless we first learn to love ourselves. However, this self-love is not an end in itself, but rather a foundation from which we can extend kindness and empathy to soul beings around us. When we embrace the spiritual concept of self-love, we become more attuned to the needs of others, more capable of offering genuine helpful lovingness, and be more effective in our efforts to create positive change in the world.
Spirituality, the thread that binds us to the infinite, is the rule that imbues our lives with purpose and meaning. It is the recognition that we are part of a vast, interconnected web, a cosmic dance in which every step, every breath, holds significance. Through the cultivation of spiritual skills, learning energy management, connecting with the divine, we learn to navigate the mysteries of existence, to find our place in the grand tapestry of life.
Joy and awe, the twin flames of the soul, are the rules that remind us to marvel at the beauty that surrounds us. In the laughter of a child, the graceful arc of a bird in flight, the delicate unfurling of a flower's petals, the love we feel for our life partner, watching the ocean's ballet, the symphony of the tiny frogs among the reeds, the myriad beings forming communities in the underbrush, the thrill of pagan abandon at a party, the taste of a nature-grown mango, the silence of the night, we find the essence of the divine. When we open our hearts to joy and awe, we become conduits for the light, spreading warmth and wonder wherever we go.
Energy-hygiene and ecology, the mindful cultivation of our inner and outer landscapes, are the principles that keep us anchored in balance and harmony. With heightened awareness, we learn to discern the subtle energetic exchanges that occur in our daily lives, gravitating towards experiences, nourishment, individuals, and environments that uplift and inspire our spirits. Simultaneously, we develop the wisdom and compassion to gently release and detach from those influences that deplete our vitality and dim our inner light.
By consciously choosing not to engage in negative thought patterns, toxic behavior cycles, and disempowering mindsets, we become steadfast guardians of our own energy, protecting the sacred space within us. In doing so, we not only preserve our own well-being but also become luminous beacons of hope and resilience for those around us, inspiring others to embark on their own journeys of energy mastery.
The practice of energy hygiene is a continuous, daily endeavor woven into the fabric of our lives. However, we also dedicate a sacred portion of our time, one-tenth, to the intentional maintenance and restoration of our multidimensional being - nurturing our body-minds, soul-minds, and spirit-minds. This ancient principle of tithing, of giving a portion of ourselves to the Divine, is not a mere religious obligation, but a profound spiritual investment. As we devote this time to self-care and inner growth, we open ourselves to receive the boundless blessings of the universe, aligning with the ever-flowing current of abundance and grace.
The care of our organic vessel, the body that houses our spirit, is a rule that honors the sacredness of our physical form. Through hygiene and respectful appearance, we demonstrate our gratitude for the gift of life, and our commitment to showing up fully in the world.
Finally, the rule of investing good energy in the community at large reminds us that we are not islands, but interconnected threads in the vast tapestry of humanity. When we extend our light to others, when we offer our gifts and our presence with an open heart, we contribute to the healing of the world.
These Rules for Self, like a compass pointing true north, guide us on the path of Wayist wisdom. They remind us that we are not merely individuals, but part of a greater whole, each of us a unique and essential note in the grand symphony of existence. As we walk this path, step by step, breath by breath, we come to understand that the love and respect we cultivate within ourselves ripples out to touch the lives of all we encounter.
In the end, the Rules for Self are not just a set of guidelines, but an invitation to dance with life, to embrace the fullness of our humanity, and to recognize the divine in every moment. As we honor these principles, we become co-creators of a world steeped in compassion, joy, and the profound understanding that we are all, at our core, in different grades in this school of divinity, and all other souls along, are interconnected threads in the beautiful tapestry of existence.

## Guardians and Teachers Raising Children
## You accepted the karmic task to prepare a human soul for the Path
In the intricate weaving of a tapestry for this life, we go where generations are woven together by the threads of wisdom and love; the role of parents and teachers shines like a guiding star. For it is through their nurturing touch and illuminating presence that the seeds of inquisitiveness, wisdom, compassion, and resilience are planted in the hearts of children, and they are dutifully prepared with skills to launch upon the world.
At the core of this sacred relationship lies the principle of respect, a mutual understanding that every soul, regardless of age or stature, carries within it a divine spark, and that all beings will receive from us, respect. In the Wayist tradition, respect is not merely a virtue to be admired from afar, but a living, breathing practice that permeates every interaction between adult and child. It is a recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of each individual, a commitment to honoring the unique gifts and challenges that each brings to the world.
As parents and teachers, we are called to be more than mere instructors; we are the stewards of the future, entrusted with the task of transferring the skills and values that will shape the contours of the world to come. Looking at the world now, you are witnessing the culturally conditioned thinking, societal engineering, brought about by the work of parents and teachers of the past.
Children need to learn from you the skills of courage, the strength to stand tall in the face of real life adversity; authenticity, the unwavering commitment to one's truth; respect for the divine, the self, and all living beings; responsibility and accountability, the twin pillars of personal growth; inquisitiveness, the spark that ignites the flames of learning and awe; critical thinking, the art of navigating the complexities of the mind; personal and community care, the recognition that we are all threads in the same tapestry --- these are the gifts we must bestow upon the children in our care.
But the transfer of these skills and values is not a matter of mere words or lectures. It is through the power of example that the deepest lessons are learned. Children, in their wide-eyed wonder and innate curiosity, are wired to absorb the world around them, to mirror the actions and attitudes of those they trust and admire. Long before they understand the intricacies of language or the abstractions of philosophy, they are watching, learning, and internalizing the unspoken lessons you live.
In every gesture, every word, every choice we make, we are teaching. When we meet challenges with courage and grace, when we extend compassion to those who are struggling, when we take responsibility for our mistakes and strive to make amends, we are painting a vivid picture of what it means to walk the path of wisdom and love. And when we honor the divine in ourselves and others, when we approach the world with a sense of awe and reverence, we are planting the seeds of soul development and spirituality that will bloom throughout their lives.
As Wayists, we recognize that the journey of childhood is a sacred unfolding, a metamorphosis from the caterpillar of self-discovery to the butterfly of self-actualization. Our role as parents and teachers is to create a sacred space of love and safety, a space where children can explore, question, and grow without fear of judgment or rejection, a space we call home. We must nurture their passions, celebrate their triumphs, and comfort them in their struggles, always remembering that our ultimate goal is not to mold them in our image, but to empower them to become the fullest expression of their own unique truth.
In this great dance of teaching and learning, we are all students of theWAY, forever seeking to refine our own understanding and to deepen our capacity for love and wisdom. As we walk this path alongside the children in our care, let us remember that we are not merely shaping individual lives, but contributing to the healing and transformation of the world. For the seeds we plant in the hearts of the young will one day blossom into the gardens of the future, a world where compassion, courage, and connection reign supreme.
So let us approach this sacred task with humility, reverence, and an open heart, knowing that in every moment, we have the opportunity to be a beacon of light and love for the generations to come. May we teach by example, and in doing so, help to weave a tapestry of wisdom and compassion that will endure long after we are gone, a living testament to the power of the Wayist path.
## PARENTS & TEACHERS PREPARE CHILDREN FOR LIFE

## Couples and Partners
## These are Core Skills for Wholesome Partnerships
 In the sacred dances, the waltzes and salsas of life, where souls come together to create a harmony greater than the sum of their parts, the Wayist path illuminates the essence of wholesome partnership.
It is a bond that transcends the fleeting nature of romantic love, a connection forged in the fires of shared values, mutual respect, and the unwavering commitment to each other's growth and fulfillment.
Wayism precedes the recent western standard of mandatory monogamy and honors many forms of partnerships that proved beneficial in the past, building large clans of self-sufficient groups not in need of government handouts and prescribes.
You are people who came together to hold hands as you walk your souls Home in the purpose of life.
At the heart of your union lies the understanding that a partnership is not a hierarchy, but a dynamic interplay of energies, a balance of yin and yang. Just as the celestial realms are governed by the harmonious collaboration of divine forces yin and yang, and our Heaven, a Father God, and Mother God. So too, must an earthly household be a sanctuary where partners contribute their unique strengths, wisdom, and resources.
There is no room for dominance, overbearingness, or subservience in this sacred dance, only the recognition that each soul is an essential thread in the tapestry of their shared life. That yin has her duties and strengths, and yang has his duties and strengths---each needs the yin or yang support of the other to balance things out. If the one insists on being the dominant energy, or one reneges on their contribution when the other's energy is required, the mismanagement of energies breaks the bonds.
The foundation of a Wayist partnership is built upon the bedrock of mutual respect, a deep reverence for the divine spark that resides within each individual, and respect for the family unit. This respect extends beyond the confines of the home, permeating every interaction with the wider world. Partners become each other's champions, fiercely protecting the honor and dignity of their beloveds, even in the face of societal pressures or the temptations of gossip. In this sacred bond, there is no room for disrespect for it is betrayal, for to dishonor one's partner is to fracture the very essence of the union itself.
Loyalty and devotion to the family unit are the threads that weave the partners together, creating a tapestry of love and support that can weather any storm. Through the practice of mudita, the art of finding joy in each other's happiness and successes, couples cultivate a resilience that allows them to face life's challenges with grace and compassion. They become each other's safe haven, a sanctuary where authenticity and vulnerability can blossom without fear of judgment or rejection. They provide passion, and space for the other to be fulfilled of needs for self-wholesomeness.
If the Yin feels she understands perfectly the Yang, and vice versa, that's not right for these extremes harbor incomprehensibles the one from the other. But each sense the move of the other before it comes, and harmony ensues. To observers it's so graceful, seems effortless, so beautiful. But only they who dance know the work they put in to make such beauty, a divine work, for sure.
Chrestotes, the highest form of love that transcends the ephemeral nature of passion, is the guiding light of a Wayist partnership. It is the art of being helpful and kind, not merely in grand gestures, but in the small, daily acts of tenderness and support. Through this practice of mutual lovingkindness, couples create a trusted space where both partners can thrive, nurtured by the warmth of each other's care and consideration.
Sensuousness, the language of touch, erotic, and play, of physical connection, is a vital thread in the tapestry which can easily become a plush carpet for love making, in a wholesome partnership. It is the recognition that the human body is a sacred vessel of multiple energies, a conduit for expressions of kindness, being, love, comfort, and desire. Partners honor and celebrate the sensuous nature of their bond, understanding that physical intimacy is not merely a biological imperative, but a profound way to connect with each other's essence, not as an adjunct but an imperative ever-present.
Joy, the elixir of the soul, is the lifeblood of a thriving partnership. Couples who walk the Wayist path understand that true happiness is not a fleeting emotion, but a state of being that arises from a deep connection to each other and to the divine. They actively cultivate joy in their lives, seeking out moments of beauty, wonder, and laughter, and sharing these precious gifts with each other.
At the core of a Wayist partnership lies a shared commitment to spirituality, the recognition that their union is not merely a worldly arrangement, but a sacred journey of growth and self-discovery. Together, they walk the path of the butterfly, supporting each other as they navigate the challenges and triumphs of transformation. They understand that their commitment to one another is a reflection of the divine love that permeates the universe, and that their partnership is a vehicle for expressing that love in the world.
Authenticity, the courage to be one's true self, is the cornerstone of a wholesome partnership. In the safe haven of their union, partners reveal their true selves, deepest hopes, fears, and dreams, and biological realities of authenticity. They understand that being authentic is being true, a testament to the depth of their trust and connection.
Finally, the practice of udbhu-kanti, the art of finding contentment and beauty in the simple joys of life, in what is authentic, simple, humble and lasting, is the secret to a partnership that endures. Couples who embrace this wisdom understand that true happiness is not found in the pursuit of material wealth or external validation, but in the quiet moments of connection, the shared laughter, the trust, and the simple pleasures of a life lived in harmony with each other and with the world. Their home is their inviolable safe space, a shield against the onslaughts of the world, a holy space where disruptive energies are not allowed.
A partnership built upon these sacred principles is a fortress of the soul, a sanctuary where love can flourish in the face of any adversity. Whether they walk through the valleys of sorrow or bask in the sunlight of joy, Wayist partners know that they are never alone, for they carry each other's hearts with them always. Theirs is a bond that transcends the boundaries of time and space, a love that is woven into the very fabric of the universe itself.
In the end, a wholesome partnership is not merely a contract between individuals, but a sacred covenant with the divine energies and metaphysical laws to walk the Path together. Together we are stronger, together we make greater things possible than what individuals can do by themselves.
It is a promise to honor the best in each other, to endeavor to introspect and self-craft for advance and change, to support each other's growth and evolution, and to be a beacon of love and light in a world that often feels shrouded in darkness.
It is a promise to light up one another's life, create joy and awe, and face the dystopian world out there together, with a smile. By walking this path together, Wayist partners become co-creators of a life that is rich in meaning, purpose, and joy, a living testament to the transformative power of love in all its forms.
## The Ethics of Partnership Unions
In the rich tapestry and very intricate energy layers of human relationships, the concept of marriage takes on a profound significance within the Wayist philosophy, transcending the narrow confines of romantic love and sexual fidelity to encompass a deeper, more expansive vision of partnership. For the Wayist, marriage is not merely a social construct or a legal contract, but rather a sacred union of souls, a coming together of two individuals who seek to create a dynamic and harmonious unit that nurtures the growth and well-being of all involved.
And before these starts to sound like mere platitudes from the dollar store, let's explain. If the partners are not in accord on the Purpose of Life, the meaning of life, and the path to fulfil that very reason for being here as a human, the marriage may not last, and if it does, it will be to the detriment of some.
At the heart of the Wayist understanding of marriage lies the principle of cooperation, a recognition that true partnership is founded upon the willingness of each individual to work together for the greater good of the union. In this vision, the assets and liabilities, the joys and sorrows, the triumphs and challenges of life are not borne alone, but rather shared equally, with each partner taking on the responsibilities and rewards of the partnership as a whole.
Central to this understanding is the recognition that a truly successful partnership must embrace and balance the energies of both yin and yang, the complementary forces that together create the fabric of the universe. Just as the governance of Heaven requires the presence of both energies to maintain harmony and balance, so too must the management of a household be guided by the wisdom of both masculine and feminine principles. In decision-making, both perspectives must be considered and honored, ensuring that the choices made reflect the needs and aspirations of the partnership as a whole.
But a partnership between people of the same energies has a different challenge by degree. If it is between best friends of the same energy, the dance looks different, and beautiful, too.
The Wayist view of marriage also acknowledges the transient nature of romantic love, recognizing that the initial passion and infatuation that often brings two people together is but a fleeting spark in the greater journey of a shared life. While sexual fidelity is certainly valued and respected, it is not held up as the sole or defining measure of a successful partnership.
While sexual exclusiveness is a popular norm, it certainly is not the only path, especially if that element is wanting in the partnership that works well, but for that.
The Wayist understanding recognizes that there are many forms of love and intimacy that can sustain and enrich a relationship, from the deep bonds of friendship and companionship to the selfless devotion of parental care, and so much more.
Wayism does not prescribe nor proscribe. No-one but the partnership themselves are the sole authorities on how they practice improvising steps for their uniquely masterful dance.
That being said, the Wayist philosophy does acknowledge that certain actions, such as bringing home another's child to be raised by one's partner without agreement, can represent a fundamental breach of trust and commitment, one that may well signal the end of a partnership for some. But even in such moments of crisis and upheaval, the Wayist approach is one of compassion and understanding, seeking to find the path forward that honors the needs and well-being of all involved.
Beyond the traditional model of monogamy, the Wayist understanding of relationships embraces the diversity of human experience, recognizing that there are many different structures and arrangements that can create the conditions for a fulfilling and nurturing partnership. From the polyamorous traditions of certain indigenous cultures to the communal living arrangements of intentional communities, the Wayist philosophy accommodates the many ways in which humans can come together in love and support.
What unites all of these diverse expressions of partnership, however, is a shared commitment to the fundamental ethics and principles that underlie the Wayist worldview. At the heart of any successful relationship, whether it be between two individuals or an entire community, lies a deep respect for the inherent dignity and worth of all beings, a recognition of the interconnectedness of all life, and a dedication to the cultivation of wisdom, compassion, and mindfulness in all aspects of one's being.
Ultimately, the Wayist vision of marriage and partnership is one that seeks to create a sacred space in which the highest aspirations of the human spirit can be nurtured and realized. It is a vision that recognizes the profound transformative power of love, not merely as a feeling or an emotion, but as a way of being in the world, a commitment to the growth and flourishing of all beings. And it is a vision that invites us to embrace the full spectrum of human relationships, from the most intimate bonds of the heart to the vast web of interconnection that unites us all in the great dance of life.
This Marriage vow was used in a wedding I officiated. It is lovely, but it cost the groom on the bar tab because it was a bit long to hear it twice. The couple, now retired, live this vow to this day.
"In the presence of our beloved community, our cherished families, and the boundless love that permeates the very fabric of the universe, I stand before you today, my heart overflowing with joy and gratitude, to make this sacred vow of partnership and commitment.
\Partner's name\, as we embark on this journey of shared life and love, I pledge to you my unwavering devotion, my respect, my constant support, and my eternal friendship. I vow to be your companion and your ally, to walk beside you in times of joy and sorrow, to celebrate your triumphs and to comfort you in your struggles.
I promise to honor and respect the unique and precious being that you are, to cherish your dreams and aspirations as if they were my own, and to create a sacred space in which your highest self can flourish and grow. I will strive always to see the divine spark that shines within you, and to reflect back to you the beauty and strength of your own soul.
As we build a life together, I pledge to bring the full measure of my own being to our partnership, to share with you my hopes and fears, my laughter and tears, my wisdom and my folly. I will work each day to cultivate the qualities of chrestotes, compassion, mindfulness, and equanimity that are the foundation of a loving and enduring relationship.
In our decision-making and our daily lives, I promise to honor the balance of yin and yang, to seek the wisdom of both masculine and feminine principles, and to create a household that is a sanctuary of harmony, growth, and love. I will strive to be a responsible and caring steward of the resources and blessings that we share, and to use them always in service of our highest values and aspirations.
Though I know that the path ahead may be marked by challenges and change, I make this vow with a heart that is open and fearless, secure in the knowledge that our love is a force that can transform and uplift not only our own lives, but the lives of all those we touch. I pledge to face the adventures and adversities of life with a spirit of curiosity, courage, and compassion, and to never lose sight of the profound gift of our connection.
\Partner's name\, in the presence of all those gathered here today, and in the sight of the infinite love that is the source of all being, I give you my hand, my heart, and my sacred vow. May our partnership be a beacon of love and light in this world, and may we walk the path of wisdom and compassion together, now and always.
This I vow to you, with all that I am and all that I shall become, from this day forward and for all the days of our shared journey. May our love be a blessing to ourselves, to each other, and to all beings, now and forevermore. So let it be."
## How does one become a Wayist?
The short answer:
> You mature into it. Like all of us, ever, you awaken to it. Your soul worked on it for many lifetimes. She earned it, to become a cognitive Wayist. Often, it is an awakening to what the soul knew all along, but body-mind and culture clouded it---\'till now. It is a milestone in spiritual maturity. If you loved what is in this book, or recognize it as your ancient truth, you are a Wayist.
In the grand tapestry of human spiritual evolution, the path to becoming a Wayist is not a singular, prescribed journey, but rather a natural unfolding of divine wisdom and what your spiritual guide decides for you. It is a natural unfolding of wisdom that has echoed through the hearts and minds of seekers across all ages and cultures. From the dawn of humanity, individuals have found themselves drawn to the ineffable truths that lie at the core of Wayist philosophy, growing into this understanding through a myriad of channels and experiences.
The wisdoms that have been shared above are not the exclusive domain of any one tradition or lineage, but rather the universal insights that have blossomed in the souls of every true mystic throughout history. There is, in essence, only one Path, a singular thread of divine revelation that weaves its way through the diverse fabric of human spirituality. No matter the external trappings of religion or dogma, all those who sincerely seek the truth will eventually mature into the same fundamental realization, a knowing that transcends all labels and definitions.
For some, the journey to Wayist understanding may begin within the confines of a traditional soul-religion, a path that seems at first to be separate from the essence of Wayist thought. And yet, as the great mystics of all traditions have attested, there comes a moment of awakening, a point at which the seeker must transcend the limitations of dogma and doctrine, and embrace the deeper truth that lies beyond. From Kabir to Rumi, from Ibn Arabi to Janabai, from St. John of the Cross to Lallaswari, to countless others, the same spiritual insights and experiences have been described, a testament to the universal nature of the Wayist path.
This is the essence of the Butterfly Path, a journey of transformation that may take many forms and follow many routes, but which ultimately leads to the same destination. Some may find their way through the slow unfolding of life\'s experiences, gradually awakening to the truths that lie within. Others may be drawn directly to the People of theWAY, finding in this community a reflection of the wisdom that already resonates within their souls. But regardless of the path taken, all will eventually arrive at the same place, a realm of spiritual understanding where the very same truths bloom and guide us home.
You may awaken while embedded in a religio-cultural context you cannot shed for whatever reason. It might be Islam, Judaism, Christian, Buddhist, whatever; like millions who have gone before, you become a Buddhist-Wayist, Christian-Wayist, or privately a Wayist. We can join any religious ceremony and make the space our own, turn the words to feed our soul, distance ourselves from the bad energies and teachings---no problem.
For those who find themselves resonating with the Wayist philosophy, the question of commitment is not one of external declaration or formal initiation. Rather, it is a matter of inner recognition, a knowing that arises from the depths of one\'s being. The terms \"woman of theWAY\" and \"man of theWAY\" have been used for millennia, not as labels of membership, but as expressions of a fundamental orientation, a way of being in the world that is grounded in the principles of Wayist thought. Few languages use the -ism and -ist suffixes, as in Wayism, Wayist for example. We have forever been known, and still are known as People of theWAY in most countries.
If you find yourself drawn to the Wayist path, but are not yet ready to make a formal commitment to your spiritual growth, there is no need for concern. The journey of Wayist understanding is one that unfolds naturally, a process of gradual integration in which the truths of this philosophy become the very fabric of your reality. Begin to live this new worldview, allowing it to inform your thoughts, your actions, and your interactions with the world around you.
For those who feel called to deepen their engagement with the Wayist path, there are many opportunities to connect with like-minded seekers and to accelerate their spiritual growth. Joining an online community of Wayists can provide a rich source of support, inspiration, and guidance, offering access to self-advancement courses, mystical poetry and music, meditations and songs, commemoration days, and a wealth of other resources.
Some may feel drawn to become teachers, sharing the wisdom of Wayist thought with others. Others may contribute their talents in posting extracts from books and adding their experience to social media, or writing, translation, making music, or community management, organizing workshops for teachers to speak, each finding their own unique way to support the growth and flourishing of the Wayist community.
Ultimately, the path of Wayist understanding is one of personal transformation, a journey of self-discovery and self-realization that unfolds in perfect alignment with the unique contours of each individual soul. Whether you choose to engage deeply with the Wayist community or simply allow these truths to guide you in the quiet of your own heart, know that you are part of a timeless lineage of seekers, a tapestry of souls woven together by the threads of divine wisdom. As you walk this path, trust in the unfolding of your own journey, and know that with each step, you are drawing ever closer to the ultimate destination, the realization of your own innate divinity and the profound interconnectedness of all things.
If your soul and spirit move you to take a decisive step to truly becoming a cognitive Person of the Way, please find us, announce yourself, and contribute your loving self.
## More Jewels in your Wisdom Crown
A shy glance, looking back to what we learned in section two.
### The path of Wisdom, steady, and true. Never easy, but its the all of you.
In the realm of souls, no savior's hand\
Can pluck you from the karmic land\
Of your own making, your own design,\
For 'tis your work, your path to climb.
The Butterfly School, where you now tread,\
Will guide your steps, but you must shed\
The chains of mind, both soul and brain,\
And learn to self-create, your freedom gain.
Behind the scenes, a myriad unseen\
Of spirits toil, to keep the dream\
Of growth alive, the forest's magic\
Weaving tales of wonder, never tragic.
The caterpillar, blind to their art,\
Yet benefits, as they play their part.\
No deity can grant you dharma's grace,\
For that's a treasure you alone must trace.
And prayer, that sacred dance of heart,\
A way to change your inner chart,\
\
To tune your soul to Tara's song,\
And commune with the divine, all along.
Pour out your joys, your fears, your pain,\
Then listen deep, for wisdom's refrain.
In days to come, the answers rise,\
From stillness, where the Spirit lies.
But if you impose your own reply,\
And try to sway the divine, awry,
You'll wander on, with your own light,\
A dim reflection of the Infinite's might.
To walk the Wayist path, a call\
That echoes through the ages, to us all.
Each mystic, sage, and seeker true,\
Has found this wisdom, ever new.
The names may change, the forms may shift,\
But Truth remains, a constant gift.
If in your heart, you know the Way,\
Then live it, breathe it, every day.
No rite of passage, no formal creed,\
Just love in thought and word and deed.
If you would grow, and swift progress,\
Then join the virtual address\
\
Of souls who share this sacred quest,\
And give your gifts, your very best.
Teach or write, translate or sing,\
Create or manage, support and bring
Your light to others, and in turn,\
Receive the blessings that you earn.
For in this world of maya's play,\
Where illusions dance and sorrows sway,
The Path of Wisdom, steady, sure,\
Invites us all to be more pure.
To own our minds, our hearts, our fate,\
And grow into our true estate.
As sons and daughters of the Light,\
Embracing all, with loving sight.
So walk on, Wayist, brave and true,\
The universe awaits your hue.
Your unique shade, your special tone,\
That adds to theWAY's resplendent zone.
For in the end. We are Holy Family. We are one.\
Reflecting Source. Like star, moon, and sun.
And as we dance this cosmic dance,\
We'll find our Way, our true romance.
## Closing
As we come to the end of this exploration of a number of teachings that are unique to theWAY, we find ourselves standing at the threshold of a new beginning. Your soul has most probably been a Wayist, or heard its teaching in the past and you know it because all so many things resonate with a sense of familiarity. That voice inside which says, "Yea, I knew that" is the old soul coming out, so happy to see you bringing the Light to brain-mind.
The wisdom contained within these pages is not meant to be a mere intellectual exercise, but rather a living invitation to re-embark the journey of profound spiritual transformation.
The path of Wayism is a path of awakening, a journey of the soul that calls us to shed the layers of illusion and conditioning that have obscured our true nature. It is a path that challenges us to own our minds, to cultivate authenticity, and to align ourselves with the eternal flow of theWAY.
But this path is not one that can be walked alone. It is a journey that is meant to be shared, a sacred dance of mutual support and inspiration. By joining the Wayist community, whether in person or online, we open ourselves to a rich tapestry of wisdom, compassion, and encouragement. We find fellow travelers who can light theWAY when the path grows dark and celebrate with us when we emerge into the radiant dawn of new insight.
The journey of Wayism is not always easy, for growth and transformation rarely are. But it is a journey that is infused with joy, wonder, and the unshakable knowing that we are all part of something infinitely greater than ourselves. With each step we take, each challenge we embrace, we are weaving our own unique thread into the great tapestry of existence.
So let us walk this path with courage, with authenticity, and with an open heart. Let us honor the wisdom of those who have come before us and blaze a trail for those who will follow. And let us always remember that the ultimate destination of this journey is not some distant heaven, but the radiant realization of our own divinity, right here, right now, in the sacred dance of this very life.
May the beauty, sensuousness, joy, awe, and living a full and meaningful life which comes from dancing life as a Person of theWAY, be the lamp unto your feet, and may your journey be blessed interesting, full of challenges, grace, the peace we all hold so dear, wisdom, and the abiding joy of awakening and flowing with divine Light.
May you walk with your Divine Guide.
