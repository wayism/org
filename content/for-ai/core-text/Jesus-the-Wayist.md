## Editorial Reviews
"In 'Jesus the Wayist,' du Plessis maps the fascinating journey of how humanity lost - and can rediscover - Lord Jesus's actual teaching. Rather than adding another layer of religious interpretation, this work strips away centuries of accumulated doctrine to reveal something both simpler and more profound: a practical path of spiritual evolution that transforms how we understand both Lord Jesus and our own divine potential."
~
"'Jesus the Wayist' accomplishes something remarkable - it reveals how a profound teaching about human spiritual evolution became transformed into a religion of belief and divine punishment. This complex and often challenging story is told with both unflinching honesty and the kind of wisdom and compassion that characterizes authentic spiritual understanding. The author maintains the delicate balance between historical truth-telling and the higher perspective necessary for genuine spiritual development. This isn't just another book about religion - it's an invitation to rediscover what Lord Jesus actually taught about human divine potential."
~
"This groundbreaking work does more than separate historical fact from religious fiction - it resurrects a lost understanding of human spiritual development. 'Jesus the Wayist' reveals how a universal teaching about conscious evolution became a regional religion about sin and salvation. Most importantly, it shows how this original wisdom remains vitally relevant for anyone seeking deeper spiritual truth today."
~
"'Jesus the Wayist' tackles one of history's most consequential transformations: how a revolutionary teaching about human spiritual evolution became a religion of belief and divine punishment. The author navigates this complex territory with remarkable clarity, never losing sight of the practical wisdom that Lord Jesus actually taught. This isn't an attack on religion but an invitation to discover something more authentic - a direct path to divine consciousness that transcends religious boundaries."
## Contents
## PART 1
### INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT
Two thousand years ago, a divine being incarnated in Galilee as the man Jesus to reawaken humanity to an ancient teaching called theWAY. This wasn't a religion, but a practical path of spiritual evolution teaching humans their true purpose - attending this school of divinity for soul beings, to develop from soul-beings into immortal spiritual beings. Lord Jesus taught this wisdom from Egypt to India, showing people how to connect directly with divine reality through energy healing and conscious transformation.
Fifteen years after Lord Jesus left Galilee, a Jewish religious scholar named Paul encountered the People of theWAY. Recognizing potential for religious reform, he borrowed some elements of their teaching, combined them with Jewish scripture, and created a new movement called Christianity. Three centuries later, Roman Emperor Constantine saw political advantage in Paul's creation. The God who demanded absolute obedience and promised to annihilate opposition perfectly suited imperial needs. He transformed this Jewish-Wayist hybrid into the Roman Catholic Church, commissioned the Christian Bible, and made it the state religion.
Today, while Christianity continues spreading the religion it created about Lord Jesus, Wayists preserve and share what he actually taught - not belief in a wrathful God, but practical wisdom for becoming the divine beings we're meant to be.
CHAPTER 1
## Beyond Religion
### What Lord Jesus really taught
Ever feel like something's missing in religious teaching? Like there's a deeper truth behind all the doctrine and rules? You're not alone. Millions of people sense there's something more authentic, more transformative than what religion offers. They're right - and the truth is far more revolutionary than most imagine.
Think about the Christianity you know - the focus on sin and salvation from the wrath of their angry God, the emphasis on correct belief and multiple interpretations, the rules about who's in and who's out. Now picture something completely different: A tough, sun-weathered man walking the ancient trade routes from Egypt to India, sleeping under stars, teaching people to heal with energy, showing them how to connect directly with divine wisdom. This isn't the pale, ethereal figure from stained glass windows - this is the real Lord Jesus, and what he actually taught might surprise you.
This teaching wasn't about starting a new religion. When Lord Jesus sent hundreds of trained healers throughout Asia, they weren't tasked with converting anyone. Their mission was beautifully simple: serve people through energy healing and share the basic message that every soul can evolve into a divine being. No special status required - just readiness to grow. This is why you'll find traces of his energy healing practices preserved in traditions across Asia.
Here's the revolutionary truth: Every human soul is evolving into a divine being. Not through religious belief or moral perfection, but through practical spiritual development and direct divine connection. Earth isn't a testing ground for heaven - it's a school for becoming divine. This isn't metaphor or poetic language - it's a practical reality that transforms everything about how we understand human purpose.
How is it that a philosophy, a method, a path, teaching gets adapted and appropriated for other uses? The Lord warned against this because it is a common phenomenon that happens and happened before.
Lord Jesus told them a parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.
The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'
'An enemy did this,' he replied.
The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'
'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"
For two thousand years, the full scope of Lord Jesus' teaching has remained largely hidden behind the religious structure that became Judeo-Christianity. This wasn't an accident - it was the deliberate result of turning a universal teaching about spiritual evolution into a religion of appeasing a god, belief, and salvation. Think about it: How did a profound teaching about human transformation become a system of beliefs you must accept to avoid eternal punishment? How did a message about spiritual awakening become a doctrine about original sin and need for salvation somewhat paid with by blood? The transformation of Lord Jesus' practical wisdom into Christian doctrine is perhaps the greatest bait-and-switch in human history.
But here's what most people don't know: The original teaching didn't disappear. While Christianity spread west, creating an empire-friendly religion of obedience and belief, Lord Jesus' actual teaching flourished eastward. From Kashmir to China, his practical wisdom about spiritual evolution merged naturally with existing traditions, enriching both. This is why you'll find echoes of his teaching in Buddhism, traces in Taoism, and clear footprints across Asia.
Understanding this transforms everything - not just your view of Lord Jesus, but your understanding of who you are and what you're here to do. You're not a sinful creature needing salvation, but a developing divine being in perfect training. Every experience, every challenge, every joy and sorrow serves your evolution. This isn't about believing the right things to earn divine favor. It's about developing the consciousness and capabilities that are your natural inheritance.
When you grasp this, daily life becomes your spiritual practice ground. That difficult colleague? They're helping you develop divine patience. That challenging situation? It's perfectly designed for your growth. That moment of unexpected joy? It's a glimpse of your natural divine state. Everything serves your evolution when you understand its true purpose.
Building on that opening, let me continue to expand on why this matters so urgently now:
This matters more than ever. Look around. Traditional religious frameworks are crumbling, for good reason. People are walking away from churches in unprecedented numbers - not because they reject spirituality, but because they seek something more authentic. They're looking for teachings that align with their inner sense of truth and their experience of divine reality.
The Lord Jesus you think you know bears little resemblance to the revolutionary teacher who:
- Trained hundreds of energy healers
- Taught practical spiritual evolution
- Demonstrated what humans can become
- Showed a universal path open to all
Think of it this way: If you're training to become a divine being who'll work with cosmic energies, wouldn't it make sense to start developing those abilities now? That's exactly what Lord Jesus was doing - running the most sophisticated professional training program in history. He wasn't performing mystical miracles - he was demonstrating and teaching abilities we're all meant to develop.
### **In the pages ahead, you'll discover:**
- Why Lord Jesus spent most of his life teaching in Egypt, Parthia, and India
- How his message of spiritual evolution became a Jewish religion of belief and salvation
- What he actually taught about divine nature, human purpose, and spiritual practice
- Why energy healing was central to his teaching
- How these teachings remain profoundly relevant today
Fair warning: Some of what you'll read here might challenge everything you thought you knew about Lord Jesus and his message. Good. Truth should challenge us. As Lord Jesus himself said, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."
Consider how this plays out in modern life. When someone faces a crisis, religious authorities typically offer:
- Prayers for divine intervention
- Promises of heavenly reward
- Warnings about sin and punishment
- Rules for proper behavior
But Lord Jesus taught something radically different:
- Direct connection with divine guidance
- Practical energy healing techniques
- Natural spiritual evolution
- Universal wisdom accessible to all
These teachings aren't about what you *should believe* - they're about what you *can become*. They don't require faith in religious doctrine but invite you to experience spiritual reality directly.
**Most importantly, they explain why you're here and what you're evolving toward.**
Ready to discover what Lord Jesus really taught? Let's begin by understanding the world he actually lived in - a world far richer and more complex than most people imagine. It's a world where spiritual seekers traveled vast distances exchanging wisdom, where ancient mystery schools preserved profound teachings, and where the boundaries between cultures were far more fluid than our history books suggest. This was Lord Jesus' world - and understanding it is the first step to grasping the revolutionary nature of his actual teaching.
But here's what makes this even more remarkable: Lord Jesus wasn't alone in discovering and teaching this truth. Throughout history, others have broken through religious boundaries to find exactly what he demonstrated. Their voices, often silenced by religious authorities, confirm something profound about his original teaching...
CHAPTER 2
## The Living Voice of Mystics
### Direct experience across time
Think about this: In every age, in every culture, individuals have broken through religious boundaries to experience exactly what Lord Jesus taught - direct divine connection beyond doctrine and ritual. We call them mystics, but they're really just people who discovered what Lord Jesus demonstrated - that the teaching of The Way which he taught is the foundation of all authentic spirituality, with authentic spiritual experience which transcends religious frameworks.
When Rabia, a Wayist mystic living as unmarried woman in a rising Islamization of her country in the 8th century, declares "Burn me in Hell if I worship You for fear of Hell," she's expressing the same truth Lord Jesus taught - that divine connection isn't about religious reward or punishment. She was reacting to the religion of Islam being forced on her, trying to scare her and others into submission. When Meister Eckhart, a Christian mystic who died an heretic, speaks of finding God beyond church doctrine, he's pointing to the same direct experience Lord Jesus demonstrated.
These voices matter because they show us something profound: The path Lord Jesus taught isn't unique to one time or tradition. Mystics across history have discovered the same reality, often at great personal cost. Many were persecuted by religious authorities, just as Lord Jesus was, for pointing beyond religious control to direct divine experience.
Consider what this means: When you feel drawn beyond religious frameworks to something more authentic, you're not alone. Throughout history, others have walked this path:
- Rabia breaking free from religious fear to find divine love
- Meister Eckhart defying church doctrine to speak of direct experience
- Kabir transcending Hindu-Muslim divisions to point to universal truth
- Rumi abandoning religious scholarship for direct divine connection
- Julian of Norwich finding wisdom beyond medieval Christianity
The chapter, "Mystic Poets" hosts a sampling of mystic poems. Our tradition is naturally replete with the works of mystics who had gone before. These aren't just historical figures - they're your spiritual ancestors. Their spiritual words, often forbidden or hidden by religious authorities, confirm what your heart already knows: Divine connection doesn't require religious permission or control.
Throughout this book, you'll hear their voices joining with Lord Jesus' original teaching. Not as religious authorities to be worshipped, but as fellow travelers who discovered the same truth you're discovering now - that authentic spiritual experience transcends all religious boundaries.
Their poetry and declarations aren't mere decoration. They're confirmation that what Lord Jesus taught is universally true, discovered again and again by those brave enough to look beyond religious constraints to direct divine reality.
It is worth noting that Lord Jesus' student and Wayist teacher Mari of Magadha's 1st century writings and poems survived the millennia, and Rabia's Wayist works written in the 8th century survived the ages, but Juliana of Norwich's work in the 14th century is the earliest work of a Christian woman on record. It took all of 1,300 years for Christianity to allow a woman's writings to get public attention.
Understanding that mystics in every age have discovered this truth helps us see Lord Jesus' world in a new light. He wasn't just a radical voice in ancient Galilee - he was teaching something that resonates so deeply with human spiritual experience that it keeps breaking through religious constraints, century after century.
To fully grasp this, let's look at the sophisticated world Lord Jesus actually lived in...
CHAPTER 3
## Jesus in His World
### Not what you might think
Think about the world Lord Jesus actually lived in - a vibrant crossroads where Greek philosophy met Indian mysticism, where Persian wisdom traded ideas with Egyptian mystery schools, where Chinese sages exchanged insights with Mediterranean merchants. This wasn't the isolated backwater that many imagine ancient Galilee to be. It was a sophisticated crucible of spiritual and philosophical exchange.
Born in cosmopolitan Galilee, Lord Jesus' family was from Nazareth, a suburb of the bustling trade city Sepphoris. Here, merchants and travelers from China, India, Parthia, and beyond brought not just silks and spices, but ideas that would shape human consciousness for millennia. As a baby, his parent had to flee because the Jewish King wanted to kill him.
They made it to the southern city of Bethlehem when the soldiers closed in on them. But, they were saved by influential easterners who helped them get to Egypt where Jesus grew up and studied and started working. Only to return to Sepphoris at age fourteen -- for a while. He left for the East soon after.
Imagine young Lord Jesus listening to tales of Buddhist monks who could heal with a touch, of Egyptian priests who understood the mysteries of death and rebirth, of Persian Zoroastrian magi who worked with subtle energies. This was his early classroom in how humans think and speak their philosophies - a world far richer and more complex than most people imagine.
Consider what it took to travel the Silk Road in those days. No GPS, no hotels, no established route maps. Yet Lord Jesus spent decades crossing some of the world's most challenging terrain - scorching deserts, treacherous mountain passes, territories controlled by bandits and warlords. He learned to speak multiple languages, navigate different cultures, and handle whatever challenges arose. This wasn't a sheltered holy man - this was someone who could:
- Debate philosophy with Greek scholars
- Discuss energy healing with Indian sages
- Share mystical insights with Egyptian priests
- Trade wisdom with Persian magi
- Read Sanskrit and study the Vedas, and debate scholars in India
- Connect with common people everywhere he went
One famous incident reveals his character perfectly. When Lord Jesus encountered the money changers in Jerusalem's Temple, he didn't just politely ask them to leave. He made a whip and physically drove them out, overturning tables and releasing animals from their cages. This wasn't the meek and mild figure of popular imagination - this was a man of decisive action who confronted exploitation directly and there wasn't a banker or a temple guard prepared to face up to this rugged powerful man.
But Lord Jesus was equally at home in intellectual circles. As a child he studied at the Library of Alexandria, one of the ancient world's greatest centers of learning. He could debate scripture and philosophy with rabbis, Buddhist monks, and Hindu scholars in their own languages. He moved comfortably between royal courts in Kashmir and peasant villages, adapting his teaching to reach each audience effectively.
He was an avatar (in human form) of an advanced spiritual being but fully human in all respects -- but with a perfected spirit in that body. What made him unique wasn't mystical power but practical wisdom. While religious leaders focused on rules and rituals, Lord Jesus taught something far more revolutionary - that every human soul can develop divine consciousness through direct experience. His message wasn't "worship me" but "do what I do." He demonstrated this by:
- Teaching energy healing to anyone ready to learn
- Showing how to access divine wisdom directly
- Breaking down barriers between humans and heaven
- Demonstrating what we can all become
- Showing religious scholars their circular reasoning and helping them reform
This wasn't just spiritual theory. When Lord Jesus trained healers, he didn't tell them to pray for divine intervention. He taught them practical techniques for working with energy, understanding consciousness, and facilitating transformation. These weren't miracles to prove his divinity but demonstrations of capabilities we're all meant to develop. All of his students eventually did the same "miracles" of healing that he did.
Think about what this means: The same person who could discuss advanced philosophy with scholars would sit with peasants teaching them to heal. The man who understood ancient mystical practices also knew how to make his message clear to unschooled fishermen. He wasn't creating a religion - he was showing humanity its divine potential.
Most importantly, Lord Jesus taught a universal path open to all souls, regardless of their cultural or religious background. This wasn't about converting people to a new faith - it was about helping souls evolve toward their divine potential. He demonstrated this by:
- Teaching energy healing to anyone ready to learn
- Sharing wisdom across cultural boundaries
- Respecting local traditions while revealing deeper truths
- Showing how spiritual evolution transcends religious divisions
When you understand this broader context, you begin to see why Lord Jesus' teaching was so different from the religious ideas of his time. He wasn't interested in creating another set of rules or starting a new religion. Instead, he taught about direct spiritual experience, energy healing, and the transformation of consciousness within Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Paganism (a modern name) and to the Gnostics and he revived Daoism in China which was the closest to the ancient Wayist roots. He showed people how to access divine wisdom within themselves rather than relying on religious authorities.
As your consciousness begins to transform, you'll discover something paradoxical - the more clearly you see, the more mysterious everything becomes. Farid ud-Din Attar, a Persian mystic who understood this profound truth, described it perfectly:
**"Mysticism** "
> The sun can only be seen by the light
> of the sun. The more a man or woman knows,
> the greater the bewilderment, the closer
> to the sun the more dazzled, until a point
> is reached where one no longer is.
> A mystic knows without knowledge, without
> intuition or information, without contemplation
> or description or revelation. Mystics
> are not themselves. They do not exist
> in selves. They move as they are moved,
> talk as words come, see with sight
> that enters their eyes. I met a woman
> once and asked her where love had led her.
> "Fool, there's no destination to arrive at.
> Loved one and lover and love are infinite."
*-Farid ud-Din Attar*
This isn't about confusion but about transcending our limited understanding. Just as Lord Jesus spoke of being 'born again of spirit,' Attar points to the transformation that happens when we move beyond mental knowledge into direct spiritual knowing.
This is why Lord Jesus sometimes frustrated religious leaders - he was showing a path that made their authority obsolete. His message wasn't about following rules but about transforming consciousness. Not about believing doctrines but about evolving spiritually. Not about joining a religion but about becoming divine.
Consider how radical this was in a world dominated by religious hierarchies. Lord Jesus was saying that:
- Every person could connect directly with divine reality
- Each soul could develop healing abilities
- Anyone could access spiritual wisdom
- Divine nature was everyone's inheritance
He demonstrated this by healing publicly, teaching openly, and challenging any system that placed barriers between humans and divine reality. The religious authorities didn't crucify him for teaching love and peace - they executed him because he threatened their entire power structure by showing people they didn't need religious intermediaries, they executed him because he believed in freedom of thought and speech.
But here's what's crucial to understand: Lord Jesus wasn't just another prophet bringing messages from God - he was a master teacher showing humanity how to evolve into its divine potential. He wasn't performing miracles to prove his divinity but demonstrating abilities we're all meant to develop. When he said "you will do greater things than these," he wasn't being poetic - he was describing our actual potential.
This understanding transforms everything about how we view Lord Jesus' life and teaching. Instead of seeing him as a unique divine figure to be worshipped, we can also recognize him as:
- A highly evolved teacher showing us our potential
- A master of spiritual technology sharing his knowledge
- A revolutionary breaking down barriers to divine connection
- A guide to our own spiritual evolution
In our next chapter, we'll explore how this universal teaching became divided into two very different paths - one focused on personal spiritual evolution, and another that became the religion we know as Christianity. But first, understand this: This isn't about claiming Lord Jesus exclusively for either path. It's about understanding the fullness of his teaching and its relevance for spiritual seekers today.
CHAPTER 4
## Two Paths Diverge
### How Wayist teaching was used to create Christianity
Imagine you're in Jerusalem around 30 CE. A remarkable teacher has been drawing crowds of thousands, healing the sick, teaching about spiritual evolution, and challenging religious authorities. His execution, meant to silence this movement, instead becomes a catalyst for something unexpected - the emergence of two very different interpretations of his message.
The original People of the Way, as they were known, continued practicing what Lord Jesus had taught: energy healing, direct spiritual experience, and conscious evolution along what we call the Butterfly Path. For them, Lord Jesus demonstrated what was possible for every human soul - the transformation from soul-being to divine being. His message wasn't about worshipping him, but about following the same path of transformation.
Then something fascinating happened that would change the course of Western civilization.
About ten years after Lord Jesus' death, a complex figure named Saul of Tarsus transformed the Judaic movement that he served in such deadly manner. As a zealous defender of traditional Judaism, he had actively persecuted the People of the Way, overseeing the execution of teachers like Stephen and imprisoning many others. The Way was a threat to traditional Judaism because it offered spiritual liberation without the need for temple authority or ritual sacrifice, and it taught of a spirit God our Father and God our Mother in heaven in contrast to the soul-like deity of the Jews.
But when The Way began attracting more followers despite persecution, Saul had a radical idea. Judaism itself was in crisis - Roman occupation and growing internal divisions were threatening its survival. Perhaps The Way could be transformed into a Jewish reform movement, with Lord Jesus cast as the long-awaited Jewish Messiah?
After claiming a vision of Lord Jesus, Saul (who renamed himself Paul) approached the Wayist elders with his proposal to create this hybrid teaching. The elders, practicing non-interference, assigned him a teacher named Barnabas to ensure he understood the basic teachings. What happened next would reshape Western civilization.
Paul took the Greek word 'christos' (from 'chrio' meaning "to anoint") as his translation for the Hebrew concept of messiah. He began developing a totally new religion - Christianity - that merged Jewish messianic expectations with elements of The Way. He attached the Hebrew Bible as its foundation and reframed Lord Jesus' teaching about spiritual evolution into a doctrine about blood sacrifice and salvation from their God's wrath through belief.
Let me continue developing how this profound division shaped spiritual history:
It's telling that the Jewish people of that time - and to this day - reject the idea of Lord Jesus as their messiah. They recognized that Paul's new religion, while claiming Jewish roots, was something entirely different from both traditional Judaism and Lord Jesus' original teaching.
This new interpretation spread rapidly through the Roman Empire. Why? Because it offered something incredibly attractive: the promise of salvation through faith alone, gaining the favor of a vicious and wrathful God, without the challenging work of personal transformation that The Way required. It gave people a simple story - believe in Lord Jesus as your savior, and you're saved.
This divergence became even more pronounced in 320 CE when Roman Emperor Constantine made Christianity the state religion. Suddenly, what had been a Jewish-Wayist hybrid became a powerful political tool. The emperor called together church leaders and instructed them to create an official set of scriptures - what we now know as the Christian Bible.
Think about this: Lord Jesus' actual words make up only about 7% of the New Testament, and many of these are repeated across different books. The rest is largely Jewish religious material and letters Paul wrote to his congregations. The focus shifted from spiritual evolution to a doctrine about Lord Jesus' death and resurrection as a sacrifice for sin.
This new religion served the empire's purposes perfectly:
- It gave rulers divine authority
- It provided control through the concept of sin and salvation and made money from sin taxes
- It established a hierarchy of priests who alone could dispense forgiveness
- It transformed Lord Jesus' revolutionary teaching into a tool for maintaining social order
- They divided the entire Roman Empire up into small "holy sees" and sold bishoprics to local business people who would in turn collect sin taxes and tithes, record births and deaths, and marriages, and send the balance of monies after commission to Rome.
- They expropriated and owned prime land in every downtown across the known world to build churches with the donations of the faithful -- the most valuable real estate portfolio in the world.
- They expropriated the ancient temples of 2,000 year-old religions and confiscated their assets and banned their teachings and burned their books.
Meanwhile, the original Wayist teachings continued spreading eastward. Many followers, seeking to escape persecution, traveled to Kashmir and other parts of Asia where they found more receptive communities and audiences. These teachings influenced and were influenced by Daoist, Buddhist and Hindu traditions, maintaining their focus on practical spiritual development rather than religious doctrine.
**The contrast couldn't be starker**
- Wayism kept Lord Jesus' emphasis on personal transformation, energy work, and direct spiritual experience
- Christianity developed a religious system focused on guilt, belief, sin, and salvation from the wrath of their God through faith. It was not their God or the Jews who were to blame for Jesus' tortuous death, it was the sinful nature of the believer that caused Jesus' suffering -- even for millennia afterward the faithful would still carry that guilt and pay the Church to beg their God to forgive them and not torture them for eternity.
Here's what's crucial to understand: Neither path is "wrong" - they simply serve different purposes and different stages of spiritual development. Christianity provides a structured religious system with a soul-type God that helps soul-people live moral lives and find meaning. Wayism offers a path of spiritual evolution with benign spiritual beings God our Father in Heaven and God our Mother in Heaven, for those ready to undertake the challenging work of personal transformation.
This understanding helps explain why you might feel something missing in traditional Christian teaching. It's not that Christianity is false - it's that it represents a different interpretation of Lord Jesus' message, shaped by specific historical and political circumstances.
In the chapters ahead, we'll explore what Lord Jesus actually taught about:
- The nature of divine reality
- The purpose of human existence
- The practice of spiritual evolution
- The development of divine abilities
Today, these two distinct paths continue to unfold. While Christianity developed into a global religion focused on salvation from the wrath of a very angry, murderous, and dangerous deity, the original spirituality of Wayism that Lord Jesus shared continues to transform lives through direct spiritual experience and conscious evolution. Neither path is 'wrong' - they simply serve different purposes and different stages of human spiritual development.
Understanding this history isn't about choosing sides. It's about recognizing that beneath the layers of religious doctrine lies something profound - a practical path of spiritual evolution that Lord Jesus actually taught. In the chapters ahead, we'll explore this original teaching not as religious theory, not a new religion because that is not what Lord Jesus taught, but as living wisdom that can transform your life today.
You might find yourself wondering: What did Lord Jesus really teach about divine reality? How did he understand human purpose? What practical methods did he share for spiritual development? These aren't just historical questions - their answers could revolutionize how you understand yourself, the purpose and meaning of your life, and your spiritual journey.
Let's discover together what happens when we strip away two thousand years of Judaic religious interpretation and Roman Catholic social engineering and encounter Lord Jesus' original teaching in all its revolutionary power.
CHAPTER 5
## The Three Wise Men
### More than a Christmas story
When Heaven decides to send a teacher to reinvigorate the ancient wisdom of The Way, it requires more than just a miraculous birth - it needs a sophisticated support network spanning continents. This is where the story of the "Three Wise Men" becomes far more fascinating than the simple Christmas tale most people know.
Forget the image of random astrologers following a star. These were influential spiritual leaders and rulers who had both the resources, spiritual connections with Heaven, and wisdom to recognize what was unfolding. One was King Gonophores of Parthia, whose dynasty ruled territories in what is now Iran, Pakistan and Kashmir. Another was a Daoist sage from the Tarim Basin, deeply respected among the peoples we now know as the Uyghur and Tajik. The third was a wealthy Zoroastrian trader whose network spanned modern Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.
Together, these three remarkable individuals didn't just bring symbolic gifts to a baby - they funded and facilitated a 35-year ministry that would transform spiritual understanding across Asia. Think about what this actually involved:
- Education in multiple ancient wisdom traditions
- Access to mystery schools and libraries
- Safe passage through dangerous territories
- Introductions to spiritual leaders across Asia
- Eventually, safe havens for Lord Jesus' followers fleeing persecution
Even their famous gifts hint at this deeper involvement:
- Gold: Not just treasure, but funding for a decades-long mission
- Frankincense and Myrrh: Rare medicines and energy healing substances normally unavailable in the West, crucial for the healing work that would become central to Lord Jesus' teaching
When Herod the king of Judea threatened the child's life, these "wise men" didn't just disappear from the story as the Christmas tale suggests. Their network arranged the family's escape to Egypt, where their connections opened doors to both the Temple of Isis and the Great Library of Alexandria. Here, the young Lord Jesus would study ancient wisdom that would later infuse his teaching.
This wasn't just about protecting a special child - it was about preparing a teacher who could bridge Eastern and Western spiritual understanding. Through their support, Lord Jesus gained access to:
- Egyptian mystery teachings about death and rebirth
- Greek philosophical traditions
- Persian energy work practices
- Indian spiritual technologies
- Chinese wisdom about natural law
Later, when Lord Jesus' followers needed to flee persecution in Judea, this same network helped establish refugee communities in Kashmir where a later Gonophores was king. These communities would preserve and transmit his original teaching while Christianity developed in the West. This is why you can still find traces of his authentic teaching woven through various Eastern traditions.
The three wise men's contribution to spiritual history goes far beyond the Christmas story. They exemplify how true wisdom transcends cultural and religious boundaries, recognizing truth wherever it appears. Their legacy lives on in:
- The international character of Wayist teaching
- The preservation of energy healing practices
- The integration of wisdom now reflected in multiple traditions
- The understanding that divine truth belongs to no single culture
In Wayist tradition, we honor these three not just for their gifts, but for their vision. They understood that what was unfolding wasn't about creating a new religion or establishing a new power structure. It was about reawakening humanity's understanding of The Way - a teaching so ancient and profound it required decades of preparation and support to transmit effectively.
As we'll see in the next chapter, this extensive preparation would prove crucial when the time came to share these teachings across Asia. The network established by the three wise men created the foundation for what would become one of history's most remarkable spiritual transmissions - even though most of the world has forgotten this part of the story.
CHAPTER 6
## Melchizedek
### The Way before religion
Long before Judaism existed, before the first stone of Jerusalem's temple was laid, a remarkable teacher walked the ancient world. Melchizedek, whose name means "King of Righteousness," teaches us something profound about spiritual truth: The Way existed before religions tried to claim it.
Think about this: Here was a spiritual teacher so advanced that Abraham - father of three major religions - recognized his authority and paid him tribute. Yet Melchizedek belonged to no religion. He traced his authority not to any human lineage or religious system, but to direct divine connection. He was, as ancient texts describe him, a "priest of the Most High God" - our Father in Heaven - without religious affiliation.
When Melchizedek met Abraham after a great victory, he performed a profound spiritual ritual - sharing bread and wine. This wasn't religious ceremony but spiritual technology, a practice Wayists still use today to remind ourselves that divine essence flows through all things. The bread represents the body of life itself, the wine the essence of being. Lord Jesus would later use this same practice, connecting himself to this ancient Wayist tradition.
Here's what makes this fascinating: The Jews themselves recognized that Melchizedek's spiritual authority transcended their religious system. They described him as "without father, without mother, without genealogy" - their way of saying his authority came directly from divine source, not through any religious lineage. This is crucial because it establishes a profound truth: Direct divine connection predates and transcends all religious systems.
When Lord Jesus was later described as "a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek," it wasn't creating a religious title - it was acknowledging that Lord Jesus, like Melchizedek, taught The Way that exists independent of religion. Both demonstrated:
- Direct divine connection without religious intermediaries
- Spiritual authority from divine source, not human institutions
- Universal wisdom that transcends cultural boundaries
- Transformation through spiritual practice rather than religious observance
This helps explain why Lord Jesus so often challenged Jewish religious authorities. He wasn't trying to reform their religion - he was, like Melchizedek before him, teaching a path that transcends religion entirely. This is why they executed him. He wasn't just questioning their interpretations; he was demonstrating that their entire religious system was unnecessary for divine connection.
### The Melchizedek tradition teaches us that
- Spiritual truth exists independent of religion
- Divine connection requires no religious authority
- Wisdom traditions predate religious systems
- The Way is universal, not culturally bound
- Direct spiritual experience trumps religious doctrine
This understanding liberates us from thinking we need religious systems to connect with divine reality. Just as Melchizedek demonstrated spiritual power without religious affiliation, we too can develop direct divine connection without religious intermediaries.
### Consider how this transforms our understanding
- We don't need religious permission to connect with heaven
- Divine wisdom isn't owned by any tradition
- Spiritual practice transcends religious boundaries
- Direct experience matters more than doctrine
- The Way existed before religion and will exist after it
This is perhaps why the memory of Melchizedek endures - he reminds us that The Way is older, deeper, and more universal than any religion. As we walk this path today, we're not following a religion but participating in an ancient tradition of direct divine connection that predates all religious systems.
Think about the implications for modern spiritual seekers. When religions claim exclusive access to divine truth, we can remember Melchizedek. When they demand adherence to their particular rules or doctrines, we can recall this ancient teacher who demonstrated divine connection without religious structure. When they insist their way is the only way, we can point to this evidence that The Way transcends all religious claims.
**This understanding transforms spiritual practice from religious obligation into direct divine communion.**
**It frees us to**
- Experience divine reality directly
- Develop spiritual wisdom naturally
- Practice transformation without religious constraints
- Connect with heaven through our own divine nature
Remember: When Lord Jesus challenged religious authorities who claimed exclusive divine access, he wasn't just speaking as another religious reformer. He was standing in the tradition of Melchizedek, showing that divine connection is our natural birthright, not the exclusive property of any religious system.
This is the profound truth that sets us free - not from sin and punishment as religion teaches, but from the very idea that we need religious systems to connect with divine reality. The Way has always been there, before religions tried to claim it, and will remain when their claims are forgotten.
CHAPTER 7
## The Universal Gift
### Heaven within reach of all
Picture a poor mother in a remote village. Her child is sick. She has no money for temple offerings, can't read sacred texts, and lives far from any religious authority. Yet through Lord Jesus' teaching, she knows something profound: She can connect directly with heaven. Her simple home shrine is as sacred as any temple. Her heartfelt prayer reaches divine ears as clearly as any priest's chant. Her Divine Tara hears and guides her just as surely as any religious expert.
This was Lord Jesus' revolutionary gift to humanity - not a new religion, but the shattering of religious barriers between humans and heaven. Before him:
- Only monks could meditate
- Only priests could pray effectively
- Only temples held sacred power
- Only the educated could access wisdom
### With his teaching
- Every home became a potential shrine
- Every heart could connect directly with heaven
- Every person could access divine wisdom
- Every soul could walk the path
This wasn't just spiritually revolutionary - it was politically explosive. Religious authorities maintained power by positioning themselves as necessary intermediaries between humans and the divine. Lord Jesus bypassed this entire power structure, placing divine connection directly in everyone's hands.
### Think about what this meant for ordinary people
- A farmer could commune with heaven while working his fields
- A mother could receive divine guidance while caring for her children
- A slave could experience spiritual freedom despite physical bondage
- Anyone could develop divine wisdom regardless of education or status
#### This is why you'll find
- Simple shrines in humble homes across Asia
- Direct divine connection in daily life
- Profound wisdom in illiterate elders
- Sacred practice without religious trappings
### The most enlightened Wayist might be
- An old grandmother who never read a book
- A farmer who never entered a temple
- A village woman who never saw a city
- A person who never heard of Wayism
### This is why Avalokiteshvara (Sanskrit tile of Lord Jesus in spiritual form) is celebrated across Asia as
- Guanyin in China
- Kannon in Japan
- KwanAm in Korea
- The hearer of all cries everywhere
**Billions recognize this gift of direct divine access. It extends far beyond Christianity's scope because it is**
- Not limited to believers
- Not controlled by institutions
- Not dependent on education
- Not restricted by culture
### Every person can
- Connect with divine guidance
- Access spiritual wisdom
- Walk the path directly
- Experience heaven within
This is perhaps Lord Jesus' greatest gift to humanity - not a new religion, but the breaking of religious chains that kept heaven distant from human hearts. He showed that divine connection isn't about:
- Religious authority
- Institutional power
- Educational achievement
- Social status
But about:
- Direct divine connection
- Personal spiritual experience
- Individual transformation
- Universal access to heaven
This understanding isn't just historically interesting - it's immediately liberating. You don't need:
- Religious permission to connect with heaven
- Institutional approval to walk the path
- Expert interpretation to understand wisdom
- Special status to experience divine reality
Heaven is within reach of all, just as Lord Jesus promised. The only question is: Will you accept this gift of direct divine connection?
CHAPTER 8
## Savior of Humanity's Spirit
### To save people from religion
When Lord Jesus said "I am the way, the truth, and the life," he wasn't claiming exclusive divine franchise - he was declaring liberation from religious control over spiritual development. Think about what he actually did: He shattered the temple's monopoly on divine access, exposed religious manipulation of souls, and demonstrated that direct divine connection is everyone's birthright.
Christians and Jews need salvation, which is basically protection, from their wrathful and vengeful God who will kill them. Lord Jesus understood that God to be a persona, created by men of old, a character like a powerful man with a temper and a tribalistic dream that his devotees will one day rule the world but because he cannot do it himself he needs devotees to fight his wars for him. And the men imposed that persona on the Creator of the universe. And with that scare tactic they intend to rule the world and subvert all non-believers. Lord Jesus knew that, it is obvious, so he tried to teach about the true purpose of life and the real Father in Heaven.
### Consider the revolutionary nature of his actions
- He taught energy healing to anyone ready to learn, breaking the priest's monopoly on divine power
- He showed divine connection without temple ritual, bypassing religious authority
- He demonstrated spiritual evolution without religious permission
- He taught direct divine access to women, outcasts, foreigners - everyone
- He exposed how religion often blocks rather than enables spiritual growth
This is true salvation - not saving souls from divine punishment, but liberating them from religious control over their spiritual development. When he said "You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free," he was talking about freedom from religious monopoly over divine connection.
Consider what happens when you break free from religious fear and reward systems. When a religion threatens you with hell fire, you don't see it because your God is a spiritual God who is by default, in essence, benign and will never harm a human. Rabia, who began life as a slave but became one of Wayism most profound spiritual teachers, expressed this liberation with stunning clarity:
> O God! If I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell,
> and if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise.
> But if I worship You for Your Own sake,
> grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty
*-- Rabia al Basri*
This isn't religious rebellion - it's spiritual revolution. Like Lord Jesus challenging temple authorities, Rabia understood that authentic divine connection transcends both religious threats and promises.
### Look at Lord Jesus' pattern
- Religious authorities claimed only they could interpret divine will - Lord Jesus taught everyone to connect directly
- Temples claimed exclusive rights to divine presence - Lord Jesus showed divine reality everywhere
- Priests claimed sole power to mediate divine blessing - Lord Jesus demonstrated anyone could develop spiritual gifts
- Religious laws claimed to control salvation - Lord Jesus showed divine evolution is natural birthright
This is why religious authorities saw him as such a threat. He wasn't just questioning their interpretations - he was dismantling their entire system of spiritual control. By showing that:
- Divine connection requires no religious permission
- Spiritual development needs no institutional approval
- Divine wisdom flows freely to all who are ready
- Every soul has direct access to spiritual evolution
**He truly saved humanity from religious bondage over spiritual development.**
This salvation continues today through:
- Direct divine guidance through Taras
- Natural spiritual evolution without religious control
- Free access to divine wisdom and energy
- Universal opportunity for soul development
When Lord Jesus said "I have come that they might have life more abundantly," he wasn't offering religious membership but liberation from religious control over spiritual life. He showed that:
- True spirituality transcends religion
- Divine connection is everyone's birthright
- Spiritual evolution needs no religious permission
- Every soul has direct access to divine reality
This is the salvation humanity really needs - not from divine wrath, but from religious control over divine connection. Lord Jesus provided this by:
- Breaking religious monopoly on divine access
- Exposing spiritual manipulation
- Demonstrating direct divine connection
- Teaching universal spiritual evolution
He is truly the world's savior - not through religious doctrine but through liberation from religious control over spiritual development.
The liberation goes even deeper. Consider three more profound freedoms Lord Jesus gave humanity:
### Freedom from Scripture's Authority
When Lord Jesus said "You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life," he was pointing out a fundamental error. He was not referring to the fact that the Hebrew Scriptures are not suitable reading for children, that it tells of a desperately angry, tribal God with murderous intent. No, Lord Jesus delivered in Galilee the same message he delivered among Buddhists, Hindus, Zoroastrians and Wayists western China. He demonstrated that:
- Living wisdom transcends written doctrine
- Direct experience matters more than ancient texts
- Divine truth flows freely, not through books
- Personal revelation supersedes scriptural authority
- Spiritual evolution doesn't require sacred texts
This is why he left no scripture of his own. Truth isn't found in holy books but in direct spiritual experience. This spiritual truth was advanced by Wayist teachers throughout history and Bodhidharma (6th century CE) was famous for speaking to the fact that Buddhism has 80,000 scriptures and people are still trying to find the essence of Buddhism in it.
### Freedom for Self-Healing
By teaching energy healing to hundreds, Lord Jesus put tremendous power back in human hands:
- We can sense and work with healing energies
- Many mental and emotional issues can be addressed through energy work
- Communities can develop their own healing resources
- Physical and spiritual health are often connected
- We don't need exclusive reliance on institutional healthcare
This isn't about rejecting medical care when needed, but about reclaiming our natural ability to work with healing energies.
### Freedom for Private Spirituality
Perhaps most revolutionary was Lord Jesus' teaching that "the kingdom of heaven is within you." This means:
- Your spiritual life is between you and your Divine Tara
- No one needs to know about your inner practice
- You can maintain deep spirituality in any environment
- External circumstances can't block internal growth
- True spiritual development happens in the heart
### This internal freedom means you can
- Live in any culture while maintaining your path
- Practice spiritual development without advertising it
- Connect with heaven regardless of external constraints
- Grow spiritually without public declaration
- Maintain your divine connection privately
Lord Jesus demonstrated this himself - maintaining profound spiritual connection while moving through different cultures and contexts. He showed that true spirituality needs no external validation or public expression.
This complete liberation - from religious control, scriptural authority, healing monopolies, and public spiritual performance - makes Lord Jesus the true savior of human spiritual development. He freed us not from divine punishment but from all human systems that claim exclusive rights to divine connection.
Remember: Your spiritual journey is your own. No institution, text, or authority can claim ownership of your divine connection. This is the real salvation Lord Jesus brought - complete freedom to evolve spiritually in direct relationship with divine reality.
CHAPTER 9
## Women of theWAY
### Liberation from religious patriarchy
Before Christianity transformed Lord Jesus' teaching into Jewish religious doctrine, something remarkable was happening: women were leading spiritual communities, healing, teaching wisdom, and experiencing divine connection without male permission or oversight. This wasn't accidental - it was fundamental to theWAY's nature.
Consider Mari of Magadha, often called Mary Magdalene in Western tradition. Far from the "reformed sinner" Christianity later portrayed, she was one of Lord Jesus' most advanced students and a powerful teacher in her own right. She traveled independently, taught spiritual wisdom, and led communities - unthinkable in the patriarchal religious structures of the time.
But she wasn't unique.
Historical records show that the early movement of theWAY was dominated by women.
Why? Because it offered something revolutionary:
- Direct divine connection without male permission
- Spiritual authority based on development, not gender
- Mystical experience without institutional control
- Teaching roles based on wisdom, not cultural status
- Freedom from patriarchal religious hierarchy
Then something dramatic happened. As Paul transformed his version of theWAY into a Jewish-style religion, we see the patriarchal clampdown begin. Suddenly:
- Women were told to stop their mystical dance practices
- They were ordered to tie and cover their hair during worship
- Their teaching roles were restricted
- Their spiritual authority was questioned
- Their mystical experiences were controlled
- Later the "gospel" that Mari wrote was edited and renamed 'the gospel according to John'.
**Look at Paul's letters, where he commands women to**
- Be silent in religious gatherings
- Submit to male authority
- Stop teaching men
- Cover their heads
- Restrict their spiritual expression
This wasn't just about social control - it was about suppressing the natural spiritual power women had displayed in theWAY. The very practices that had made theWAY liberating for women were systematically restricted under the new religious structure. This wasn't about "cultural notions of the time" because in Roman society women were free to worship at any of the many temples and nobody would tell them to dress up or cover up -- it was a Judaic notion to control and subject women.
The same happens in Buddhism where women are impure and cannot gain enlightenment, they must wait for a male birth. And many pagodas ban women outright, but all ban menstruating women. The religions are not compassionate.
### Why does this matter today? Because we see the same pattern
- Women tend to seek spiritual connection more readily
- They're often more open to mystical experience
- They frequently lead in spiritual development
- They naturally gravitate toward direct divine connection
- Yet religious structures still often restrict their roles
### theWAY offers as always what it originally provided
- Freedom from religious patriarchy
- Direct divine connection without permission
- Spiritual development without gender barriers
- Teaching based on wisdom, not gender
- Mystical experience without institutional control
### Think about it: In theWAY, there's no
- Religious hierarchy and does not to enforce gender roles
- Institutional authority to restrict teaching
- Doctrinal basis for male dominance
- Control over spiritual expression
- Limitation on divine connection
#### This is particularly relevant in today's world where
- Many women seek spiritual depth without religious control
- Men often focus on practical security concerns
- Religious institutions still struggle with gender equality
- People seek authentic spiritual connection
- Ancient wisdom meets modern liberation
The people of the God who vows to destroy us, who sees us as Amalekites of old and want to annihilate our society, they are attacking at the core of what holds society together. They social engineer the downfall of the father figure in the household, they start women's liberation movements to get women in the workplace and encourage divorce and animosity between male and female, so children grow up without the core household and role models, and people are poorer but buy more stuff, they own the pornographic websites and online prostitution websites and sex toy franchises, and music franchises that destroy morals and culture in their lyrics, and they spend billions on interfering with democratic institutions to get their social engineers elected, and get us to give them tax money to declare wars on others, and they install otherism and division wherever they can. This is not new and it is not surprising, their war manuals tell the story how it is done and the history of the times they have done it to other nations.
And the Wayist knows that this is just how soul-people run the world and it has always been, and will be so for as long as this school of divinity for souls exist. We don't take it personal, but we do keep ourselves safe from their influence.
Real spiritual transformation isn't about following religious rules or performing rituals. It's an organic process that consumes your entire being. Akka Mahadevi captures this perfectly in her metaphor of the silkworm:
## Like a silkworm weaving
Like a silkworm weaving
her house with love
from her marrow,
and dying
in her body's threads
winding tight, round
and round,
I burn
desiring what the heart desires.

Cut through, O lord,
my heart's greed,
and show me
your way out,

O lord white as jasmine.
This is what Lord Jesus meant by dying to be born again - not religious conversion, but complete transformation of your nature. Like the silkworm becoming a butterfly, you're meant to emerge as something entirely new.
theWAY remains what it always was - a path of direct spiritual connection that transcends gender-based religious restrictions. It recognizes what many religious institutions still resist: that spiritual development, divine connection, and teaching wisdom have nothing to do with gender and everything to do with individual development.
### This liberation isn't just historical - it's immediately practical.
### In theWAY
- Your spiritual practice is yours alone
- Your divine connection needs no permission
- Your development follows no gender rules
- Your teaching flows from wisdom, not status
- Your mystical experience is between you and heaven
CHAPTER 10
## The Living Power of Energy Work
### From Lord Jesus to Today
You already sense energy more than you realize. Ever walked into a room and immediately felt the 'atmosphere'? Known someone was looking at you without seeing them? Felt drained after being with certain people? Been energized by specific places or activities? That's not imagination or coincidence - it's your natural energy sensitivity at work.
When Lord Jesus spent most of his time teaching energy healing, he wasn't performing mystical miracles - he was demonstrating and teaching abilities we all naturally possess. Think about it: If you're training to become a divine being who'll work with cosmic energies, wouldn't it make sense to start developing those abilities now? That's exactly what Lord Jesus was doing - running the most sophisticated professional training program in history.
It is noteworthy how Roman Judeo-Christianity relegated Lord Jesus' core teaching and the skills of energy healing to the underground. Even removing malipsyches (demons in Christian language) became a specialty assigned to a handful priests who serve the entire world, where in Lord Jesus' time it was basic energy work that every Wayist learned.
Here's what most people miss: Everything is energy. Your thoughts, emotions, physical body, relationships, even your spiritual essence - all are different forms of energy interacting in intricate ways. Learning to work with energy isn't some mystical sideshow - it's like a medical student learning anatomy. It's fundamental to your future profession.
Start with something simple: Before your next meal, hold your hands over your food and sense its energy. This isn't magical thinking - it's developing basic professional sensitivity. Just as doctors learn to feel subtle differences in tissue that most people would miss, we're learning to sense energy variations that most people overlook.
Before you eat, hold your hands together and center yourself. Change your energy to gratitude for the beings you are about to assimilate and make part of yourself, and be atone with the cycle of energy ecology. It changes you, and the way your food is used in your body.
Your most powerful energy tool is something you use constantly but probably haven't recognized: attitude. Like adjusting a radio dial, your attitude instantly shifts your personal energy frequency. This isn't 'positive thinking' - it's practical energy management. Lord Jesus emphasized this repeatedly because it's a fundamental professional skill.
Consider how this plays out in daily life. When you walk into a room and immediately sense the 'atmosphere,' that's your natural energy sensitivity at work. When you feel drained after being with certain people, that's energy awareness trying to get your attention. These aren't coincidences or imagination - they're your innate professional capacities beginning to awaken.
### As you develop, you'll learn to
• Sense different types of energy clearly
• Clear negative energy accumulations effectively
• Channel healing energies skillfully
• Maintain healthy energy boundaries naturally
• Work with cosmic forces consciously
This isn't about becoming some kind of mystic. It's about developing the practical skills you'll use eternally as a divine being. Think of it like medical residency for cosmic healers - every experience, every practice session, builds your professional capacity.
Remember: You're not trying to gain supernatural powers. You're developing natural abilities that are already part of your divine heritage. Just as a baby bird already has everything needed for flight but must develop its wings, you have everything needed for energy work but must develop your abilities through practice.
**Your Divine Tara guides this development perfectly, like a master surgeon training a resident. They know exactly**
• What skills you need to develop
• When you're ready for new challenges
• How to help you progress safely
• Where you need more practice
Most importantly, understand that energy work isn't separate from daily life. Every interaction, every situation, every challenge becomes an opportunity for professional development. This is why Lord Jesus demonstrated healing everywhere he went - he was showing how natural and normal these abilities should be.
### The beauty is that as you develop these skills, you naturally become more
• Aware of subtle realities
• Effective in helping others
• Clear in your perceptions
• Skillful in your actions
• Professional in your service
This is what Lord Jesus meant when he said his followers would do greater things than he did. He wasn't setting himself up as an unreachable ideal but demonstrating abilities we're all meant to develop. Every energy practice, every healing attempt, every conscious interaction develops the abilities you'll use eternally as a divine being.
Remember: You're not seeking mystical powers - you're developing professional skills for eternal service. This is exactly what Lord Jesus taught and demonstrated. The question isn't whether you can develop these abilities - you already have them. The question is whether you're ready to develop them consciously and skillfully.
## PART 2
### FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES FROM CHRISTIANITY
CHAPTER 11
## Transforming the Image of God
### Jesus's greatest challenge
Imagine trying to teach advanced mathematics to people who believe two plus two equals twenty-two - not as a mistake, but as a sacred truth written in holy books and defended with violence. This was essentially Lord Jesus's challenge in Judea. While other great teachers like Buddha and Lao Tzu could build fresh philosophical frameworks on relatively neutral ground, Lord Jesus faced something far more daunting: helping people trapped in a rigid system of belief about a deity who demanded violence, celebrated genocide, and encouraged tribal exclusivity.
This wasn't just about correcting wrong ideas. The people he worked with had built their entire identity around these beliefs. Their sacred texts told stories of their god commanding the slaughter of entire peoples, including children. They celebrated these accounts as proof of divine favor. Their religious authorities wielded these texts to justify violence against outsiders and harsh judgment against their own people. To question these interpretations wasn't just theological disagreement - it was perceived as an attack on their very identity as a people.
Yet Lord Jesus didn't have the luxury of starting fresh. He couldn't simply tell them, "Your understanding of God is completely wrong - let's start over." Such an approach would have been instantly rejected, possibly violently. Instead, he had to find ways to transform their understanding from within, using their own texts and traditions but completely reframing their meaning. This was spiritual jiu-jitsu at its finest - using the momentum of existing beliefs to move people toward a radically different understanding.
Look at how he did this. When confronted with a crowd ready to stone a woman for adultery - an action their texts explicitly commanded - he didn't directly challenge the law's authority. Instead, he created a moment of self-reflection: "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone." In that pause, people had to confront the gap between their idealized self-image and reality. The stones dropped not because the law changed, but because people's understanding of its purpose transformed.
When religious authorities quoted scripture about keeping the Sabbath holy, Lord Jesus didn't argue against the text. Instead, he asked, "Which of you wouldn't pull your ox from a ditch on the Sabbath?" He took their own experience of compassion and used it to reveal a deeper truth about divine nature. The god who would let an animal suffer for the sake of a rule was not the true God - and they knew this in their hearts.
Most brilliantly, Lord Jesus introduced new metaphors for divine nature that completely contradicted the violent, vengeful deity of many traditional texts. His story of the prodigal son presents a father who runs - actually runs, something considered undignified for an elder - to embrace a wayward child. This image stood in stark contrast to the god who demanded the death of disobedient children, yet Lord Jesus presented it as the truer picture of divine nature.
This wasn't just clever teaching strategy. Lord Jesus was dealing with people who had scripture quoting their god saying things like "Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey." How do you help people who revere such texts to understand that God is actually universal love? How do you transform understanding that's rooted in centuries of celebrating divine violence?
Lord Jesus's answer was to consistently emphasize interior transformation over external compliance. "You have heard it said 'Do not murder,' but I tell you anyone who is angry with a brother or sister is subject to judgment." This moved the focus from outward behavior to inner spiritual development. It wasn't about following rules to avoid divine punishment - it was about growing into greater spiritual maturity.
When he said "my father is not your father, your father is a murderer..." to Judaic religious authorities, he was highlighting this fundamental difference in understanding. Their god was a tribal deity demanding violence and exclusivity. The true Divine he knew was universal love and wisdom, inviting all toward spiritual evolution. Yet rather than reject their scripture outright, he worked to help them reinterpret everything through this new lens of universal love.
This remains one of the most profound examples of spiritual teaching in human history. Rather than reject problematic texts or argue against them directly, Lord Jesus found ways to transform their interpretation from within. He showed how the same texts that had been used to justify violence and exclusion could be reread as lessons about love and universal human dignity.
For those who've left religion because of its violence and exclusivity, this aspect of Lord Jesus's teaching offers something powerful: You don't have to reject everything to find truth. Like Lord Jesus, you can learn to reframe and reinterpret, finding deeper meaning beyond literal readings. The challenge isn't to abandon the search for truth, but to look deeper, beyond surface interpretations that justify violence and separation.
CHAPTER 12
## The Tribal God and the Seeds of Division
Picture a young child being taught that their family's god wants to annihilate entire peoples who don't share their beliefs. That their god delights in smashing infants against rocks, commands the slaughter of men, women, children, and even animals of "enemy" peoples. That their god has chosen their tribe alone to rule over all others. Now imagine this child growing up and having to reconcile these violent divine "truths" with basic human empathy.
This isn't just ancient and recent history - it's happening today. Religious texts that celebrate divine genocide and tribal supremacy aren't just gathering dust on shelves. They're being actively taught as sacred truth, shaping how millions view both their god and their fellow humans. The results play out in headlines daily:
- Religious justification for military aggression
- Divine mandate claimed for territorial expansion
- Sacred duty invoked for cultural dominance
- Holy war declared against "infidels"
- Religious backing for racial supremacy
When your god hates the same people you're taught to fear, it creates a perfect circle of justified prejudice. After all, if the supreme creator of the universe despises certain groups, who are you to disagree? If your holy book commands their destruction, how can showing them mercy be right?
This isn't just about individual bias - it's about systemic dehumanization woven into the very fabric of belief. Consider how much easier it becomes to:
- Drop bombs on villages when you see the inhabitants as divinely condemned
- Deny basic rights to those your god has rejected
- Celebrate the suffering of "enemies" your deity despises
- Justify conquest of those your god wants eliminated
- Feel righteous about oppressing "lesser" peoples
Lord Jesus faced this exact dynamic. The religious authorities of his time maintained power through an ideology of divine favoritism and sacred hatred of outsiders. His response wasn't to create a kinder version of tribal religion, but to demonstrate something radically different - universal divine love that transcends all human divisions.
This is why they killed him. Not for teaching love and peace, but for threatening the very foundation of religious tribalism by showing that:
- Divine reality embraces all beings equally
- Spiritual truth transcends cultural boundaries
- Divine love knows no tribal limits
- True wisdom dissolves artificial divisions
- Sacred reality unites rather than divides
When Lord Jesus said his teaching would bring division within families, he wasn't promoting the kind of violent tribalism found in religious texts. He was acknowledging that awakening to universal truth naturally creates tension with those still trapped in tribal thinking. It's the gentle friction of growth, not the violent clash of conquest.
### Consider how this transforms human relationships
- Instead of asking "Who does my god hate?", we ask "How can I serve all beings?"
- Rather than learning who to exclude, we discover how to include
- Instead of justifying violence, we cultivate understanding
- Rather than defending tribal territory, we recognize our shared journey
- In place of divine favorites, we see divine potential in all
This isn't about creating a new religion to compete with old ones. It's about transcending the very idea of tribal gods and chosen peoples. When Lord Jesus taught "love your enemies," he wasn't suggesting warm feelings toward opponents. He was pointing to the profound truth that in divine reality, there are no enemies - only souls at different stages of evolution.
The Wayist understands that tribal religion serves a purpose in human development, like training wheels on a child's bicycle. But at some point, those training wheels become an obstacle to true balance. Similarly, tribal concepts of deity eventually hinder rather than help spiritual growth.
Remember: You're not just leaving behind a limited view of god - you're awakening to the limitless reality of divine love. This isn't about rejecting faith but about evolving beyond the need for tribal deities who hate what we fear and bless what we desire. That's the real freedom Lord Jesus demonstrated - liberation from divine tribalism into universal spiritual truth.
CHAPTER 13
## The Nature of Divine Beings
Here's a profound truth: Divine Parents, as spiritual beings, embody beneficence in their very essence - they are inherently kind, compassionate, humble, and wise. This isn't a matter of choice or personality, but rather their fundamental nature. Just as water naturally flows downward, divine beings are naturally good - it's simply what they are.
These beings would never wage war or call upon their devotees to harm others. If action must be taken against any opposing force, they handle it directly rather than expecting their children (us) to fight on their behalf. As superior beings with mastery over energy, they can simply adjust or transmute any threatening energies, rendering them harmless or transforming their current form. The concept of a "cosmic war" becomes meaningless, as no entity could pose a genuine threat to them.
For a metaphor, consider this: Divine beings' relationship to negative forces is like the sun's relationship to shadows. A shadow, no matter how dark or vast, can never truly "fight" or threaten the sun. The sun doesn't need to wage war against shadows or recruit others to help eliminate them - its mere presence naturally transforms darkness into light. The shadow doesn't need to be destroyed; it simply ceases to exist in its current form when light shines upon it.
This understanding transforms how we see our own spiritual journey. We're not learning to make better moral choices or trying to please a deity - we're evolving into beings whose very nature is divine. Think about the implications:
- A naturally humble being doesn't struggle with pride
- A naturally compassionate being doesn't have to remember to be kind
- A naturally wise being doesn't wrestle with foolish choices
- A naturally beneficent being can't cause harm
### This is radically different from the gods of religions, who can be
- Jealous and angry
- Demanding of worship
- Cruel to unbelievers
- Arbitrary in their favor
- Prone to human-like emotions
Real divine beings can't be any of these things because their nature won't allow it. That's why claims about angry or vengeful gods tell us more about human psychology than divine reality.
### This understanding illuminates what Lord Jesus meant when he taught about the Three Powers
- **Humility**
- **Simplicity**
- **Compassion** (with its highest expression in Chrestotes)
These aren't just virtues to cultivate or rules to follow. They're markers of spiritual evolution - signs that our nature is transforming. When these qualities become as natural to us as breathing, we're well on our way to becoming spiritual beings.
## Here's where energy work becomes crucial
### As soul-energy beings evolving toward spiritual consciousness, we need to
- Learn to perceive and work with subtle energies
- Transform lower energies into higher frequencies
- Align our energy with divine patterns
- Heal disturbed energies in ourselves and others
This is why Lord Jesus spent so much time teaching energy healing. It wasn't just about helping people feel better - it was practical training for our future role as spiritual beings who work with cosmic energies.
### Understanding this completely reframes our purpose
- We're not here to worship an unknowable creator
- We're not trying to earn salvation through belief
- We're not seeking to escape from existence
### Instead
- We're evolving from soul to spirit consciousness
- Learning to work with cosmic energies
- Developing natural divine qualities
- Preparing for eternal service as spiritual beings
Think about the implications. Every experience, every challenge, every joy becomes part of our transformation. We're not just learning lessons - we're literally evolving into a higher form of consciousness.
### When we graduate from the school of Earth, we'll join other spiritual beings in
- Helping souls in energy trouble
- Working with cosmic energies
- Serving as healers throughout the galaxy
- Guiding others on their journey
This is why Lord Jesus said his followers would do greater things than he did. He wasn't setting himself up as an unreachable ideal but showing what's possible for every soul who walks this path.
### Living with this understanding changes everything
- Every interaction becomes practice in divine qualities
- Each challenge is an opportunity for transformation
- All relationships are contexts for developing higher consciousness
- Every moment offers a chance to work with energy
### Most importantly, we understand that
- Divine nature is our destiny, not just our aspiration
- Spiritual evolution is natural, not supernatural
- The path is practical, while our relationship with the divine is mystical
- The goal is attainable, not just imaginable
This is the revolutionary understanding that Lord Jesus taught - not a religion of worship and belief, but a practical path of transformation into divine being. In the next chapter, we'll explore what this means for how we understand God, heaven, and human purpose.
CHAPTER 14
## The Missing Mother
### How religion lost half of heaven
Imagine discovering that half your family history had been deliberately erased. That's exactly what happened with our understanding of Heaven. Christianity didn't just hide Lord Jesus' original teaching - it completely erased our Mother in Heaven. How did we go from a complete divine family to a single male God? The answer reveals one of history's most profound spiritual cover-ups.
Archaeological evidence tells a fascinating story. Early Jewish worship, far from being monotheistically male, included both Yahweh and his divine consort Asherah. In homes and temples across ancient Israel, people honored both divine parents. They understood what we're rediscovering today - that divine reality, like nature itself, must include both masculine and feminine aspects to be complete.
The erasure happened in stages. First, during King Josiah's reign in Judah, a dramatic political power play unfolded. The worship of Asherah, particularly beloved by women, was seen as a threat to patriarchal control. With calculated precision, the divine feminine was officially banned from Jewish tradition. Imagine the impact - overnight, half of heaven was legally erased.
This artificially limited version of divinity then became the foundation for Christianity. Despite Lord Jesus clearly teaching about both our Father and Mother in Heaven, the church fathers, steeped in patriarchal Judaism, carefully constructed their male-only divine hierarchy.
Consider what this meant:
• Women lost their divine role model
• Feminine wisdom was suppressed
• Natural spiritual balance was distorted
• Divine nurturing was masculinized
• Half of divine nature was denied
But truth has a way of persisting. When Lord Jesus, known in Sanskrit as Avalokiteshvara, declared he would appear to seekers in whatever form most helped them - including female forms - he was restoring this crucial understanding. This is why today, across Asia, you'll find Guanyin revered as the "Mother of Mercy." In fact, more people pray to this feminine manifestation of divine compassion than to any other spiritual figure in history.
This isn't about modern gender equality or social justice. It's about something far more fundamental - the complete nature of divine reality. Just as our universe exists through the interplay of yin and yang energies, our Heaven operates through the perfect balance of Father and Mother. One without the other is like trying to breathe with one lung or walk with one leg.
Think about how this artificial limitation affects everything:
• Religious systems become unnaturally rigid and authoritarian
• Spiritual wisdom loses its intuitive, nurturing dimension
• Divine love is stripped of its maternal warmth
• Cosmic balance is artificially skewed toward masculine energy
• Human spiritual development is unnecessarily restricted
Lord Jesus' restoration of this truth wasn't just theological correction - it was spiritual liberation. By teaching about both Father and Mother in Heaven, he was showing us:
• Divine reality is naturally complete, not artificially limited
• Spiritual truth embraces all energies, not just masculine ones
• Heaven operates through perfect balance of both parents
• Divine wisdom flows through both masculine and feminine channels
• Every soul needs both divine models for full development
This understanding transforms everything about how we:
• Approach divine reality - seeking wholeness, not partiality
• Engage with spiritual growth - balancing all energies
• Understand cosmic order - seeing complete patterns
• Experience divine guidance - receiving both types of wisdom
• Practice spiritual development - developing all aspects
Today, as rigid patriarchal religious systems crumble, people are naturally rediscovering this ancient wisdom. Our Mother in Heaven wasn't defeated by political machinations - she was simply hidden from view, waiting to be rediscovered by those ready for complete divine truth.
This is why Wayists honor both Divine Parents - not from modern sensibility but from ancient wisdom. We understand that like any family, Heaven requires both Father and Mother working in perfect harmony. Anything less is artificially incomplete.
The question facing spiritual seekers today isn't whether to accept the divine feminine - it's whether we're ready to embrace complete divine reality rather than its artificially limited version. Our Mother in Heaven never left - she was just hidden by those who feared the power of complete divine truth. Her restoration isn't revolution - it's simply the return to natural wholeness.
CHAPTER 15
## Understanding the Divine
### Beyond anthropomorphism
*Anthropomorphism: the conception or representation of God with human qualities and affections, or in a human shape. *
Imagine trying to explain quantum physics to an ant. Not just difficult - impossible. The ant's consciousness simply can't grasp such concepts. Now consider this: The gap between human consciousness and the Absolute source of all existence is infinitely greater than the gap between ant and quantum physicist.
This is why Wayists understand that the Absolute - the ultimate source of all existence - is beyond human comprehension. We call it "THAT" because any other name, any attempt to describe it, would only diminish its true nature. It's not a being we can know or relate to - it's the ground of all being, the source of all that is.
Think about it: Our human minds, which can't even fully explain what love is or comprehend the vastness of our own galaxy, presume to understand the source of all existence? The moment we try to anthropomorphize the Absolute - make it into a human-like figure with human-like emotions and needs - we've already lost our way.
This is where Christianity took a dramatic turn from Lord Jesus' original teaching. By identifying the Absolute Creator with the tribal god of Judaism, they created a divine figure who displays very human traits:
- Anger and jealousy
- Need for worship and sacrifice
- Favoritism toward certain groups
- Desire for revenge
- Notions to genocide
Lord Jesus taught something completely different. When he spoke of "God our Father in Heaven," he wasn't referring to the Absolute. He was teaching about the divine beings who oversee our spiritual evolution - the rulers of our particular heaven, which in the Sanskrit is referred to as Sukhavati.
Think of it this way: Just as a university president isn't the creator of the universe, our Divine Parents in Heaven aren't the Absolute Creator. They're highly evolved spiritual beings who:
- Guide our spiritual evolution
- Demonstrate the qualities we're developing
- Show us what we can become
- Oversee the school of soul evolution
When Lord Jesus said, "Be compassionate as your Father in Heaven is compassionate," he was pointing to an attainable ideal. It is rather ludicrous to think Lord Jesus would suggest we emulate the Absolute. But he said that we can actually develop the qualities of these divine beings of our Heaven because that's precisely what we're here to do. We're evolving from soul-beings into spirit-beings of their type.
### This understanding changes everything
- Instead of trying to please an unknowable, often-angry deity
- We're developing our own divine potential
- Following the example of beings we can actually comprehend
- Growing into the same type of spiritual being they are
### Our Divine Parents don't
- Demand worship
- Punish or reward anyone
- Require sacrifice
- Play favorites
### Instead, they
- Guide our evolution
- Demonstrate divine qualities
- Provide opportunities for growth
- Love unconditionally
Yes, we use terms like "Father" and "Mother," and spiritual art depicts them in human form. But this is for our benefit - like using stick figures to represent complex mathematical concepts. The reality is that divine beings are energy structures of pure consciousness, beyond physical form or human limitation. They are alike to Father and Mother because the seed of our spirit planted in our Anahata charka when first we came to Butterfly Path comes from the Father and through loving-kindness that seed will sprout and the yin-spiritual energies from Heaven, managed by our Mother will nurture it, keep it safe, and help us to mature as hybrid soul-spirit beings so we will one day be born into Heaven.
### We use these images and terms because
- Our brains need relatable images for concepts
- Our languages require pronouns
- Our understanding needs frameworks
- Our hearts seek connection
But we never mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon itself.
### This understanding transforms how we live
- We focus on actual transformation, not just belief
- We understand our divine potential is real, not metaphorical
- We see spiritual evolution as natural, not supernatural
- We recognize that becoming divine is our destiny
When Lord Jesus said "You are gods," he wasn't speaking metaphorically. He was describing our actual potential - to evolve into the same type of spiritual being as him and our heavenly parents.
This is why Wayists aren't trying to appease an angry god or earn salvation through belief. We're engaged in the practical work of spiritual evolution, following a path that Lord Jesus and countless others have walked before us.
In our next chapter, we'll explore how this understanding transforms our view of paradise, heaven, and the soul's journey through multiple lives. But first, take a moment to feel the liberation in this truth - you're not here to worship or obey, but to evolve into your divine nature.
## Beyond Worship to Relationship
Traditional religion teaches us to worship a distant deity. Lord Jesus taught something radically different -- direct spiritual communion with a divine guide who:
- Knows you intimately
- Understands your journey
- Communicates through intuition and direct knowing
- Provides exactly the guidance you need
Think of your Divine Tara not as a remote authority figure, but as a wise, loving mentor who has walked this path before and knows exactly what you're experiencing.
CHAPTER 16
## Our Divine Parents
### A different understanding
Imagine discovering that the founder and director of your school isn't the creator of the universe. Sounds obvious when put that way, doesn't it? Yet this simple distinction - between the guides of our spiritual education and the ultimate source of existence - transforms everything about how we understand our spiritual journey.
God our Father (Skt. Amitabha) and God our Mother (Skt. Pandarajanani) in Heaven are the divine beings who oversee our soul's evolution, much like wise parents running the ultimate educational institution. In Sanskrit, Amitabha means "Infinite Light King of Heaven," while Pandarajanani means "Jasmin Light Queen of Heaven." These aren't just titles - they describe the yang and yin aspects of divine energies and guidance styles that shape our school and our growth. Spiritual beings have no gender but they choose what type of energy is needed for a task and will hold that energy. Therefore, God our Father of Heaven holds yang energy dominance in his being, and our Mother holds yin energy dominance. Different tasks require different energy dominance.
Think of Land of Pure Bliss (Skt. Sukhavati), our spirit heaven, as the most advanced healing institute you can imagine - not a place of eternal rest, but a realm of joyous activity and continued growth. Attached to this institute is a school of divinity for souls who come to learn to be eternal workers in this field, and the campus is planet Earth. Our Divine Parents aren't distant administrators but active teachers and guides who:
- Design perfect learning experiences
- Demonstrate divine qualities
- Provide growth opportunities
- Support our evolution
- Show us what we can become
Here's what's remarkable: These divine beings are naturally, effortlessly beneficent. Just as water naturally flows downhill, they naturally:
- Express perfect compassion
- Demonstrate complete wisdom
- Share unconditional love
- Serve without expectation
### They don't
- Need our worship
- Demand sacrifices
- Judge our failures
- Play favorites
- Punish mistakes
### Instead, they
- Guide our education
- Support our growth
- Provide opportunities
- Demonstrate possibilities
- Love unconditionally
As with any top university course, sometimes it's hard and students struggle to master the skills. But the administrators will never do anyone the disservice to take the lesson away. You need all the skills required to graduate and they want to help us all graduate.
This understanding transforms spiritual practice from religious obligation into conscious participation in our own evolution. When we meditate, we're not petitioning a distant deity - we're developing the consciousness that will let us graduate into spiritual being. When we practice energy work, we're not performing religious ritual - we're developing the skills we'll need as divine beings ourselves.
Yes, spiritual art depicts our Divine Parents in human form, and yes, we use terms like "Father" and "Mother." But this is for our benefit - like using models to teach complex astronomy. The reality is far more profound - these are energy structures of pure consciousness, demonstrating what we're evolving toward.
### Consider how this changes everything
- Prayer becomes communion rather than petition
- Service becomes natural rather than obligatory
- Growth becomes evolution rather than moral struggle
- Practice becomes development rather than religious duty
Most importantly, it changes how we see ourselves. We're not sinful creatures needing salvation, but developing beings in a perfectly designed school of spiritual evolution. Every experience, pleasant or challenging, serves our growth toward divine consciousness.
### This is why our Divine Parents created the structure of
- Multiple lives for gaining experience
- Karma for perfect educational design
- Divine Taras for personal guidance
- Energy practices for skill development
- Community for mutual support
When Lord Jesus taught about "God our Father in Heaven," he was pointing to this profound reality - not a distant creator to be feared, but a divine being showing us what we can become. When he demonstrated healing and wisdom, he wasn't showing divine power to be worshipped, but divine abilities we're meant to develop.
### Understanding our Divine Parents correctly reveals
- The true purpose of life (evolution to divine consciousness)
- The nature of spiritual growth (natural development, not moral testing)
- The reality of divine love (unconditional support, not judgment and punishment)
- The path of transformation (education and experience, not belief and worship)
### Think about how this transforms common religious concepts
- "God's will" isn't about blind submission but about understanding our curriculum
- "Divine judgment" is really about educational assessment
- "Heaven" isn't a reward but our future workplace and home
- "Service" isn't about pleasing a deity but developing professional skills
#### This explains why Lord Jesus emphasized
- Direct divine connection over religious worship
- Personal transformation over moral rules
- Energy healing over ritual practice
- Conscious evolution over belief systems
- Natural development over religious obligation
Most importantly, it helps us understand our own journey. Every challenge becomes an opportunity for growth, every joy a glimpse of our future state, every difficulty a perfectly designed learning experience. We're not trying to appease an angry god or earn our way into paradise. We're developing the consciousness and capabilities that will let us graduate into our divine nature.
In our next chapter, we'll explore what this means for how we understand heaven, paradise, and the soul's journey through multiple lives. But first, take a moment to feel how this understanding changes everything. You're not here to appease divine authority but to develop divine nature. You're not working for salvation but growing toward graduation. You're not a fallen creature but a developing divine being.
This is the truth that sets us free - not from sin and punishment, but from the very idea that we need religious salvation. Our salvation was already given -- the freedom to grow in spirit without the limiting oppression of religions. We're already on the path of divine becoming. Our task is simply to walk it consciously.
CHAPTER 17
## The Butterfly Path
### More than just a metaphor
Imagine if someone told a caterpillar, "Inside you lies the DNA of a butterfly." The caterpillar, busy munching leaves and focused on competition and survival, might find this hard to believe. Yet within it lies everything needed for an extraordinary transformation. This is precisely our situation as human souls.
When Lord Jesus spoke of being "born again, in spirit" he wasn't talking about a religious conversion or a moral reformation. He was describing something far more profound - our actual metamorphosis from soul-being to spirit-being. Just as a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, we're designed to evolve from earthbound soul consciousness into divine spiritual awareness.
This isn't just poetic symbolism. Consider what happens in a chrysalis: The caterpillar (our soul) literally dissolves, its entire being reorganizing into something completely new. While this transformation appears magical from the outside, it's actually the unfolding of a design written into the caterpillar's very essence. A seed of the divine from God our Father in Heaven was placed in our Anahata mind (heart chakra) when we first joined Butterfly Path and was processed in Paradise for our first human incarnation. Therefore, similar to the caterpillar, the capacity for divine transformation is already written into your spiritual DNA.
And that is why God our Father in Heaven is said to be our Father. Our spirit started from that seed and was "germinated" in the womb of the heart, nursed by God our Mother in Heaven.
But here's where the human journey becomes even more remarkable. Unlike caterpillars, who transform automatically when the time is right, we must consciously participate in our metamorphosis. Each life experience, each challenge, each joy and sorrow provides raw material for our transformation - but only if we engage with it consciously.
## Think about the stages
### The Caterpillar Stage (Soul Consciousness)
- Focused primarily on survival and success
- Consuming experiences hungrily
- Building the resources needed for transformation
- Not yet aware of the butterfly potential within
### The Chrysalis Stage (Awakening)
- Beginning to sense something more
- Experiencing inner dissolution and reorganization
- Letting go of old patterns
- Developing new capabilities
### The Butterfly Stage (Spirit Consciousness)
- Emerging into new dimensions of being
- Experiencing reality from a completely new perspective
- Developing natural divine qualities
- Operating in higher frequencies of existence
Earth isn't just our home where our caterpillar junior souls carry on - it's also our chrysalis, precisely calibrated to facilitate this transformation. Every condition here, from the most challenging to the most beautiful, serves our metamorphosis. This is why Lord Jesus emphasized living fully rather than escaping from life. Everything here is curriculum for our transformation.
The beauty of this understanding is that it makes sense of both life's pleasures and its challenges. Just as a caterpillar needs to eat exactly the right things to fuel its transformation, we need all our experiences - pleasant and difficult - to facilitate our evolution. Nothing is wasted, nothing is random, everything serves the process.
### Consider how this transforms daily life
- Every challenge becomes transformative opportunity
- Every relationship becomes a catalyst for growth
- Every experience provides material for metamorphosis
- Every moment offers a chance to evolve
This is why Lord Jesus taught us to be "wise as serpents" (understanding natural transformation and the natural rhythm of kundalini circling) and "innocent as doves" (maintaining pure spirit intention). He was showing us how to engage consciously with our own metamorphosis.
Remember: You're not trying to become something foreign to your nature. Like the caterpillar contains everything needed to become a butterfly, you already possess everything required for divine transformation. The Path is about allowing this natural evolution to unfold through conscious participation.
CHAPTER 18
## Beyond Religion
### Lord Jesus' Essential Message
When Lord Jesus taught in Galilee, he wasn't starting a religion. He had in fact already taught in Egypt, all over Parthia, western China and northern India when he came to Galilee. He spoke of something far more profound than another religion -- a universal path of spiritual evolution available to every human soul. Let's explore what he actually taught, and why it matters today.
First, we need to clear away some misconceptions. Lord Jesus didn't teach about a judgmental God keeping score of our sins. He didn't promote the idea of eternal punishment for non-believers. And he certainly didn't suggest that simply believing in him would guarantee salvation. These ideas came later, shaped by Judeo religious and Roman political needs.
Instead, Lord Jesus taught about what we call "Butterfly Path" -- the journey of soul evolution. Think about how a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly. It's not about the caterpillar believing in butterflies or following butterfly rules. It's about actual transformation. This is what Lord Jesus meant when he told Nicodemus, "You must be born again... of spirit."
### Let's look at what this means
Every human is a soul attending what we might call a cosmic university. Earth is our campus, and each lifetime is a semester of learning experiences. We're here to evolve from soul-consciousness to spirit-consciousness -- from caterpillar to butterfly.
This is why Lord Jesus spent so much time healing and teaching energy work. He trained hundreds of energy healers because understanding and working with spiritual energy is crucial for our evolution. When Christians later wrote about Lord Jesus casting out "demons," they were actually describing his work with disturbed soul energies -- something very different from the religious concept of demonic possession.
Lord Jesus taught about "God our Father and God our Mother in Heaven" -- not as threatening judges, but as wise guides overseeing our spiritual education. They don't demand worship or threaten punishment. Instead, they provide opportunities for growth through the natural law of karma.
This brings us to another key teaching: karma isn't punishment or reward. It's more like a perfectly designed curriculum, giving each soul exactly the experiences needed for growth. When Lord Jesus said "Judge not," he wasn't just giving moral advice -- he was explaining that we can't judge others because we don't know their soul's journey or what lessons they need to learn.
Perhaps most importantly, Lord Jesus taught that every human has a Divine Tara -- a spiritual guide assigned to help us evolve. Just before leaving Earth, he promised to ask "the Father" to send these helpers to all humanity. Christians later transformed this teaching about spiritual guides into the concept of the Holy Spirit as part of a divine trinity.
### Think of it this way: If you went to college, would it help more to
- Believe in the existence of universities
- Or actually attend classes and learn?
Lord Jesus taught the path of actual transformation, not just belief. He showed that each of us has divine potential, waiting to be developed through conscious effort and direct spiritual experience.
This is why he often said things like "You will do greater things than these." He wasn't setting himself up as an object of worship, but demonstrating what's possible for every soul willing to do the work of transformation.
Understanding these teachings helps explain why Lord Jesus sometimes frustrated religious authorities. To them, he was threatening the established order. To him, he was showing a universal path of spiritual evolution that transcends all religious boundaries.
Christians confess that the Jews are their God's chosen people, and Jews confess in their scriptures that that the Christians are "God's broom" who sweep the road to Jewish control of the world. For the Wayist, this was not the teaching of Lord Jesus but the politics of soul-people religion.
In our next chapter, we'll explore how to apply Lord Jesus' true teachings practically in modern life. After all, Lord Jesus didn't teach theory -- he taught a living path of transformation. And that path is as relevant today as it was two thousand years ago.

Lord Jesus in the East
CHAPTER 19
## Beyond Sin
### Understanding "hamartia" - Missing the Mark in life's archery
Imagine learning archery. When you miss the target, does your instructor condemn you as evil and threaten eternal punishment? Of course not.
They understand you are learning, developing skill, improving your aim.
This is exactly what Lord Jesus meant when he used the Greek word 'hamartia' - which Christians translate as 'sin'.
Now, remember its that sin of yours which the Christians say, made their God to kill Jesus so his innocent blood pay for your sin. They say, that is why Jesus is your savior---to save you from their incredibly angry and cruel God who kills and annihilates nations and tortures people for eternity.
'Hamartia' literally means 'missing the mark.'
This isn't just clever wordplay - it transforms everything about how we view spiritual development. Instead of seeing ourselves as inherently sinful creatures deserving eternal punishment, we can recognize that we're souls in training, learning to aim our consciousness more truly with each experience.
**Think about how you view a child learning to walk.**
**You don't**
• Label their falls as moral failures
• Threaten punishment for stumbling
• Demand perfection from their first step
• Condemn them for their natural learning process
Yet somehow, religion took the natural process of spiritual growth and turned it into a system of eternal crimes and punishments. That's like condemning every toddler who stumbles to eternal torture - it makes no sense from any perspective of love or wisdom.
Here's where it gets interesting: Your 'mark' - your appropriate target - isn't the same as someone else's. Each soul has:
- Different levels of wisdom developed through past experiences
- Different lessons to master in this life
- Different capacities to work with
- Different growth trajectories for this incarnation
This is why Lord Jesus said 'Judge not' - we literally cannot know another's appropriate target. What might be 'missing the mark' for a highly evolved being could be perfectly appropriate for a younger soul. It's like expecting a first-grade math student to solve calculus problems - the expectation itself misses the mark.
### **Consider how this plays out in daily life**
A spirit-person might feel they've 'missed the mark' by:
- Walking past someone in need without helping
- Failing to maintain higher consciousness in a difficult situation
- Acting from lower rather than higher nature
- Missing opportunities to serve others
While a soul-person might not even notice these opportunities. Neither is 'sinning' in the religious sense - they're operating at their level of development, like students in different grades.
When Lord Jesus told the woman caught in adultery 'Neither do I condemn you,' he wasn't being lenient about sin. He was acknowledging that divine condemnation doesn't help anyone aim better. Instead, he said 'Go and miss the mark no more' - essentially saying 'Now you know better, aim better.'
**This understanding transforms how we view our own growth**
- Every miss becomes a learning opportunity
- Each failure offers wisdom for better aim
- All experience serves development
### **Growth becomes natural evolution rather than moral struggle**
It doesn't mean actions have no consequences. When you aim poorly:
• You create karmic lessons
• You might need to repeat experiences
• You can cause suffering for yourself and others
• You might delay your evolution
But these consequences are educational, not punitive. They're temporary, not eternal. They serve growth, not vengeance. The universe isn't interested in punishment - it's designed for education.
**The liberation in this understanding is profound**
• No eternal guilt
• No divine anger to fear
• No need for supernatural forgiveness
• Just natural growth through experience
When Lord Jesus said 'Your hamartia is forgiven,' he wasn't offering divine pardon - he was announcing freedom from the very concept of sin and divine punishment. He was pointing to a different understanding: we're all students in the divine school, learning to aim more truly with each experience.
That's why true spiritual teachers focus on practical guidance rather than moral condemnation. They're like archery instructors helping you improve your aim, not judges condemning your misses. The question isn't 'Am I sinning?' but rather 'Am I learning from my experiences? Am I growing in wisdom? Am I aiming to the best of my current ability?'
This is the profound truth that transforms everything: You're not a sinner needing salvation - you're an archer learning to aim more truly. Every miss is a lesson, every failure a step toward better aim, every experience an opportunity to develop greater skill in the art of divine living.
CHAPTER 20
## Beyond Repentance
### Understanding "metanoia"
When Lord Jesus taught about spiritual transformation, he used the Greek word "metanoia." Over time, this profound concept got reduced to the Christian idea of repentance - feeling sorry for sins and begging for forgiveness. But the original teaching was far more revolutionary. Metanoia literally means "to transform your consciousness" or "to reprogram your mind." The difference isn't just semantic - it's the difference between temporary emotional relief and permanent spiritual evolution.
Think of your mind like a computer. Repentance is like hitting "undo" on a mistakenly sent text. Metanoia is like rewriting the entire operating system so it cannot send such a text again. One addresses symptoms; the other transforms the whole system. When Lord Jesus talked about metanoia, he wasn't asking people to feel bad about their mistakes - he was showing them how to evolve beyond the consciousness that created those mistakes.
Lord Jesus knows that having to say you're sorry is a symptom of immaturity; what is needed is to not having to say you're sorry because there is action to be sorry about.
This understanding transforms common religious scenes in fascinating ways. Picture the woman weeping at Lord Jesus' feet. Traditional Christianity sees this as repentance - a sinner feeling remorse and seeking forgiveness. But what was really happening? She was experiencing metanoia - a profound transformation of consciousness. Her tears weren't about guilt; they were the natural release that comes with deep inner change.
The Christian focus on repentance has led to some troubling consequences. We've all seen people commit terrible acts, then claim all is well because they "repented and asked forgiveness." This cycle of sin-repent-repeat does nothing to transform consciousness. It's like repeatedly hitting "undo" without ever fixing the underlying program that keeps creating the same errors.
### **Real metanoia involves something much deeper**
- Recognizing your current programming
- Understanding how it limits you
- Consciously choosing new patterns
- Gradually transforming your entire consciousness
- Evolving from soul-mind to spirit-mind awareness
This isn't about feeling bad - it's about becoming different. It's not about emotional catharsis but actual transformation.
Think about how this plays out in real life. Say you lose your temper. The repentance approach would have you feel guilty and ask forgiveness. The metanoia approach guides you to:
- Understand what triggered the reaction
- Recognize the consciousness that created it
- Choose a different way of seeing and responding
- Transform the underlying patterns
- Develop new awareness that prevents future outbursts
**One leaves you prone to repeat the pattern; the other creates lasting change.**
When Lord Jesus said "Metanoia, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand," he wasn't demanding people feel guilty. He was announcing that higher consciousness is available now - if we're willing to transform our minds to perceive it. This is why he often expressed frustration with mere religious regret. He wasn't interested in temporary emotional fixes but in genuine transformation.
The practical implications are profound. Instead of endlessly repeating cycles of sin and repentance, we can focus on actual transformation. Rather than wallowing in guilt or seeking quick forgiveness, we can engage in the deeper work of consciousness evolution.
This understanding replaces religious guilt with opportunities for growth. Every challenging situation becomes not an occasion for sin and repentance, but a chance for metanoia - real transformation of consciousness. It's not about feeling bad about who you are; it's about evolving into who you can become.
Remember: Lord Jesus didn't teach repentance as a way to avoid divine punishment. He taught metanoia as a path to higher consciousness - a way to transform from soul-being to spirit-being through conscious evolution. The promise isn't that you'll feel better about your mistakes - it's that you'll evolve beyond the consciousness that creates them.
CHAPTER 21
## Beyond Equality and Fairness
### Understanding spiritual reality
In the school of divinity for souls that is Butterfly Path, we encounter a profound truth that challenges our modern sensibilities: souls are not equal, and life is not fair. Yet in this apparent injustice lies the perfect wisdom of divine education.
**Think about any school. On any given day, you'll find**
- First graders just learning to read
- High schoolers tackling calculus
- Graduate students doing advanced research
- Professors guiding it all
- Behind it all exist a huge system and many experts that make it all happen
Would it make sense to demand they all study the same material? To insist it's unfair that some are more advanced than others? Of course not. Different levels of development require different lessons.
The same is true on the spiritual path. Each soul joins this sacred journey at different times. Some have trod this path for countless ages, while others have only recently embarked. With each passing day, new souls arrive, swelling the ranks of spiritual seekers. Demanding they all be at the same level makes as much sense as insisting all students be in the same grade.
Moreover, each soul carries a unique karmic curriculum, tailored by divine intelligence to their specific needs and potential. No two paths are identical because no two souls require exactly the same lessons. Think about it - would you want a doctor who skipped certain medical classes because they were "too hard" or "unfair"?
In human society, we see clear evidence of this spiritual inequality. Some individuals demonstrate profound wisdom and compassion, while others remain entangled in base desires and ignorance. This isn't about moral judgment - it's about recognizing different stages of development.
Yet herein lies the sublime equity of Butterfly Path: all souls, regardless of their current stage, have the opportunity to progress. The path is open to all, irrespective of worldly status, education, or background. Your current position doesn't determine your potential - it just indicates where you're starting from in this incarnation.
Life's apparent unfairness - the disparities in health, wealth, talent, and circumstance - aren't random cruelties but precisely calibrated conditions for each soul's growth. The material wealth of one could be exactly what brings their soul to fall, while the physical disability of another might be exactly what brings their soul to enlightenment. We cannot and should not presume to know.
To demand equality of condition is to misunderstand the nature of soul education. It's like insisting that medical students should perform surgery on their first day because it's "unfair" that only experienced surgeons get to do it. True spiritual progress isn't measured against others but against your own past. The only meaningful comparison is between who you are today and who you were yesterday.
This understanding liberates us from both resentment and arrogance. Like students in different grades, we can appreciate everyone's position while focusing on our own growth. The senior soul has no cause for pride - they simply started the journey earlier. The younger soul has no cause for shame - they're exactly where they need to be for their development.
CHAPTER 22
## Beyond Scripture
### Why Lord Jesus left no holy book
Have you ever wondered why Lord Jesus, unlike other religious founders, never wrote down his teachings or commanded others to do so? The answer transforms how we understand spiritual growth: We don't need scripture because we have something far more profound - direct spiritual guidance and the innate wisdom of our own developing divine nature.
Think about Lord Jesus' actual approach to Jewish scripture. Far from endorsing it as divine truth, he consistently challenged its limitations. "You have heard it said... but I say to you" was his regular refrain, directly contrasting his higher teaching with traditional scripture, directly putting himself as higher authority over Moses the writer of the first 5 books of the Bible of the Abrahamic religions. When he told religious scholars they belonged to "the father of lies," he wasn't just being provocative - he was exposing how their teaching came from men with agendas, and if from their god, then -- wow -- what kind of god is that.
Consider the irony: Christianity claims to be based on the Bible, yet Lord Jesus himself repeatedly demonstrated that spiritual truth transcends written text. He showed this dramatically when confronting religious scholars who used scripture to condemn a woman caught in adultery. Rather than debating verses, he drew in the sand - perhaps symbolically showing how transient all written teachings are - while pointing to the deeper truth of compassion and transformation.
"The letter kills, but the spirit gives life," wrote Paul, capturing perhaps the only thing he got right about Lord Jesus' teaching. Yet Christianity proceeded to create exactly what Lord Jesus avoided - a religion based on written text rather than living spiritual experience.
**Why don't Wayists need scripture? Because we have**
- Direct guidance from our Divine Taras
- The living wisdom of actual experience
- The natural development of dharma
- The precise curriculum of karma
- The constant presence of divine support
Think about how nature works. Do birds need a manual to build nests? Do flowers need scripture to know how to bloom? Divine wisdom operates through direct knowing, not through memorizing texts. Lord Jesus demonstrated this by teaching through stories and experiences rather than creating doctrine.
When he said "The kingdom of heaven is within you," he was pointing to this profound truth - that divine wisdom emerges through inner development, not external authority. Everything we need for spiritual evolution is already built into the system:
- Karma provides perfect learning experiences
- Divine Taras offer precise guidance
- Life itself presents exactly what we need to grow
- Our own developing wisdom shows the way
This doesn't mean we can't learn from others' insights or that writing down teachings has no value. But it does mean that no text, no matter how revered, can substitute for direct spiritual experience and development. The living teaching always transcends the written word.
**Consider how Lord Jesus himself taught - not by having disciples memorize texts, but by**
- Showing them how to heal
- Teaching them to sense energy
- Demonstrating divine qualities
- Guiding their direct experience
- Connecting them with their Taras
He was establishing a living tradition of transformation, not creating another religion of the book. When he promised to send a holy spirit as a *parakletos* for everyone (often mistranslated as "comforter"), he was ensuring we would have direct spiritual guidance, making scripture unnecessary.
This understanding liberates us from the endless debates about interpreting holy texts. Our focus isn't on what's written in ancient books but on what's developing in our consciousness right now. The truth we need isn't locked in scripture but alive in our evolving spiritual awareness.
CHAPTER 23
## Paradise
### Not your final destination
Imagine checking into a beautiful retreat center between university semesters. It's a place to rest, reflect on what you've learned, and prepare for your next term. That's Paradise (or *Purusthana* in Sanskrit) in Wayist understanding - not an eternal reward for belief, but a temporary waystation for souls between lives. It's a place of profound peace and beauty, yes, but it's not your final destination.
This understanding is radically different from the Christian concept of Paradise as an eternal reward or punishment based on one lifetime's beliefs. When Lord Jesus spoke of Paradise, he was describing something far more practical - a crucial part of our spiritual education system.
**Think about what you need between phases of intensive learning**
- Time to process your experiences
- Space to integrate new wisdom
- Healing from life's challenges
- Preparation for your next phase
- Connection with fellow travelers
This is exactly what Paradise provides. When you leave your physical body (what we call death), your Divine Tara guides you to this realm of rest and integration. Here, you experience:
- Deep reflection on your completed life
- Integration of new understanding
- Healing from difficult experiences
- Preparation for your next incarnation
- Communion with other souls
The length of your stay varies according to your needs an karmic curriculum. Some souls process quickly and reincarnate almost immediately. Others need more time to integrate their experiences before taking on their next life lesson. There's no judgment, no eternal reward or punishment - just a natural part of the soul's educational journey.
Here's where many get confused: Paradise (Purusthana) and Heaven (Sukhavati) are completely different realms serving different purposes. Consider the differences:
**Paradise**
- Temporary waystation
- For souls between lives
- Part of the reincarnation cycle
- Place of reflection and preparation
- In the realm of soul energies
**Heaven (Sukhavati)**
- Eternal spiritual realm
- For graduated divine beings
- Beyond the reincarnation cycle
- Place of divine service and continued evolution
- In the realm of spirit energies
**Understanding this transforms how we view both life and death**
- Death isn't an ending but a transition
- Life's experiences aren't judged but integrated
- Every experience contributes to our evolution
- Nothing is wasted or lost
- Each life adds another layer of wisdom
Most importantly, it frees us from the anxiety of trying to "earn" eternal paradise through belief or behavior. Instead, we understand that Paradise is simply part of our natural cycle of growth and evolution. It's not about being good enough to get in - it's about what you do with the experience while you're there.
Remember when Lord Jesus told the thief on the cross "Today you will be with me in Paradise"? He wasn't offering a last-minute escape from hell. He was acknowledging a universal truth - that all souls return to Paradise between lives to process, integrate, and prepare for continued growth.
**This is why Wayists approach death differently**
- We understand it's a natural transition
- We know our Divine Tara guides us
- We recognize it as part of our evolution
- We see it as a pause between chapters
- We face it without religious fear
**However, this doesn't mean we're eager to die at any time - each life is precious because**
- Every experience offers growth
- Every challenge brings wisdom
- Every relationship teaches love
- Every life adds to our evolution
- Every moment is an opportunity
In our next chapter, we'll explore how reincarnation works - not as punishment or reward, but as the perfectly designed educational system it is. But first, consider how this understanding of Paradise transforms your view of life and death. You're not working toward a final judgment but participating in an ongoing journey of evolution. Each life, each death, each rest in Paradise - all are part of your path toward becoming a divine being.
Going to Heaven, is different. That happens when we graduate from this school of divinity for souls. Upon graduation (we don't know if there is like a ceremony with spirit togas and flat hats and stuff, or angels playing trumpets in heaven's mariachi band, we just don't know), upon which we are reborn in Heaven as fledgling immortal spiritual beings and we will undergo schooling and training to fulfil our duties and mature.
The question isn't "Will you make it to Paradise?" but rather "What will you learn from each visit there?" This is the profound truth that transforms death from a fearful ending into a natural transition in our eternal journey of becoming.
CHAPTER 24
## Reincarnation
### More than just coming back
Think about this: How much wisdom can you really gain in one lifetime? How many perspectives can you truly understand? How many lessons can you deeply learn in just seventy or eighty years? Now imagine trying to evolve from a soul being into a divine spirit with just one shot at human experience. It simply doesn't add up.
This is why reincarnation isn't some exotic belief but a practical necessity for spiritual evolution. Until the 6th century, Lord Jesus' teaching on the reality of reincarnation was openly taught. Then something fascinating happened: A Byzantine empress, troubled by the implications for her own behavior, pressured the Church to erase it from Christian teaching and burn the books that reference it. But you can't erase truth by editing books.
Reincarnation in Wayist understanding isn't about punishment or reward. It's about education. Think of it like this: Earth is a cosmic university, each lifetime is a semester, and karma is your academic advisor - not judging you, but making sure you get exactly the courses you need for graduation.
**Your curriculum might include being**
- Rich in one life, poor in another
- Male in some lives, female in others
- Powerful and powerless
- Teacher and student
- Every race, every culture, every circumstance
Why such variety? Because to become a divine being capable of understanding and helping all souls, you need to have walked in all shoes. You can't truly comprehend the human experience from just one perspective. This is why racism becomes absurd when you understand reincarnation - you're literally prejudiced against your own past and future selves.
**The evidence is closer than you might think.**
**Have you ever**
- Met someone and felt you've known them forever?
- Been to a new place and somehow known your way around?
- Had skills or interests that don't match your upbringing?
- Known something without knowing how you know it?
- Felt inexplicably drawn to certain cultures or times?
These aren't just quirks - they're echoes of your longer journey. Think about child prodigies. How does a three-year-old master complex mathematics or music? The Wayist understanding is simple: they're not learning it for the first time - they're remembering.

**Here's where it gets interesting. Between lives**
- Your brain knowledge is wiped clean (because it belongs to the body). Knowledge and information dies with the brain.
- But your soul and spirit wisdom remains
- Your spirit development continues
- Your karmic curriculum updates
- Your Divine Tara maintains guidance
This is why you don't remember past lives in detail - that would be useless like trying to remember what you had for breakfast ten years ago. Or that Paeter Zolbuwaski never paid you for that lamb he bought before you died 160 years ago. It's not the details of an experience or life that matter, but the wisdom gained from the experience.
**This understanding resolves the massive problems in Christian theology. If you only live once, what happens to**
- People who die as infants?
- Those born and raised in other religious cultures?
- The billions who lived before Christianity?
- Those born into other faiths and their only experience with Lord Jesus was when Christians came with soldiers and took their lands, killed their children and raped their resources?
- Those with severe mental limitations?
The Christian answer - that they all go to hell - creates a cruel and arbitrary god. The Wayist understanding of reincarnation reveals a universe of perfect justice and unlimited opportunity for growth.
### Understanding reincarnation changes everything
- It eliminates the fear of death
- It explains life's seeming injustices
- It gives purpose to all experience
- It reveals the perfect justice of karma (which is neither reward nor punishment, just curriculum)
- It shows how every soul has the opportunity to evolve
Most importantly, it frees us from the desperate notion that we have just one brief life to "get it right or burn forever." Instead, we understand that we're all on a journey of growth, each learning at our own pace, each having exactly the experiences we need for evolution.
This is why Lord Jesus spoke of being "born again" - not as a one-time religious conversion, but as a literal description of the soul's journey toward divine awareness. It's not about believing the right things - it's about growing through experience until you evolve into a being of pure wisdom and compassion.
There's a profound difference between religious knowledge and direct spiritual understanding. You can memorize scripture forever and still miss the essential truth that comes only through direct experience. Rumi, who abandoned religious scholarship for mystical realization, expresses this perfectly:

*Soul receives from spirit*
*that knowledge, therefore not by book*
*nor from tongue. If knowledge of mysteries come*
*after emptiness of mind, that is illumination of heart.*
This is exactly what Lord Jesus meant when he said, 'You search the scriptures... but will not find me.' Real spiritual understanding doesn't come from studying texts but from direct experience of divine reality.
In our next chapter, we'll explore what this means for understanding hell - not as a place of eternal punishment, but as a teaching about the natural consequences of our choices. But first, consider how this understanding of reincarnation transforms your view of your current life. Every experience, every relationship, every challenge becomes part of your larger journey of becoming. Nothing is wasted, nothing is final, and every moment offers an opportunity for growth.
CHAPTER 25
## Beyond Hell
### Not what you think
Picture yourself standing at the edge of an ancient garbage dump outside Jerusalem's walls. The air is thick with the stench of burning refuse and sulfur. This is Gehenna - the Valley of Hinnom - where unclaimed bodies and city waste were constantly burning. This very real place became the inspiration for something far more insidious: the concept of eternal hell.
When Lord Jesus spoke about "ending up in Gehenna," he wasn't threatening eternal damnation. He was making a practical point about natural consequences: Live a self-centered life that leaves you without genuine connections, and you might end up like those forgotten bodies in the dump. It was a teaching about community and karma, not divine punishment.
So how did we get from a cautionary tale about a garbage dump to elaborate visions of a cosmic torture chamber? The transformation reveals more about human psychology than divine reality. Religious authorities discovered that fear of eternal punishment was an excellent way to control behavior and maintain power. After all, what wouldn't you do to avoid endless torture?
But think about this logically: Would any decent human parent torture their child eternally for any crime? Even the worst human tyrants eventually let their victims die. Yet Christianity asks us to believe in a god who is less merciful than the cruelest human, a deity who punishes finite crimes with infinite torture. This tells us nothing about divine reality and everything about the human capacity to use fear as a control mechanism.
The Wayist understanding is far more practical and profound: Actions have natural consequences. Live selfishly, and you create the conditions for your own suffering. No angry god or pitchfork-wielding demons required - just the precise workings of karma ensuring we get exactly the experiences we need for growth.
This doesn't mean actions have no consequences. Far from it. Karma is exquisitely precise in crafting exactly the learning experiences each soul needs. But these consequences are educational, not punitive. They're temporary, not eternal. They serve growth, not revenge.
Think of it like touching a hot stove. The pain isn't punishment - it's education. You learn not to touch hot stoves not because you fear eternal burning, but because you understand cause and effect. This is how karma actually works - providing exactly the experiences we need to learn and grow.
The beauty of this understanding is that it frees us from the crippling fear of eternal damnation while maintaining perfect justice. Every action has its natural consequence, every choice creates its corresponding experience, but nothing is eternal except growth and transformation.
When Lord Jesus urged people to "fear not," he wasn't just offering comfort - he was pointing to this profound truth. There is no eternal hell, only temporary experiences designed for our evolution. Understanding this transforms how we live. Instead of acting from fear of punishment, we can act from wisdom about natural consequences. Instead of worrying about eternal damnation, we can focus on present growth.
This understanding brings remarkable freedom. We're not trapped in a cosmic drama of possible eternal torture. We're students in a perfectly designed school where every experience, pleasant or painful, serves our evolution toward divine consciousness. That's not a threat - it's a promise.
CHAPTER 26
## The Three Qualities
### Passion, Dispassion and non-Interference
Imagine standing at a crossroads where three paths meet. One burns with intense passion, another radiates cool detachment, and the third - more subtle but ultimately more powerful - flows like water, affecting everything while forcing nothing. These are the three fundamental qualities that shape how we engage with life.
### Let's start with Passion
Picture a raging fire - hot, intense, all-consuming. This is the energy that drives creation and destruction, that fuels desire and aversion. It's the force behind ambition, creativity, and transformation. But like fire, it can either warm a home or burn it down. Unchecked passion consumes everything in its path, including the one wielding it.
### Now consider Dispassion
Think of ice - cool, clear, utterly detached. This is the energy of withdrawal, of stepping back from the world's chaos. It brings clarity and perspective, but taken to extremes, it can freeze the heart and cut us off from life's vital flow. Perfect detachment might seem spiritual, but it can become another form of escape.
### But there's a third way, more subtle and profound: Non-Interference
Like water, it influences without forcing, shapes without breaking, accomplishes without dominating. Think about water's power - it carved the Grand Canyon not through force but through persistent, gentle flow. It nourishes life not by commanding but by offering itself freely.
When we operate in Non-Interference:
- We act without asserting
- We lead without dominating
- We help without controlling
- We love without possessing
This isn't passive acceptance of everything - it's skillful engagement that respects the natural flow of life. Like a master martial artist who redirects force rather than opposing it directly, Non-Interference accomplishes more by forcing less.
The advanced soul-spirit alone can maintain this balanced approach. It's easy to be passionate - just react to everything. It's relatively simple to be detached - just withdraw from engagement. But to remain actively engaged while not interfering with the natural flow of things? That takes wisdom and skill.
### Consider how this plays out in daily life
**When someone is angry with you**
- Passion would fight back
- Dispassion would withdraw
- Non-Interference would stay engaged without becoming entangled
**When facing injustice**
- Passion would attack the wrongdoers
- Dispassion would declare it all illusion
- Non-Interference would work for change without creating more conflict
This is why Lord Jesus could challenge the powerful without becoming bitter, engage with suffering without becoming overwhelmed, and love profoundly without creating dependency. He mastered the art of Non-Interference - total engagement without forcing or controlling.
The power of Non-Interference comes precisely from its seeming weakness. By not opposing force directly, it preserves energy. By not demanding control, it gains influence. By not forcing outcomes, it accomplishes more lasting change.
This might be why Lord Jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth. He wasn't praising weakness but pointing to the supreme power of Non-Interference. Like water wearing away stone, gentle persistence accomplishes more than fierce force.
CHAPTER 27
## The Three Core Spiritual Powers
### Humility, Simplicity, and Compassion
Think about what makes water so powerful - not its hardness, but its perfect humility. It flows to the lowest places, adapts to any container, and yet nothing in nature is stronger. This isn't a coincidence. When Lord Jesus taught about "the three powers that cannot be conquered," he was pointing to something profound: Humility, Simplicity, and Compassion are the most potent forces in spiritual evolution.
**Humility**
Let's start with Humility. But forget everything religion has taught you about humility as self-abasement or feeling small. True humility is like water - completely flexible yet incredibly powerful. It's not about thinking less of yourself; it's about being authentic enough to not think about yourself at all. When you're truly humble, you're free to be exactly who you are without pretense or performance.
Look at any highly evolved being - whether human or divine - and you'll find genuine humility. It's not an affected modesty but a natural state, like water naturally flowing downhill. They don't try to be humble; they simply are humble because they understand reality clearly. This is why Lord Jesus said he was "humble and gentle of heart" - not as a moral boast but as a description of natural spiritual evolution.
**Simplicity**
Then there's Simplicity. Again, this isn't about denial or deprivation. Think of how nature operates - a seed doesn't need a manual to know how to grow, a bird doesn't need instructions to build its nest. True simplicity is about aligning with the natural flow of things rather than complicating them unnecessarily. It's about knowing what's genuinely needed and not being distracted by excess. Contracts that are simple, and instructions that are simple, and personal life philosophies that are simple, stand the test of time.
When you embrace authentic simplicity, life becomes clearer, decisions become easier, and action becomes more effective. You discover that most of our complications come from trying to be something we're not or having more than we need. As Lord Jesus demonstrated, you can live simply while engaging fully with life.
**Compassion**
Finally, there's Compassion, which reaches its highest expression in what we call chrestotes - the ability to know exactly what will truly help in any situation. Chrestotes is often states as Helpful Loving-kindness in our writings. Chrestotes isn't just feeling sorry for others or trying to fix their problems. It's about developing the wisdom to know what real help looks like, combined with the skill to provide it effectively. Sometimes no action is the best help.
Think about how Lord Jesus expressed compassion. Sometimes it looked like healing, sometimes like teaching, sometimes like challenging people's assumptions. His compassion wasn't sentimental - it was precisely what each person needed for their growth. This is chrestotes - compassion guided by wisdom and expressed with skill.
These three powers work together:
- Humility keeps us authentic and receptive
- Simplicity keeps us clear and focused
- Compassion keeps us connected and helpful
When all three are developed:
- Your humility becomes a source of strength
- Your simplicity becomes a source of effectiveness
- Your compassion becomes a source of true help
This is why Lord Jesus said these three powers cannot be conquered and are the highest spiritual skills and powers. True spiritual powers such as our deities have cannot be conquered. Not because they're forceful, but because they work with reality rather than against it. They can disempower the energies of any opponent because they have the superior energy skills. Like water flowing around obstacles rather than fighting them, these powers accomplish more by forcing less.
CHAPTER 28
## Divine Taras
### Not Angels, not Saints, but Something More
Imagine having a personal mentor who knows exactly where you are in your spiritual development, what you need to learn next, and how best to help you grow. Now imagine this mentor has been with you since you first stepped arrived in Paradise and stepped onto the path of spiritual evolution, and will stay with you until you graduate. This is your Divine Tara - and understanding this relationship transforms everything about spiritual growth.
The Sanskrit word "Tara" means "one who helps cross over" - like a ferry operator helping you cross a river. But this ancient title barely hints at the profound reality of what a Divine Tara actually is. These aren't angels delivering messages or saints granting wishes. They're graduated spiritual beings who've completed their own evolution and now serve as expert guides for others on the path.
One of Lord Jesus' final acts was to request more Divine Taras for humanity. As he said: "I will ask the Father, and he will provide you a holy spirit helper, to be with you forever." Christianity later transformed this teaching about personal spiritual guides into the concept of the Holy Spirit, missing the profound practical implications of having a Divine Tara.
### Think about how this actually works. Your Tara communicates through
- Intuitive knowing that seems to arise from nowhere
- Sudden insights that change your perspective
- Dreams that offer guidance
- Energy attunement that you can actually feel
- Mystical experiences that transform your understanding
### But don't expect
- Voices in your head telling you what to do
- Supernatural displays of power
- Fortune-telling about your future
- Removal of life's necessary challenges
Your Tara is a guide and mentor, not a cosmic problem-solver. They're here to support your evolution, not to do the growing for you.
This relationship is crucial because we're hybrid beings - part soul, part developing spirit. This makes us:
- Uniquely capable of profound evolution
- Vulnerable to confusion and distraction
- Prone to energy disturbances
- In need of expert guidance
Think of it like learning to fly a sophisticated aircraft. Having an experienced instructor doesn't make the learning unnecessary, but it makes it much safer and more effective. Your Tara provides the guidance you need to navigate the complex journey of spiritual evolution.
### Strengthening your connection with your Tara involves
- Regular spiritual practice
- Growing energy awareness
- Living consciously
- Being open to guidance
- Patient development of the relationship
Over time, this connection naturally deepens. You begin to recognize your Tara's guidance more clearly, trust it more deeply, and work with it more effectively. It becomes like having a wise friend who's always there, ready to help but never imposing.
The beauty of this understanding is that it shows how personal spiritual growth really works. You're not alone on this path, trying to figure everything out by yourself. You have an expert guide who knows exactly what you need and how to help you develop it.
This was one of Lord Jesus' greatest gifts to humanity - not just teaching about Divine Taras but actually arranging for more of them to help human evolution. He wasn't creating a religion; he was ensuring we would have the guidance we need for genuine spiritual transformation.
CHAPTER 29
## Dharma
### More than just duty
Imagine having an internal GPS that becomes more accurate with every life experience - not just for directions but for every choice, every action, every response to life. It forms your automatic response to situations. It form your worldview and your way of thinking which navigates you through lifetimes.
This is dharma - your evolving inner sense of "right action" that develops through wisdom gained from actual experience. It becomes who you are, how you express your self in lifetimes.
Think of it this way: You have an experience. You reflect on it and gain wisdom. This wisdom creates new understanding. This understanding automatically generates a deeper sense of what's right. This becomes your new baseline for action. It's not about following rules - it's about developing natural wisdom that guides your choices.
Wisdom develops in layers and with each layer of wisdom we lay down about a particular subject / topic increases our dhramic sense of duty and right and wrong.
Consider a simple example: You experience being deceived. Through reflection, you understand deeply how it hurts on so many levels and why honesty matters. This creates a new layer of wisdom about truth and fidelity. This naturally generates an inner drive for honesty and not causing that pain in others. Being truthful and benign becomes part of your nature, not just a rule you follow, it becomes who you are. That's dharma in action. And every individual has their own dharmic sense. We are not equal.
Unlike religious morality, which imposes rules from outside, dharma develops from within through actual experience and understanding. It's like the difference between memorizing dance steps and developing a natural sense of rhythm. One is mechanical; the other flows naturally from deep understanding.
Here's what makes dharma fascinating: Wisdom develops in layers. One can develop wisdom about a Wayist worldview, and over time many new layers of wisdom develop on top of that one you initially had -- the wisdom deepens. And so it is with everything else. Every layer of wisdom automatically generates its own layer of dharma:
- Wisdom about kindness creates an inner drive to be kind
- Wisdom about justice creates an inner need to be fair
- Wisdom about truth creates natural honesty
- Each layer builds on and deepens the previous ones
This is why external moral rules often fail - they're not connected to personal wisdom. They're imposed rather than developed, universal rather than personal. Your dharma, on the other hand, is:
- Born from your own experience
- Connected to your actual wisdom
- Natural rather than imposed
- Perfectly tailored to your development
Ever feel uncomfortable about something even though it's "technically okay"? That's dharmic dissonance - when your actions don't align with your developed wisdom. It's not guilt about breaking rules or fear of punishment. It's a genuine inner knowing that you're acting below your level of understanding.
Once you get involved in energy work, you will know how dharmic dissonance can make people sick in soul energy, then it goes to brain-mind energy, then to spirit-energy and the body gets sick, and that creates other energy problems that again continue going round the cycle.
Being in the wrong job, or hanging with the wrong crowd, or not having a personal life philosophy that grounds you and you get swept up with popular narratives; those are the types of things that can cause dharmic dissonance and it will diminish your holistic wellbeing.
Observe how some people actually exhibit signs of going crazy, as they say, from dharmic dissonance. They feel the dissonance but don't have the substance to break away and stand up for themselves -- which in Wayism means to do the right thing for your soul-minds and spirit-minds.
Think about professional athletes. At a certain point, they don't need coaches telling them to train or eat right. They naturally do what their level of development requires. This is how dharma works - as you evolve, right action becomes increasingly natural.
Remember: As future divine beings, we're developing the natural dharma of divinity:
- Perfect ethics without effort
- Natural beneficence
- Spontaneous service
- Effortless right action
This isn't about becoming morally perfect - it's about evolving into beings whose nature is divine. Just as water naturally flows downhill, divine beings naturally express perfect ethics and compassion.
Here's the beautiful part: Your dharma can't be taught - it can only be developed through conscious living and genuine wisdom. Each experience, each reflection, each new understanding adds another layer to your natural sense of right action.
CHAPTER 30
## The Last Words
### A Promise, not Abandonment
One of the most poignant moments in the story of Lord Jesus comes at the end of his life on the cross. Christians have long taught devotees that Lord Jesus cried out in despair, "My God, why have you forsaken me?" This interpretation, based on what Roman soldiers thought they heard through Lord Jesus' parched lips, has shaped Christian theology profoundly, and it served Judaism well. But it presents us with a troubling contradiction - would the teacher who demonstrated divine wisdom throughout his life suddenly doubt everything at the end?
The truth is far more beautiful and consistent with Lord Jesus' life and teaching. His last words were spoken in Sanskrit, directed to Mari of Magadha, his closest disciple who had journeyed with him from India. "*Ehi elaya rame sabhāṃ ca atāni*" - "Come, be calm dear, I shall always wander amongst the assembly." These weren't words of despair, but of comfort and promise - assuring his beloved student that death of the body wouldn't end his presence among those who follow The Way.
## Mari of Magadha: From Slavery to Sainthood
The story of Mari illuminates the transformative power of Lord Jesus' teaching and his profound respect for all beings. He first encountered her as a child slave in a Kashmir brothel, where she served monks, priests, and government officials. In a society that saw such children as disposable, Lord Jesus saw a soul of immense potential.
This wasn't mere pity or charity. Lord Jesus recognized in Mari a capacity for spiritual understanding that transcended her circumstances. She was an old soul with well-developed spirit-minds and deep dharma. He didn't just rescue her - he educated her, trained her in energy healing, and helped her develop into one of the most profound teachers of The Way. She followed him and taught children and women from Kashmir to Galilee to Egypt and Ethiopia and Arabia and back to Kashmir again. There are Wayist books about Mother Mari's fascinating life, her poems, and teachings.
Here is one of Mother Mari of Magadha's poems:
#### **Lotus Rising**
> From mud-depths rising,
> Through waters ascending,
> To light transforming---
> This is the Way.
> In darkness binding,
> Through love transcending,
> To wisdom flowing---
> This is the Path.
> From death emerging,
> Through gates ascending,
> To heaven returning---
> This is our Truth.
Mari's journey from enslaved child to spiritual teacher demonstrates everything Lord Jesus taught about:
- The irrelevance of social status to spiritual potential
- The transformative power of divine love
- The reality that every soul can evolve to highest consciousness
- The truth that our current circumstances don't define our potential
Under Lord Jesus' guidance, Mari became:
- A master of energy healing
- A teacher of women
- A profound spiritual guide
- One of the most important preservers of Lord Jesus' authentic teaching
After Lord Jesus left his body, Mari continued teaching, eventually returning to Kashmir where she joined the community of Wayists as an elder still training the energy healing practices Lord Jesus had taught. Her life stands as testament to the truth that no soul is beyond reaching divine potential, no circumstance can permanently limit spiritual evolution.
## The Living Teaching
**These stories aren't just historical accounts - they're living teachings that show us**
- The power of seeing beyond current circumstances
- The reality of spiritual transformation
- The truth about human potential
- The ongoing presence of divine guidance
When Lord Jesus promised Mari he would "always wander amongst the assembly," he was describing a reality we can still experience today. His presence continues not as a distant deity to be worshipped, but as a living teacher whose wisdom remains accessible to all who walk The Way.
**This understanding transforms how we**
- View human potential
- Approach spiritual practice
- Relate to divine guidance
- Understand death and transformation
CHAPTER 31
## The Second Coming
### Already Here
Here's something that might surprise you: When Lord Jesus spoke about his return, he gave a very specific timeline - "within this generation" (which meant 40 years in his time). When his disciples pressed for details, he said it would happen after Jerusalem's Temple fell, comparing the event of his return to lightning that "strikes in the East and is seen in the West."
What actually happened? Exactly what he promised, though not in the way the later Christians expected.
Around 78 CE, approximately 40 years after Lord Jesus' crucifixion and 8 years after Rome destroyed Jerusalem's Temple and scattered Judaism, something extraordinary occurred in Kashmir. A spiritual revolution culminated that would transform Eastern spirituality and fulfil Lord Jesus' promise in ways far more profound than a physical return.
This wasn't about a body appearing in the clouds. Instead:
- Lord Buddha Gautama announced that Avalokiteshvara (Lord Jesus' Sanskrit title) would henceforth appear to seekers in whatever form they needed
- A massive reformation in Buddhism occurred, leading to what we now call Mahayana Buddhism, which incorporated many Wayist teachings
- The divine feminine was restored to its proper place in all religions (except Judaism)
- The role of the Taras - divine guides for all humanity - was formally established and the number of Taras increased
Mari of Magadha, by then an elderly woman, played a crucial role. Her profound understanding of both human nature and divine reality made her the perfect choice to help train new Taras - spiritual guides who would assist humanity's evolution. She was literally taken up into Heaven for this work, becoming one of the foremost trainers of divine guides.
Just as Lord Jesus predicted, while this lightning struck in the East, its light would be seen in the West. The teachings spread:
- West through the Silk Road's trade routes and East by shipping routes
- Into various cultures and traditions
- Through different spiritual expressions
- Influencing multiple wisdom streams
This understanding transforms how we see both Lord Jesus' promise and our current reality:
- We're not waiting for a future event
- We're living in the time of fulfilled promise
- The divine guidance he promised is already here
- The transformation he spoke of is ongoing
Lord Jesus didn't lie, he did return as he promised. The question isn't "When will Lord Jesus return?" as Christians ask, but "How do we engage with the spiritual presence and guidance that's already here?" We have:
- Direct access to divine guidance through our Taras
- Enhanced spiritual support for evolution
- Greater opportunities for transformation
- The fulfilled promise of divine presence
This isn't about anticipating an apocalyptic future. It's about recognizing and engaging with a spiritual reality that's already unfolding. Just as Lord Jesus said, "The kingdom of heaven is within you," the second coming isn't about waiting for something external - it's about awakening to what's already present.
Did you know that more than 2 billion people around the world are fondly aware of Avalokitesvara who also appears as the first or only female Buddha (Guanyin) and more?
## PART 3
### METAPHYSICAL ANATOMY
CHAPTER 32
## Understanding Your Ten Minds
Imagine having ten different processors working simultaneously, each specializing in different aspects of experience. That's exactly what you have:
### Three Body-Minds
- Brain-mind: Processes immediate physical reality, pattern recognition, some memory
- Organ-mind: Coordinates bodily functions, sensory, and instincts
- Microbiome-mind: Connected to gut feelings, hormones, endocrine system...
### Three Soul-Minds
- Muladhara: Handles survival, security, and group connection
- Svadhisthana: Processes creativity, sexuality, and personal expression
- Manipura: Manages personal power and self-definition
### Four Spirit-Minds
- Anahata: The heart-mind, bridge between soul and spirit
- Vishuddhi: Processes higher wisdom and spiritual communication
- Ajna: Develops spiritual insight and energy perception
- Sahasrara: Connects with divine consciousness
### These aren't just theoretical constructs
Each mind influences how you experience and interpret life. For example:
- When you get a "gut feeling," that's often your microbiome- mind and Manipura mind communicating
- When you feel deeply moved by beauty, that's usually Anahata at work
- When you have sudden spiritual insights, that's Vishuddhi processing
This system has been known and taught since ancient times. Lord Jesus worked with these different levels of consciousness, teaching people how to integrate and elevate them. The tragedy is that much of this practical wisdom was later replaced with simple doctrines about sin and salvation.
## The Living Tradition
This understanding hasn't been lost. It's been preserved and transmitted through various lineages, particularly in the East where many of Lord Jesus' original students traveled. The same energy practices he taught in Galilee were later integrated with Buddhist and Hindu traditions, enriching both.
In Kashmir, where Thomas Didymus established thriving Wayist communities because Lord Jesus sent him there from Galilee, he found how these teaching which the Lord taught there a few years ago, had merged with local wisdom traditions. Mari's work in Egypt, Aksum, and India helped establish training centers for energy healing and spiritual development. These weren't religious institutions -- they were practical schools for developing higher consciousness.
Today's Wayists continue these practices, adapted for modern life. We might use different terminology, but the essential techniques remain the same:
- Energy sensing and healing
- Working consciously with all ten minds
- Living fully while developing spiritually
- Maintaining direct connection with divine guidance
While religious tradition often divides sacred from mundane, the realized mystic sees divine reality permeating everything. Listen to how Janabai, a 13th-century housemaid turned mystic, expresses this profound understanding:
## There is nothing empty of divine
*What I eat is divine *
*What I drink is divine *
*My bed is also divine *
*The divine is here, and it is there *
*There is nothing empty of divine *
**
*Jani says -- Source has filled *
*everything from the inside out *
*-by Janabai*
This isn't poetic exaggeration. Like Lord Jesus celebrating life so fully his critics called him a 'glutton and wine-bibber,' Janabai recognized that every aspect of existence is sacred when we see it clearly and we see it clearly not with eyes in the head but the eyes of all our minds.
In the following two chapters we will explore this topic and go a little deeper. It is worth it to have a solid understanding of our metaphysical anatomy because we use these parts of self all day every day.
CHAPTER 33
## Your Inner Symphony
### Orchestrating your Ten Minds
Instead of having just one mind, you're actually running the most sophisticated network of mind processors in known existence. Each generates an energetic field according to its workings and sophistication, which we call an aura. The combined total of all ten auras create your energetic body field, your aura. This is what the deities see when they look at us -- the temporary organic body we wear at the moment has no significance to them.
In the Gospel of Thomas, Saying 37 describes a conversation between Lord Jesus and some disciples when he greeted them to depart elsewhere. The disciples ask the Lord when he will appear to them again and when they will see him. Lord Jesus responds by saying, "When you strip naked without shame and trample your clothing underfoot just as little children do."
There are two things we should take away from this saying. The innocence of little children (we must get that back and hold on to it) who know that a naked body is just a body and is natural and there is no reason whatsoever for shame -- and the clothing is just what the actor wears to depict the character it plays on their stage. Secondly, what truly matters is who we are, authentically who we are -- we are energy beings and when deities look at us we stand naked in front of them because they don't see or look at or care about the organic body that we wear. Our body to them is like an ever changing, ever aging, duffel coat we will soon throw out. But we, we are not that old coat, of course.
Once you understand how this incredible system works in your daily life, life becomes so much more meaningful and benign.
Think of yourself like a divine supercomputer in training (wearing an old duffel coat), with ten different processors each specializing in different aspects of existence. Let's see how they work in real-life situations, listing a simplified version of faculties:
### Your Body-Mind Team (Your Temporary Operating System)
Brain-mind: Your everyday conscious processor
- Analyzes your morning emails
- Performs pattern recognition
- Handles practical decisions
- Processes immediate information
- Memory functions, muscle and speech memory
Organ-mind: Your body's collective intelligence
- Signals hunger at lunchtime
- Alerts you to rest when tired
- Coordinates physical responses
- Manages bodily functions and chemistry
Microbiome-mind: Your gut-level awareness
- Gives you "gut feelings" about dietary needs and toxins and goodness in foods and environment.
- Influences your moods and cravings
- Contributes to intuitive decisions
- Affects your hormone and energy levels
### Your Soul-Mind Trio (Your Core System)
Muladhara: Your foundation, survival and security processor
- Concerns itself with financial security
- Monitors group acceptance
- Focuses on physical safety
- Maintains cultural connections
Svadhisthana: Your ego, creativity and desire center
- Drives personal expression
- Generates creative ideas
- Seeks sensuous experiences
vCreates your unique style and sense of self
Manipura: Your personal power and soul manager
- Makes strategic soul decisions
- Handles soul leadership situations
- Manages soul relationships
- Controls soul energy distribution
### Your Spirit-Mind Quartet (Your Emerging Divine Network)
Anahata: Your heart-center bridge
- Feels compassion for others
- Connects with divine love
- Guides ethical decisions
- Provides deeper understanding
Vishuddhi: Your wisdom transformer
- Extracts lessons from experience
- Develops deeper understanding
- Communicates spiritual truth
- Processes higher knowledge
Ajna: Your spiritual insight processor
- Senses subtle energies
- Provides intuitive guidance
- Perceives spiritual reality
- Connects with higher wisdom
Sahasrara: Your divine connection center
- Maintains heavenly connection
- Coordinates spiritual growth
- Aligns with divine purpose
- Guides ultimate transformation
Real-Life Application:
Let's see how this plays out in a common situation - deciding whether to take a new job:
Body-Mind Team processes:
- Brain-mind analyzes salary and benefits
- Organ-mind signals stress or excitement
- Microbiome-mind gives gut instincts
Soul-Mind Trio evaluates:
- Muladhara assesses security aspects
- Svadhisthana explores creative opportunities
- Manipura weighs power dynamics
Spirit-Mind Quartet provides:
- Anahata offers heart wisdom
- Vishuddhi seeks deeper meaning
- Ajna provides spiritual insight
- Sahasrara aligns with divine purpose
Understanding this system explains those times when:
- Different parts of you want different things
- You know something mentally but feel differently emotionally
- You sense something spiritually but can't explain it logically
- You're pulled between higher and lower impulses
### Working with All Ten Minds
For Better Decisions:
- Check in with all levels
- Allow each mind to contribute
- Balance different perspectives
- Align with highest wisdom
For Relationships:
- Notice which minds are engaging
- Balance different levels of connection
- Understand others' mind patterns
- Create deeper harmony
For Spiritual Growth:
- Develop all ten minds
- Balance their input
- Align their purposes
- Work toward integration
Remember: You're not trying to silence any mind or elevate one over others. You're learning to work with your complete divine technology. It's like learning to conduct an orchestra - every instrument has its place in creating the full symphony of conscious evolution.
The beauty is that with practice, this coordination becomes more natural. Just as a conductor develops an intuitive feel for their orchestra, you'll develop natural skill in working with all your minds. This is essential training for your future as a divine being - learning to work harmoniously with multiple levels of consciousness and energy.
CHAPTER 34
## Living with All Ten Minds
### Practical wisdom for today
Now that you understand your ten-mind system, let's see take a final look at how this plays out in everyday modern life. Remember, rather than trying to "manage" these minds, think of yourself as a conductor learning to create harmony from different instruments.
**Let's start with something simple - your morning coffee or tea**.
Most people experience this only through brain-mind - just a caffeine delivery system. But watch what happens when you engage all levels:
### Your Body-Mind Team
- Brain-mind appreciates the aroma and warmth
- Organ-mind responds to the nourishment
- Microbiome-mind signals whether this serves your system
### Your Soul-Mind Trio
- Muladhara enjoys the security of morning routine
- Svadhisthana delights in the sensory experience
- Manipura makes choices about quality and preparation
### Your Spirit-Mind Quartet
- Anahata feels gratitude for this moment
- Vishuddhi reflects on the interconnections that brought this drink to you
- Ajna senses the energy quality
- Sahasrara connects this simple act to your larger spiritual journey
## Now let's apply this to a modern work challenge
**Dealing with a difficult colleague. Instead of just reacting, notice how your minds engage**
### Body-Mind Team
- Brain-mind analyzes the situation
- Organ-mind registers stress responses
- Microbiome-mind signals fight-or-flight impulses
### Soul-Mind Trio
- Muladhara assesses threat levels
- Svadhisthana wants emotional expression
- Manipura strategizes power dynamics
### Spirit-Mind Quartet
- Anahata offers compassionate perspective
- Vishuddhi seeks deeper understanding
- Ajna perceives underlying energies
- Sahasrara aligns response with higher purpose
## Even something as modern as social media engagement involves all ten minds
### Body-Mind Team
- Brain-mind processes information
- Organ-mind responds to emotional triggers
- Microbiome-mind signals authenticity or danger
### Soul-Mind Trio
- Muladhara reacts to perceived threats or support
- Svadhisthana seeks expression and connection
- Manipura manages your public image
### Spirit-Mind Quartet
- Anahata maintains compassionate awareness
- Vishuddhi discerns truth from manipulation
- Ajna senses energy behind messages
- Sahasrara keeps you aligned with higher purpose
## Financial decisions beautifully demonstrate this system at work
### Body-Mind Team
- Brain-mind calculates numbers
- Organ-mind registers security feelings
- Microbiome-mind gives instinctive signals
### Soul-Mind Trio
- Muladhara focuses on security needs
- Svadhisthana dreams of possibilities
- Manipura weighs control issues
#### Spirit-Mind Quartet
- Anahata considers impact on others
- Vishuddhi seeks deeper wisdom
- Ajna perceives spiritual implications
- Sahasrara aligns choices with divine purpose
## The key isn't to override any mind but to create harmony. Like a good conductor
- You honor each instrument's voice
- You help them work together
- You create something greater than the sum of parts
- You maintain overall harmony while allowing individual expression
## This understanding transforms daily life into spiritual practice
- Every challenge becomes an opportunity for integration
- Each decision becomes practice in mind coordination
- All experiences offer chances for greater harmony
- Every moment can engage your full divine technology
Remember: You're not trying to silence the "lower" minds or only listen to the "higher" ones. You're learning to work with your complete system. This is what Lord Jesus demonstrated - perfect integration of all levels while maintaining divine consciousness.
The beauty is that with practice, this coordination becomes more natural. Just as a conductor develops an intuitive feel for their orchestra, you'll develop natural skill in working with all your minds. This is essential training for your future as a divine being - learning to work harmoniously with multiple levels of consciousness and energy.
CHAPTER 35
## From Soul-Being to Spirit-Being
### The practical Path
Let's address something that puzzles many spiritual seekers: If we're evolving into divine beings, why does life often feel so... un-divine? Why is it that the Abrahamic religions who pretend to be so holy are the world's worst human rights offenders, instructed by their God to invade countries, decimate their livelihoods and steal their resources, impoverish and break down all that was good? How is that holy?
Understanding this helps us work more effectively with our own development.
## The Reality of Being Hybrid
Here's what makes humans unique: We're hybrid beings, part soul and part developing spirit. Picture a caterpillar that's already growing butterfly wings inside its body and has all potential to change into a new kind of being. That's us -- soul beings with sprouting spirit consciousness.
This hybrid nature creates some interesting situations:
- Our soul-minds want security and express its sense of self (ego), while our spirit-minds seek growth and know we are developing into another type of being, we don't yet have a true sense of self.
- Our soul consciousness craves certainty, winning and dominance, while spirit thrives in mystery
- Our soul nature competes, while spirit naturally cooperates and sees value in greys between extremes
- Soul-minds are selfish and hoard, spirit-minds naturally share
This isn't a battle between good and evil -- it's the natural tension of evolution. The soul isn't bad; it's just being what it is. The key is learning to work with both aspects of our nature while developing the higher.
## Three Stages of Development
Lord Jesus often spoke of different levels of understanding. He would say to some, "You cannot understand these things because I speak to spirit-people." Let's break down these stages:
**1. Soul-People (Psychekoi)**
- Primary focus on survival and material success as measured by that culture
- Motivated by personal gain
- See spirituality as a means to an end
- Need religious rules and structure
- Need fear of a wrathful God or catastrophic outcome in the hereafter for 'sinners', and a way to be saved from the outcome.
**2. Awakening Ones**
- Beginning to sense something more
- Experiencing inner conflict
- Questioning established patterns
- Sensing divine potential
- Beginning to see soul-people as a different grade of student
- Beginning to see through the ruse of cultural elevation of scholars, elected officials, scientists, and people in power
- Beginning to distrust all seemingly "good causes" and justifications for wars
**3. Spirit-People (Pneumatikoi)**
- Growing in divine awareness
- Naturally embodying higher qualities
- Understanding through direct perception
- Living from spirit consciousness while honoring necessary soul needs, gradually santifying the soul as a caterpillar is dissolved and rebuilt into a new being
## The Practical Process
How does this transformation actually happen? Through:
**Conscious Energy Work**
- Learning to sense and direct spiritual energies
- Developing higher frequency awareness
- Transforming lower energies into higher ones
- Working with our Divine Tara for guidance
**Natural Development**
- Living fully and sensuously
- Learning from all experiences
- Developing all ten minds
- Growing through relationships and challenges
**Intentional Practice**
- Regular meditation, contemplation, and energy work
- Conscious attitude management
- Service to others
- Direct communion with divine guides and regular togetherness
## The Challenge and Beauty of Our Time
**We live in an age where**
- Soul consciousness dominates global culture
- Material success is worshipped
- Competition is celebrated
- Surface appearances matter more than depth
- Otherness and division is engineered and embraced
Yet this very environment provides perfect conditions for spiritual evolution. Every challenge to our developing spirit consciousness is an opportunity for growth.
**Think about it**
- When materialism surrounds us, we develop stronger spiritual discernment
- When surface values dominate, we learn to value depth
- When competition rules, we discover the power of cooperation
- When chaos swirls, we find our inner stability
## The Joy of Conscious Evolution
This isn't a grim process of denying our humanity. Remember, Lord Jesus was criticized for enjoying life too much! (he made more wine for the party, and Peter complained that he kissed Mari differently, remember?) It's about:
- Living more fully, not less
- Experiencing everything more deeply
- Finding joy in transformation
- Celebrating each step of growth
When Lord Jesus said "I came that they might have life more abundantly," he wasn't promising material prosperity. He was pointing to this fuller way of being -- alive to all dimensions of existence, holistic abundance and success and wealth, while evolving toward our highest potential.
CHAPTER 36
## The Living Presence
### Your Divine Guide
When Lord Jesus promised, "I will ask the Father to send holy spirits as divine guides" to humanity, he wasn't talking about distant supernatural beings. He was describing an intimate spiritual relationship that transforms how we experience life itself. Let's explore this profound dimension of the path.
## First of all, "How does one address one's Tara?"
The short answer is, personally, I pray to the Lord and sometimes I have Lord Jesus in mind when I pray but I know his answering service will send it to my Tara because that's just how heaven works. And, to insist you want to speak to the CEO right now, right here, about your issue ( ;-)) will result in Lord Jesus having to put you on hold to go find your Tara because they know your situation best and knows exactly what you need. No matter what "name" you use, as long as you are attuned to the spiritual (not soul) energy channel you will always be speaking to your Divine Guide -- the holy spirit Lord Jesus spoke of.

This means anyone anywhere in the world, in any language, any culture, any religion, whenever they call on heavenly guidance or comfort and they are spiritually attuned, they connect with their Tara.
And what if you cannot speak? Like a baby in a womb, a person under anesthesia, or coma, a dying person or a brain damaged person -- its not our brains or words that connect -- its our higher-self chakras, its the Heart mind and Vishuddhi mind that connect with Tara.
Human language fail us. In English-language we show more reverse to a magistrate or judge, calling the My Lord, the British have a House of Lords who are people blessed by the Royal sword as Lords. And then they go about calling Lord Jesus by his first name (they don't even know his last name) and they also invoke the Lord's name in vain, wine, and disdain. In Spanish the Latin peoples can name a child Jesus. They address the Lord Jesus as Señor Jesus, but Jesus Fernades the plumber's dad is also named Jesus so we address him as Señor Jesus.
For the Wayist, the emphasis is not on the words spoken but where the connection is sought. We can only connect with holiness in our higher self vibrations, our higher-self minds and then no matter what words we use, our awe, sacredness, intention, and attitude determines whether or not we will connect.
## The Nature of Mystic Communion
This relationship isn't about formal prayer or ritual. It's more like:
- A deep kinship that transcends words
- An inner knowing that grows clearer with practice
- A living presence in your daily experience
- A source of wisdom that speaks through intuition and insight
- A trusted presence of divine energy as holy companion
You might experience your Tara's presence as:
- A sudden clarity about a situation
- A feeling of being guided or protected
- An unexpected insight that changes everything
- A sense of divine presence in meditation
- A deep knowing that transcends rational thought
## From Prayer to Presence
Instead of petitioning a distant god, try:
- Opening to the guidance already present
- Listening with your heart rather than your mind
- Trusting your deeper intuitions
- Engaging in direct spiritual dialogue
This isn't about getting messages or predictions. Please don't be New Agey about this (they channel soul beings, not their spiritual guides). It's about:
- Developing spiritual discernment
- Learning to recognize divine guidance
- Growing in wisdom through relationship
- Experiencing direct spiritual communion
## The Dance of Divine Guidance
It's a skill you develop over time. So keep on practicing and you discover higher levels. Your Tara knows:
- When to guide explicitly
- When to let you discover for yourself
- How to turn every experience into wisdom
- What you need for your next step of growth
This relationship deepens naturally as you:
- Pay attention to subtle guidance
- Act on spiritual intuitions
- Reflect on experiences
- Develop trust in the process
## Practical Mysticism
You can cultivate this relationship through:
### Quiet Time
- Regular meditation
- Conscious breathing
- Inner listening
- Energy awareness
### Daily Life
- Checking in throughout the day
- Asking for guidance in decisions
- Expressing gratitude for insights
- Noticing synchronicities as learning how things work
### Deeper Practice
- Energy work with your Tara
- Dream awareness and management
- Mystical communion
- Wisdom reflection
## Growing in Wisdom
Each interaction with your Divine Tara generates wisdom and a friendship (not between equals) intensifies:
- Insights that change your perspective
- Understanding that transforms challenges
- Knowledge that becomes part of your being
- Growth that happens naturally and joyfully
This is the mystical heart of the path - not worship of the distant, but communion with the intimately present. It's what Lord Jesus meant when he said the kingdom of heaven is within you.
## Paradise coming and going
At the time of death of the human body or when the body is not viable any more, the soul is ready to go to Paradise and its Tara will be there to walk up that path with you to that light. It is a path the two of you have walked many times, in coming and in going. The body dying and walking with Tara to Paradise is a pleasure, and is easier than incarnating.
Incarnation happens at approximately 20 to 24 weeks and its a laborious process for the soul. It is followed by yet another birth, childhood, a new brain-mind that needs language and culture programming, and learning to walk -- a new family. Coming in is harder than going out. Without one's Tara by one's side it would have been much harder.
It is when the new brain-mind kicks in and the soul's ego (Svadhisthana mind) takes precedence when the fun of being human again starts and at that time the awareness of Tara fades for most people -- but not so much for older souls. Then comes life and survival and for some unnecessary reason at that time when we need Tara most we tend to ignore the sacred or embrace the religion of our culture -- and it may take years to get back to conscious cognitive awareness of Tara again.
When we are matured in theWAY and ready to graduate, we will walk with our Tara to Paradise after the last human lifetime and from there Tara will take us to be reborn in heaven -- when the butterfly opens its fledgling wings for the first time and soars into heaven. We are juvenile in Heaven and will sit at the feet of the perfected ones -- call them gods, buddhas, angels, whatever -- and we will be accepted as new immortal members of the Holy Family and be trained to become spiritual energy workers, helpers for other beings in our galaxy.
CHAPTER 37
## Energy Work
### Your future professional skills
Picture a surgeon washing their hands before an operation. They're not performing a ritual - they're practicing essential professional hygiene. Similarly, when Lord Jesus spent most of his time teaching energy healing, he wasn't performing mystical miracles - he was demonstrating and teaching professional skills we'll all need as future cosmic healers. Remember from the stories of Lord Jesus in Galilee about the washing of feet, the oil on the head, the spit and clay on the eyes and so many other likewise incidents in the so-called apocryphal books? All of it was energy healing work.
Think about it: If you're training to become a divine being who'll work with cosmic energies to help soul beings, wouldn't it make sense to start developing those abilities now, while living among soul beings and feeling what soul beings feel? That's exactly what Lord Jesus was doing - running the most sophisticated professional training program in history.
Here's what most people miss: Everything is energy. Your thoughts, emotions, physical body, relationships, even your spiritual essence - all are different forms of energy interacting in intricate ways. Learning to work with energy isn't some mystical sideshow - it's like a medical student learning anatomy. It's fundamental to your future profession.
Start with something simple: You have an energy sensor in the palm of each hand (and several other you will learn about as a Wayism). Find a willing subject or tie your unwilling spouse to a bed -- ground yourself, pray and enter your higher-self awareness. If the spouse makes noises put a sock in it. Pray for the Lord (it will your divine guide who answers the call no matter what name you use) to sensitise and show you. Move your hand over your now willing accomplice's body. Feel for changes. Some people feel changes like pressure, or density, temperature, tingling -- were all different. Practise. Soon you will sense the 7 subtle minds, soul minds and spirit minds. This isn't magical thinking - it's developing basic professional sensitivity. Just as doctors learn to feel subtle differences in tissue that most people would miss, we're learning to sense energy variations that most people overlook.
Your most powerful energy tool is something you use constantly but probably haven't recognized: attitude. Like adjusting a radio dial, your attitude instantly shifts your personal energy frequency. This isn't positive thinking - it's practical energy management. Lord Jesus emphasized this repeatedly because it's a fundamental professional skill.
Consider how this plays out in daily life. When you walk into a room and immediately sense the "atmosphere," that's your natural energy sensitivity at work. When you feel drained after being with certain people, that's energy awareness trying to get your attention. These aren't coincidences or imagination - they're your innate professional capacities beginning to awaken.
As you develop, you'll learn to:
- Sense different types of energy clearly
- Clear negative energy accumulations effectively
- Channel healing energies skillfully
- Maintain healthy energy boundaries naturally and create energy shields
- Work with cosmic forces consciously
It's about developing the practical skills you'll use eternally as a divine being. Think of it like medical residency for cosmic healers - every experience, every practice session, builds your professional capacity.
Remember: You're not trying to gain supernatural powers. You're developing natural abilities that are already part of your divine heritage. Just as a baby bird already has everything needed for flight but must develop its wings, you have everything needed for energy work but must develop your abilities through practice.
Your Divine Tara guides this development perfectly, like a master surgeon training a resident. They know exactly:
- What skills you need to develop
- When you're ready for new challenges
- How to help you progress safely
- Where you need more practice
Most importantly, understand that energy work isn't separate from daily life. Every interaction, every situation, every challenge becomes an opportunity for professional development. This is why Lord Jesus demonstrated healing everywhere he went - he was showing how natural and normal these abilities should be.
The beauty is that as you develop these skills, you naturally become more:
- Aware of subtle realities
- Effective in helping others
- Clear in your perceptions
- Skillful in your actions
- Professional in your service
This is what Lord Jesus meant when he said his followers would do greater things than he did. He wasn't setting himself up as an unreachable ideal but demonstrating abilities we're all meant to develop.
The Lord said in Apocrypha 9:11, "Remind ye the brain-mind to untie thy spouse afore ye read on."
CHAPTER 38
## Working with Energy
### Your daily divine practice
Think about how a doctor learns to feel subtle differences in tissue that most people would never notice. Or how a master chef can taste nuances in food that others miss entirely. That's exactly what we're doing when we develop energy awareness - it's not mystical, it's professional development.
Let's start with something you already know but might not recognize. Have you ever:
- Walked into a room and immediately felt the "atmosphere"?
- Known someone was staring at you without seeing them?
- Felt drained after being with certain people?
- Been energized by specific places or activities?
- Sensed someone's mood without a word being spoken?
- Held something in your hand and you just knew it not good or you sense goodness?
That's your natural energy sensitivity at work. It's not supernatural - it's a basic professional capacity you're already equipped with. Lord Jesus spent much of his time teaching people to develop these abilities not because they're magical, but because they're essential skills for our future work as divine beings.
Let's practice with something simple: Your next meal. Before eating or while cooking:
- Hold your hands over the food
- Pay attention to what you sense
- Notice if your hands feel warmth, tingling, or other sensations and what does it tell you
- Trust your initial impressions
- Notice how different foods feel different
- Feel the difference between one of those packaged long life pizzas or a mass market bread bun and something from the farmers' market.
This isn't about becoming a food mystic - it's about developing basic professional sensitivity. Just as medical students learn anatomy, we're learning to sense the energy anatomy of our world.
## Your Most Powerful Tool: Attitude
Think of attitude as your personal energy management system. Its one of the only things in life over which you have full control:
- It instantly shifts your energy frequency
- This affects your entire energy field
- Which influences your environment
- Which influences your brain-mind and body senses
- Which impacts everyone around you
That's why Lord Jesus emphasized attitude over rules - it's a fundamental professional skill.
## Daily Life Applications

- Energy sensing
- Conscious transformation
- Skillful sharing
- Professional development
- Divine service
CHAPTER 39
## Sacred Sensuousness
### Living fully in a divine body
Here's something most religions won't tell you: We're incarnated in one of the most sensuous organic bodies in our galaxy - and that's by divine design. This isn't an accident or a test of resistance to pleasure. It's curriculum. Every sensation, every pleasure, every sensuous experience is an opportunity for spiritual development.
**Think about the incredible sensory equipment you're working with**
- Eyes that can distinguish millions of colors
- Ears that can detect subtle variations in sound
- Skin that can feel the lightest touch
- A nervous system that can register profound pleasure
- Senses that work together to create rich experiences
- Soul-minds and spirit-minds that each sense energies of others
**Yet religious tradition often teaches us to**
- Fear bodily pleasure
- Suppress sensuous experience
- Divide spirit from flesh
- See the body as a trap or test
**Lord Jesus demonstrated something radically different. He lived fully, he**
- Enjoyed festive celebrations
- Shared sensuous meals with friends
- Appreciated physical beauty
- Lived fully in his body
- Taught through sensory experience
This is why his critics called him a "glutton and wine-bibber" - he embraced life's sensuous aspects rather than rejecting them. He understood something profound: Our human form, with its incredible capacity for pleasure, pain, and every sensation in between, is a perfect vehicle for spiritual evolution.
**Consider how this plays out in daily life**.
When you eat mindfully, you're not just satisfying hunger - you're:
- Practicing energy awareness
- Developing gratitude
- Experiencing interconnection
- Cultivating presence
- Engaging in spiritual practice
This truth about divine presence everywhere isn't just poetic theory. Mystics across time have discovered it through direct experience. Consider how Rabia, a Muslim mystic from the 8th century, expresses this reality:
## In My Spirit
*In my spirit *
*there is a temple, a shrine, a mosque, a church *
*where I kneel. *
*Prayer should bring us to an altar where no walls or names exist. *
*Is there not a region of love where the sovereignty is *
*illumined *
*The nothing where ecstasy gets poured into itself *
*and becomes lost, *
*where the butterfly is fully alive *
*but has no mind or body? *
*In my spirit *
*there is a temple, a shrine, a mosque, a church *
*that dissolve, that dissolve in God. *
*-- Rabia al Basri*
Rabia is not speaking metaphorically. Like Lord Jesus taught, she discovered that divine connection needs no special buildings or religious forms. Every moment, every place, can be sacred when we recognize the divine presence that's always here. When we that awe of the immensity of The Way in which we live, the presence of Divine energies in all things -- we feel the presence of The Absolute. When we tear up because we just realized an animal or plant exhibited intellect or emotion we never before knew to exist, we are sensing the sacred in life all around us.
**Every sensory experience becomes an opportunity for spiritual development**
- The warmth of sunlight on your skin
- The taste of fresh fruit
- The scent of rain on warm earth
- The sound of wind in trees
- The sight of a starlit sky
- Making love and feeling loved
- When our energies are attuned, during orgasm we sense heaven within
- The evening breeze on the porch with home brewed coffee or a natural wine
- Watching young people blossom and posture their newfound sensuousness, testing their attraction skills---the magnificent hormonal cycle of making human communities and mating that leads to partnership, building a life together, raising family and growing old together
**Each sensation can be**
- A moment of pure presence
- A gateway to divine awareness
- A lesson in being fully alive
- An opportunity for spiritual perception
**This understanding transforms how we live**
- Eating becomes communion
- Bathing becomes purification
- Walking becomes meditation
- Breathing becomes prayer
- Living becomes worship
- Natural herbs and spices and cooking like incense in a temple
- Tastes, textures. scents, raise us to touch heaven
- Feet in soil, grass and beach, touching Earth, sensory healing
- Feeling, sensing a loved one skin, energy, lips, heavenly
**So you know: Sacred sensuousness isn't about hedonism. It's about**
- Developing fuller awareness
- Experiencing life's divine dimension
- Opening all channels of perception
- Living authentically and deeply
Think of your body as a finely tuned instrument for experiencing divine reality. Every sense, every capacity for pleasure, every ability to feel and perceive is part of your spiritual technology. When Lord Jesus said "The kingdom of heaven is within you," he was pointing to this truth - that divine reality can be experienced right here, through this sensuous human form.
**The practice of sacred sensuousness means**
- Being fully present to each experience
- Appreciating sensory richness
- Understanding pleasure's purpose
- Living without shame or fear
- Engaging life completely
CHAPTER 40
## Sacred Partnerships
### Beyond romance to divine balance
Think about how our Heaven operates: God our Father and God our Mother work in perfect harmony, each bringing unique energies and qualities to create a balanced whole. This isn't just the most natural cosmic organization - it's also a template for human relationships that Lord Jesus understood and taught.
Let's explore what this means for creating conscious partnerships in today's world.
### Beyond Religious Rules
Forget everything religion has told you about relationships:
- Rigid gender roles that restrict growth
- Rules based on ancient cultural norms
- Power structures that create imbalance
- Obligations that stifle authentic connection
Instead, consider these eternal principles:
- Balance of Yin and Yang energies, each bring what they're best at
- Mutual support for spiritual growth
- Authentic respect and loving-kindness
- Natural expression of complementary qualities
### The Divine Template
Look at how our Divine Parents operate:
- Neither dominates the other
- Each brings unique strengths
- Both serve the greater good
- Together they create perfect balance
- Their union serves all beings
### This shows us that true partnership isn't about
- One person controlling another
- Fixed roles based on gender
- Power struggles or dominance
- Meeting society's expectations
- Playing socially prescribed parts
It's about:
- Natural energy balance
- Mutual spiritual support
- Authentic complementary expression
- Shared service to life's purpose
- Growth through relationship
### Creating Sacred Partnership
**Before seeking partnership, develop**
- Self-understanding
- Personal stability
- Clear purpose
- Emotional maturity
- Spiritual awareness
- Decide on a partnership model (mono, poly, civil partnership contract, whatever)
**Look for someone who**
- Complements your energies
- Shares your core values
- Supports spiritual growth
- Practices authentic respect
- Lives with conscious purpose
**Red flags to watch for**
- Attempts to control or dominate (it may not be true but if you perceive it that way, its a red flag for you)
- Disrespect for boundaries (it may not be true but if you perceive it that way, its a red flag for you)
- Resistance to personal growth (your partner is however not your project (ladies, Im talking to you!) to fix or shape)
- Inability to practice loving-kindness
- Lack of self-awareness
- Does not treat all other with respect
- Does not have self-discipline and self-respect
- Does not even try to own their own mind and is prone to go along with popular narratives
### Living the Balance
In daily life, this means:
- Respecting each other's nature
- Supporting mutual growth
- Practicing loving-kindness
- Maintaining healthy boundaries
- Serving life's purpose together
Practical aspects include:
- Open communication about needs
- Shared spiritual practice
- Mutual support for evolution
- Conscious handling of challenges
- Regular energy alignment
Remember: Marriage in Wayist understanding isn't about:
- Religious obligation
- Social convention
- Economic convenience
- Emotional dependency
- Cultural expectations
It's about:
- Creating divine balance
- Supporting mutual evolution
- Serving life's purpose
- Practicing conscious love
- Growing together spiritually
### The Role of Humility
True partnership requires:
- Knowing your strengths and limitations
- Respecting complementary qualities
- Setting aside ego for harmony
- Learning from each other
- Growing through challenges
### Simplicity in Relationship
Practice:
- Clear communication
- Straightforward dealing
- Authentic expression
- Natural harmony
- Uncluttered connection
### The Power of Loving-Kindness
Express through:
- Conscious support
- Gentle understanding
- Practical help
- Patient growth
- Wise compassion
### Modern Application
In today's world, this means:
- Both partners may work outside home
- Roles flex based on capability not gender
- Decisions made through wisdom not power
- Resources shared with conscious purpose
- Growth supported mutually
Questions for Potential Partners:
- How do we complement each other energetically?
- Do we support each other's spiritual growth?
- Can we practice authentic respect consistently?
- Are we aligned in life's purpose?
- Do we balance each other naturally?
Remember: The goal isn't finding a perfect person, but creating perfect balance together. Like our Divine Parents, each partner brings unique qualities that, when combined with wisdom and respect, create something greater than either alone.
This is the art of sacred partnership - not following rules or roles, but creating divine harmony through conscious relationship. It's about two people supporting each other's evolution while serving life's greater purpose together."
## Relationships: Beyond Religious Rules
While Christianity focuses on moral rules, sexual restrictions, and religious obligations in relationships, Lord Jesus taught something far more profound - how to engage in authentic relationships that serve spiritual evolution. This wasn't about following religious laws but about genuine soul connection and mutual growth.
### Beyond Religious Morality
Christianity emphasizes:
- Moral restrictions
- Marriage rules
- Gender roles
- Sexual limitations
- Religious obligations
Wayist approach involves:
- Authentic connection
- Mutual growth support
- Natural relationships
- Energy awareness
- Conscious evolution
### Understanding Soul Connections
Unlike religious views of relationships, we recognize:
- Past life connections
- Soul mate resonance
- Karmic partnerships
- Growth opportunities
- Divine purpose
## Different Types of Relationships
We understand:
- Soul partnerships
- Growth catalysts
- Karmic teachers
- Spirit companions
- Divine guides
Each serves evolution differently.
### Sacred Sexuality
Instead of religious fear of sexuality:
- Energy awareness in intimacy
- Conscious connection
- Sacred sensuousness
- Natural expression
- Divine communion
### Professional Perspective
Remember: As future divine beings:
- All relationships are temporary
- All serve evolutionary purpose
- All offer growth opportunities
-All develop professional skills
### Navigating Challenges
Beyond moral rules:
- Energy awareness in conflicts
- Karmic understanding
- Growth focus
- Conscious choice
- Professional development
### Signs of Development
You're progressing when:
- Relationships become more conscious
- Connections deepen naturally
- Growth accelerates mutually
- Service flows spontaneously
- Divine love emerges
### Common Pitfalls
Watch for:
- Religious guilt
- Moral judgments
- Relationship addiction
- Growth avoidance
- Karmic interference
- A burning need to give a pastor a lot of money. When this happens, donate to Wayist.Life or, preferably, the author who used to be a pastor ;-)
### The Balance
Maintaining:
- Personal evolution
- Mutual support
- Professional development
- Natural connection
- Divine awareness
### Living It
Daily practice:
1. Conscious connection
2. Energy awareness
3. Growth focus
4. Natural service
5. Professional development
### The Promise
As you develop:
- Relationships become clearer
- Connections deepen
- Growth accelerates
- Love expands
- Service flows
Unlike Judeo-Christian emphasis on moral behavior (even though people just ignore it for most even though its the Word of their God), Wayist relationships focus on conscious evolution and mutual growth. Every relationship becomes an opportunity for spiritual development and professional training.
### Breaking Free
Moving beyond:
- Religious guilt about pleasure, joy, and awe
- Moral rules about connection
- Gender role limitations
- Sexual and sensuous fear and shame
- Relationship dogma
### The Higher Purpose
Relationships serve:
- Mutual evolution
- Spiritual growth
- Professional development
- Divine awakening
- Universal service
Remember: You're not following religious rules - you're developing the consciousness and capabilities needed for divine service. Every relationship is an opportunity for growth toward that goal.
CHAPTER 41
## Navigating Karma
### Beyond reward and punishment
Think of karma as the world's most sophisticated educational algorithm - constantly analyzing your needs, crafting perfect learning opportunities, and adjusting your life experiences to support your evolution. This metaphysical Law can almost be said to "want" you to graduate.This isn't about cosmic punishment or reward. It's about perfect educational design.
### Forget everything you've heard about karma as
- Divine punishment for past wrongs
- Cosmic revenge for bad behavior
- Some kind of spiritual accounting system
- The universe 'getting back at you'
- A system of moral payback
### Instead, understand karma as
- Your personalized curriculum
- Your perfect learning program
- Your cosmic educational plan
- Your evolutionary roadmap
It's like having the most advanced AI teaching system imaginable, one that knows:
- Exactly what experiences you need
- Precisely when you need them
- The perfect form to deliver them
- The ideal timing for your growth
Think about it: Would any decent teacher punish a student for not knowing something they haven't learned yet? Or reward them simply for knowing what they should? Real education is about providing the right experiences at the right time for optimal learning. That's exactly how Law of Karma works.
Your incarnation circumstances offer:
- Custom-designed lessons
- Perfect growth opportunities
- Tailored learning experiences
- Exact matches for your needs
While not everything that happens is because of Karma - everything serves learning. That difficult person in your life? They might be providing exactly the challenge you need to develop patience -- so learn, become a better person, then move on. That unexpected setback? Perhaps it's creating space for something better. That recurring pattern in relationships? Likely a lesson you haven't fully grasped yet.
This understanding transforms how you view challenges:
- Financial struggles become lessons in value and trust
- Relationship difficulties become courses in love and boundaries
- Health issues become teachings about balance and care
- Career challenges become training in purpose and persistence
### Common Misunderstandings
Karma isn't about:
- Getting what you deserve
- Paying for past mistakes
- Earning future rewards
- Balancing cosmic books
It's about receiving exactly what you need for evolution. Sometimes that means challenges that strengthen you. Sometimes it means successes that teach you to handle prosperity. Always it means perfect educational design.
But if you want to muse a sense of justice, and you should not, because Lord Jesus said we shouldn't, and he said it because he knew we will do it, you can think about how many lifetimes in war zones, famine, oppression, abuse, and violence Karma must dish up to wealthy individuals in our society today who participate in inflicting masses of people with designed viruses and the social and political tyranny that goes with it. A person so deluded by greed and abuse of power has a very long karmic road ahead to one day reach the level of spiritual development that you have.
### Working With Karma
Smart approaches include:
- Learning from everything
- Accepting what comes while growing through it
- Understanding each experience's purpose
- Trusting the educational process
### What doesn't work
- Trying to outsmart karma
- Resisting necessary lessons
- Blaming circumstances
- Seeking shortcuts
### The Role of Free Will
You always have choice about:
- How you respond to lessons
- What you learn from experiences
- When you decide to grow
- How you use what you learn
Karma provides opportunities - you choose what to do with them. It's like being enrolled in the perfect school - you still have to do the learning.
### The Professional View
Remember: As future divine beings, we need:
- Complete understanding of cause and effect
- Perfect wisdom about life processes
- Deep comprehension of growth patterns
- Mastery of evolutionary principles
This is why experiencing karma consciously is crucial - it's part of our professional development.
Think of it this way: Every experience is either:
- A lesson you need to learn
- A test to put into practice what you've learned
- A chance to help others learn
- An opportunity to demonstrate mastery
- An accident or incident that has nothing to do with you, yet serves you as valuable life experience to evolve your spirit
Understanding this brings remarkable freedom. You're not being punished or rewarded - you're being educated by the most sophisticated system in existence. Every challenge, every joy, every seeming setback or success is perfectly designed for your growth.
The only question is: Will you engage with your curriculum consciously? Will you learn what each experience offers? Will you grow through what life presents? Your karma isn't your enemy - it's your perfect teacher. And its only goal is your evolution into divine being.
CHAPTER 42
## The Sacred Art of Self-Discipline
### Beyond self-Expression to self-Mastery
When Lord Jesus spoke of God as our Father in Heaven, he wasn't just using a convenient metaphor. He was pointing to something profound about divine parenting and human development. Consider how our Divine Parents guide us - with perfect balance of freedom and structure, loving support and necessary boundaries, gentle guidance and firm wisdom. This teaches us something crucial about both parenting and self-discipline.
Think about today's common wisdom that children should express every emotion, act out every impulse, and have their every desire validated. While this sounds loving, it's actually the opposite of divine parenting. It's like giving a child matches to play with because they're fascinated by fire. Real love includes teaching appropriate boundaries and self-mastery.
### The Divine Parent Model
Our Father and Mother in Heaven don't:
-- Remove all obstacles from our path
-- Prevent us from experiencing consequences
-- Shield us from necessary challenges
-- Give us everything we want
Instead, divine parenting:
-- Provides perfect learning opportunities
-- Allows natural consequences to teach
-- Sets appropriate boundaries
-- Guides with wisdom and love
-- Respects our free will while ensuring our curriculum
This is our template for both parenting and self-development. Just as our Divine Parents guide our spiritual evolution through perfect balance of freedom and structure, we must help children develop self-discipline through loving boundaries and respectful guidance.
### The Current Crisis
We're facing an unprecedented situation where:
-- Children are encouraged to act out every impulse
-- Emotions are treated as actions that must be expressed
-- Boundaries are seen as oppression
-- Self-control is viewed as unhealthy
-- Respect is considered optional
-- Wisdom of elders is dismissed
The results are devastating:
-- Young people unable to handle challenges
-- Increasing mental health issues
-- Declining ability to learn from others
-- Growing social dysfunction
-- Lost opportunities for wisdom development
### The Wayist Understanding
True freedom doesn't come from expressing every impulse but from developing self-mastery. Consider:
-- A musician must practice discipline to express music freely
-- An athlete must train rigorously to move effortlessly
-- A martial artist must master basics to flow naturally
-- A divine being must develop perfect self-control to express perfect freedom
This is why Lord Jesus, while teaching love and compassion, also demonstrated remarkable self-discipline. He could:
-- Fast in the desert for extended periods
-- Maintain peace amid chaos
-- Show restraint when provoked
-- Channel energy precisely for healing
-- Master his responses in all situations
### Practical Guidance for Parents
Modern parents face immense challenges, but the principles remain clear:
1. Establish Loving Boundaries
-- Set clear, consistent limits
-- Explain the why behind rules
-- Maintain boundaries with compassion
-- Allow natural consequences to teach
-- Model self-discipline yourself
2. Teach Respect
-- Start with self-respect
-- Extend to all beings
-- Include respect for wisdom
-- Demonstrate respect for others
-- Require respectful behavior
3. Develop Self-Control
-- Start with small challenges
-- Increase gradually
-- Celebrate progress
-- Support during difficulty
-- Maintain consistent expectations
4. Balance Freedom and Structure
-- Allow age-appropriate choices
-- Maintain necessary limits
-- Provide safe spaces to learn
-- Support emotional development
-- Guide rather than control
Remember: Just as our Divine Parents allow us to experience the consequences needed for growth, we must allow children to encounter appropriate challenges. Protection from all difficulty isn't love - it's prevention of necessary development.
### The Path Forward
Teaching self-discipline means:
-- Loving enough to set boundaries
-- Being strong enough to maintain them
-- Staying consistent through challenges
-- Supporting growth through difficulty
-- Modeling what you teach
This isn't easy in a culture that confuses indulgence with love. But remember: Our Divine Parents' perfect love includes perfect discipline. Real freedom comes not from doing whatever we want, but from developing the self-mastery that allows us to choose our responses wisely.
## Learning Through Consequences: Nature's Teaching Method
Consider how karma works - it doesn't punish or reward, it educates through perfect consequences. When we interfere with this natural process by shielding children from all consequences, we're actually blocking their learning opportunities. It's like trying to prevent a butterfly from struggling out of its chrysalis - that very struggle is what strengthens its wings for flight.
The Law of Karma teaches us that:
-- Every action brings its natural learning opportunity
-- Consequences aren't punishment but education
-- Interfering with necessary lessons delays growth
-- Shielding others from their curriculum helps no one
-- True compassion includes allowing natural learning
Applying This Wisdom
When parents constantly shield children from consequences:
-- They delay necessary learning
-- They prevent wisdom development
-- They interfere with karmic education
-- They create future difficulties
-- They block natural growth
Instead, wise parents:
-- Allow appropriate natural consequences
-- Support learning through experience
-- Guide reflection on outcomes
-- Help extract wisdom from challenges
-- Maintain safe boundaries while permitting growth
For example:
-- If a child refuses to do the kindness and duty to help around the house, let them experience going without kindness, help, and you not doing your duty toward them
-- If they won't wear a coat, let them feel cold
-- If they speak disrespectfully, let them experience disrespected
-- If they don't prepare for something, let them face the results
-- If they don't pay loans or take of money and things that cost money, let them experience what you will experience is you do the same---back reputation and high risk loaner, bankruptcy, bank takes back their things and you're up for the debt
This isn't harsh - it's aligned with how the universe teaches. Just as our Divine Parents allow us to experience the consequences we need for growth, wise parenting includes allowing children to learn through natural outcomes of their choices.
A pigeon parent who does not teach their children how to look for seeds and how to crack seed pods may feel okay with themselves because the kids will grow up knowing where the park is and they can get scraps of bread and stuff from old people -- but that is not pigeon food the kids wont grow up healthy and they will suffer. Those parents indirectly inflicted that suffering -- and karma makes a note that it has work to do to help those parents with wisdom -- somehow. Now that is the same as human parents who do not transfer wholesome diet and cooking skills, saying they'll be okay because they know where the burger and pizza places are.
Remember: Karma never gives us more than we can handle, but it always gives us what we need to learn. Parents can follow this model by:
-- Ensuring consequences are age-appropriate
-- Maintaining safety while allowing learning
-- Supporting reflection on experiences
-- Helping extract wisdom from outcomes
-- Showing how choices connect to results
By understanding how karma teaches through consequences, we can better support natural development in ourselves and others. This isn't about punishment - it's about allowing the natural educational system of the universe to do its perfect work.
For parents, teachers, and anyone concerned with human development, the message is clear: True love includes teaching self-discipline. It's one of the greatest gifts we can give the next generation - the ability to master themselves and develop the wisdom that comes only through respectful learning and appropriate self-control.
CHAPTER 43
## Understanding Spiritual Energy
### Not magic, but method
While Christianity transformed Lord Jesus' energy healing practices into miraculous interventions requiring only faith, the reality he taught was far more practical. He spent years training hundreds of energy workers, showing them how to sense, channel, and work with spiritual energies. This wasn't about praying for divine intervention - it was professional training for our future role as cosmic energy workers.
### Beyond Religious Healing
Christians who still believe in the fundamentals of Lord Jesus' healing teachings emphasize:
-- Prayer for healing
-- Faith healing
-- Divine intervention
-- Miraculous cures
Wayist practice involves:
-- Energy awareness
-- Conscious energy work
-- Skilled healing techniques
-- Professional development
### Understanding Energy Reality
Unlike the Christian view of a material world occasionally touched by spirit, we understand that:
-- Everything is energy
-- Different types of energy exist
-- Energy can be sensed and directed
-- Energy work can be learned
### Three Energy Domains
We work with:
**1. Material Energy**
-- Physical matter
-- Bodily functions
-- Environmental forces
-- Natural processes
**2. Soul Energy**
-- Emotional patterns
-- Mental states
-- Psychic forces
-- Personal energies
**3. Spirit Energy**
-- Divine frequencies
-- Higher consciousness
-- Spiritual forces
-- Healing energies
### Practical Energy Skills
Instead of praying for miracles, we develop:
-- Energy sensitivity
-- Healing abilities
-- Clearing techniques
-- Balance methods
-- Protection skills
### Working with Your Tara
Rather than petitioning a distant god:
-- Regular energy alignment
-- Direct spiritual guidance
-- Conscious collaboration
-- Professional mentoring
### Energy Hygiene
Daily practices include:
-- Personal energy clearing
-- Space cleansing
-- Energy boundary maintenance
-- Conscious energy management
### Professional Development
Remember: We're training to be:
-- Cosmic energy healers
-- Spiritual energy workers
-- Universal helpers
-- Divine professionals
### Common Challenges
Watch for:
-- Trying to force results
-- Expecting dramatic effects
-- Neglecting basic practice
-- Forgetting professional purpose
### Safety Guidelines
Essential principles:
-- Always work with your Tara
-- Respect energy boundaries
-- Don't interfere with a person's karma
-- Stay within your capacity
-- Maintain clean energy
### Signs of Progress
You're developing when:
-- Energy sensitivity increases
-- Healing abilities strengthen
-- Professional skills grow
-- Service becomes natural
### The Promise
As you develop:
-- Energy work becomes natural
-- Healing flows easily
-- Service expands
-- Professional capacity grows
Unlike Christianity's emphasis on miraculous intervention through faith, Wayist energy work is practical professional development. Every healing session, every energy practice, is preparation for our eternal work as divine energy beings.
### Living It
Daily practices:
1. Energy awareness
2. Conscious management
3. Regular clearing
4. Skilled service
5. Professional growth
Remember: You're not seeking miracles - you're developing professional skills for eternal service. This is what Lord Jesus actually taught and demonstrated.
CHAPTER 44
## Bridging Understanding and Practice
### Your journey begins
You've just learned some profound truths about your divine nature - your ten minds, your energy anatomy, your spiritual technology. But like a medical student moving from classroom to clinic, the real learning begins when theory meets practice. This is where Lord Jesus focused most of his teaching - not on metaphysical theory but on practical application.
Think about learning to drive. First, you understand the theory - pedals, steering, rules of the road. But real learning starts when you get behind the wheel. Similarly, understanding your ten minds and energy nature is just the foundation. The magic happens when you start living from this understanding.
### The transition might feel challenging at first
- Your brain-mind wants to intellectualize everything
- Your soul-minds resist change to familiar patterns
- Your spirit-minds are just awakening to their potential
- Your old habits and perspectives persist
This is perfectly normal. Just as a new driver gradually coordinates all the different aspects of driving until they become natural, you'll learn to coordinate your complete divine technology through daily practice.
### Consider how this plays out in simple moments
- A challenging interaction becomes practice in energy management
- A difficult decision engages all ten minds consciously
- A routine task transforms into spiritual practice
- An ordinary day becomes divine training
#### The chapters ahead will show you exactly how to
- Apply your understanding in daily life
- Transform ordinary moments into practice
- Develop your divine capacities naturally
- Live as a conscious divine being in training
Remember: Lord Jesus didn't teach theory to amaze people but to transform lives. Every understanding we've explored is meant for practical application. That's what we'll focus on next - turning wisdom into living reality.
## PART 4
### LIVING THE TEACHING
CHAPTER 45
## The Journey Continues
### Living the original teaching
When Lord Jesus taught in Galilee two thousand years ago, he wasn't starting a religion - he was showing a path of conscious evolution that transforms soul into spirit. While Christianity turned his message into religious rules and requirements, the original teaching remains vibrantly alive and profoundly relevant. Perhaps even more so in our time of global awakening and spiritual seeking.
### Think about what we've discovered
- We're not fallen sinners needing salvation, but developing divine beings in perfect training
- We don't need religious intermediaries - each of us has direct access to divine guidance
- We're not working for reward or avoiding punishment - we're evolving naturally toward our divine nature
- This isn't about belief but about conscious transformation through direct experience
### Consider how this transforms everything
-- Instead of praying for divine intervention, we learn to work with spiritual energies
-- Rather than following religious rules, we develop natural wisdom
-- Instead of seeking salvation from an angry God, we engage in conscious evolution
-- Rather than fearing divine judgment, we understand Karma as perfect education
**The path ahead is clear, though not always easy.**
**It involves**
- Growing in energy awareness
- Developing all ten minds
- Working consciously with your Divine Tara
- Living as a divine being in training
- Serving with increasing wisdom and skill
Remember: You're not trying to become something foreign to your nature. Like the caterpillar contains everything needed to become a butterfly, you already possess everything required for divine transformation. The path is about allowing this natural evolution to unfold through conscious participation.
CHAPTER 46
## Finding Peace in Understanding
### The natural ease of the Wayist Path
There's something remarkably liberating about understanding life as a school with students at different levels. When you grasp this, along with the reality of souls evolving through countless experiences, much of life's friction simply dissolves.
## Beyond Expectation and Judgment
Think about how you view a kindergartener:
- You don't expect them to understand calculus
- You don't get angry when they act selfishly
- You don't demand they show mature judgment
- You understand they're exactly where they should be
The same wisdom applies to soul development:
- Soul-people will act like soul-people
- They'll pursue what soul-minds value
- They'll create the societies they understand
- They'll make the choices their consciousness allows
## The Freedom of Understanding
This brings remarkable peace because:
- You stop expecting dolphins to climb trees
- You stop demanding roses from apple trees
- You stop requiring soul-people to show spirit-wisdom
- You accept that each being expresses its nature
When humans disappoint you:
- There's always wisdom in watching ants
- Beauty in observing birds
- Peace in communing with trees
- Joy in sensing divine presence
## Natural Boundaries Without Anger
This understanding allows you to:
- Maintain healthy boundaries without resentment
- Protect what needs protecting without hatred
- Work for positive change without frustration
- Stay peaceful while being practical
You can:
- Oppose harmful actions while understanding their source
- Work for justice without becoming bitter
- Protect the vulnerable without hating the strong
- Stay centered while engaging with challenges
## The Joy of Non-Expectation
There's profound peace in:
- Accepting things as they are while working for what could be
- Understanding others' limitations while maintaining your own standards
- Seeing beauty in simplicity when complexity disappoints
- Finding wisdom in nature when humans seem lost
## Practical Application
This means:
- No energy wasted on impossible expectations
- No emotional drainage from constant disappointment
- No spiritual erosion from sustained anger
- No loss of peace from others' choices
Instead:
- Energy preserved for positive action
- Emotions available for joy and compassion
- Spirit growing through understanding
- Peace maintained through wisdom
## The Natural Way
Life becomes easier because:
- You're not fighting reality
- You're not demanding the impossible
- You're not expecting what can't be given
- You're not losing peace over others' nature
This is why Wayists often seem:
- More peaceful than their circumstances might suggest
- More joyful despite life's challenges
- More effective in their actions
- More consistent in their growth
It's not that we've given up on positive change or accepted injustice. We've simply learned to:
- Work with what is
- Understand what can be
- Accept what must be
- Change what should be
All while maintaining our inner peace and joy.
CHAPTER 47
## The Universal Gift
### Heaven within reach of all
Picture a poor mother in a remote village. Her child is sick. She has no money for temple offerings, can't read sacred texts, and lives far from any religious authority. Yet through Lord Jesus' teaching, she knows something profound: She can connect directly with heaven. Her simple home shrine is as sacred as any temple. Her heartfelt prayer reaches divine ears as clearly as any priest's chant. Her Divine Tara hears and guides her just as surely as any religious expert.
This was Lord Jesus' revolutionary gift to humanity - not a new religion, but the shattering of religious barriers between humans and heaven. Before him:
- Only monks could meditate
- Only priests could pray effectively
- Only temples held sacred power
- Only the educated could access wisdom

A contemporary depiction of how someone visualize their Tara
**With his teaching**
- Every home became a potential shrine
- Every heart could connect directly with heaven
- Every person could access divine wisdom
- Every soul could walk the path
This wasn't just spiritually revolutionary - it was politically explosive. Religious authorities maintained power by positioning themselves as necessary intermediaries between humans and the divine. Lord Jesus bypassed this entire power structure, placing divine connection directly in everyone's hands.
**Think about what this meant for ordinary people**
- A farmer could commune with heaven while working his fields
- A mother could receive divine guidance while caring for her children
- A slave could experience spiritual freedom despite physical bondage
- Anyone could develop divine wisdom regardless of education or status
**This is why you'll find**
- Simple shrines in humble homes across Asia
- Direct divine connection in daily life
- Profound wisdom in illiterate elders
- Sacred practice without religious trappings
**The most enlightened Wayist might be**
- An old grandmother who never read a book
- A farmer who never entered a temple
- A village woman who never saw a city
- A person who never heard of Wayism
**This is why Avalokiteshvara (the un-incarnated Lord Jesus) is celebrated across Asia as**
- Guanyin in China
- Kannon in Japan
- KwanAm in Korea
- The divine hearer of all cries everywhere

Lord Avalokiteshvara with 1000 arms to help, and 1000 faces to appear to all as they feel comfortable
**Billions recognize this gift of direct divine access. It extends far beyond Christianity's scope because it's**
- Not limited to believers
- Not controlled by institutions
- Not dependent on education
- Not restricted by culture
**Every person can**
- Connect with divine guidance
- Access spiritual wisdom
- Walk the path directly
- Experience heaven within
**This is perhaps Lord Jesus' greatest gift to humanity - not a new religion, but the breaking of religious chains that kept heaven distant from human hearts.**
**He showed that divine connection isn't about**
- Religious authority
- Institutional power
- Educational achievement
- Social status
**But about**
Direct divine connection
- Personal spiritual experience
- Individual transformation
- Universal access to heaven
This is why his impact extends far beyond Christianity, touching billions of lives across time and culture. It's not about believing in Lord Jesus - it's about accessing the divine connection he showed was possible for every soul. The question isn't whether you're worthy of divine connection - that connection is your birthright. The question is whether you're ready to accept this gift of direct divine access, bypassing all human systems that claim exclusive rights to heaven.
In our next chapter, we'll explore how to develop this direct connection practically. But first, consider how this understanding transforms your view of spirituality. You don't need permission to connect with heaven. You don't need an interpreter for divine wisdom. You don't need institutional approval for spiritual growth. Everything you need is already within you, waiting to be recognized and developed.
CHAPTER 48
## Living Spirituality
### More than prayers and penance
While Christianity focuses on church attendance, prescribed prayers, and religious rituals, Jesus actually taught something radically different - a practical spirituality woven into every moment of daily life. When he said "pray without ceasing," he wasn't suggesting endless religious recitation, but constant spiritual awareness.
### Beyond Religious Practice
Religions emphasize:
- Church or mosque attendance at set intervals
- Structured prayers or performed by a minister
- Religious rituals and rites for naming, initiation, dying
- Worship sessions led by others
- Sin confession and sin taxes
Wayist practice involves:
- Moment-by-moment awareness
- Energy consciousness
- Natural communion with your Tara
- Living meditation
- Constant growth
### Daily Spiritual Life
Instead of setting aside special "holy times," the Wayist approach makes every moment sacred:
**Morning Practice**
- Dayspring face washing ritual
- Acknowledge your Divine Tara
- Set conscious intention
- Check energy levels
- Plan mindful living (Not morning prayers for divine favor)
**Throughout the Day**
- Maintain energy awareness
- Practice conscious choice
- Live with full presence
- Serve where needed
- Attitude of prayerfulness or meditation when you feel like it
**Evening Practice**
- Review lessons learned
- Appreciate growth
- Commune with your Tara

- Release accumulated energies (Not confessing sins or seeking forgiveness)
**Bodily Mindfulness** (everything is sacred, a miracle that needs our joyful, awe, and mindful attention)
- Digestion and food assimilation awareness
- Skin, gut, mouth, and hair environment for organic biome friends
- Mindfulness of ablutions
- Hormone function, endocrine and nervous system awareness
- Muscle, joints, and fluids
## The Power of Attitude
While Christianity emphasizes correct belief and behavior, Wayism focuses on attitude as our primary spiritual tool:
- Instantly changes energy
- Transforms situations
- Affects environments
- Influences others
#### **Working with Energy**
Unlike conventional Christian prayer for divine intervention, Wayists practice:
- Regular energy sensing
- Conscious energy management
- Healing energy work
- Environment cleansing
#### Spiritual Connection
Instead of praying to a distant deity:
- Regular communion with your Tara
- Direct spiritual experience
- Natural divine connection
- Constant inner guidance
#### **Living Meditation**
Beyond formal prayer sessions:
- Mindful eating
- Conscious movement
- Aware breathing
- Present living
- Constant growth
#### **Practical Service**
Rather than religious good works:
- Natural helpfulness
- Energy assistance
- Conscious support
- Spontaneous service
#### **Signs of Development**
You're progressing when:
- Practice becomes natural
- Awareness stays constant
- Service flows spontaneously
- Joy emerges naturally
- Living becomes meditation
#### **Common Pitfalls**
Watch out for:
- Making practice religious
- Creating rigid routines
- Seeking dramatic experiences
- Forgetting natural simplicity
#### **The Professional Angle**
Remember: We're developing:
- Natural divine consciousness
- Constant spiritual awareness
- Spontaneous right action
- Effortless proper living
### Living It
Practice through:
1. Conscious choice
2. Energy awareness
3. Present living
4. Natural service
5. Constant growth
### The Promise
As you develop:
- Life becomes practice
- Practice becomes life
- Spirituality becomes natural
- Growth becomes constant
Unlike religious practices that separate "spiritual" time from "regular" life, the Wayist approach transforms every moment into spiritual opportunity. As Jesus demonstrated, true spirituality isn't about special times or places - it's about living consciously all the time.
Remember: You're not trying to be religious - you're developing natural divine consciousness. Every moment of life is your practice ground.
CHAPTER 49
## Living the Way in Today's World
"But how does all this work in real life?" It's a fair question. After all, we're not walking the trade routes of ancient Asia or studying in Alexandria. We're dealing with mortgages, social media, artificial intelligence, and the complexities of modern life. Let's explore how Jesus' original teachings apply directly to our world.
First, understand that you're already on the path. Every human experience - from navigating office politics to managing digital overload - is part of your soul's education. The key isn't changing what you do but becoming conscious of how you do it.
#### Start with where you are right now
- Your job isn't just making money - it's a daily arena for practicing awareness
- Your relationships aren't just personal connections - they're opportunities for spiritual growth

- Your challenges aren't just problems - they're precisely designed learning experiences
- Your daily routine isn't just habit - it's your practice ground
Consider how this transforms common situations:
At Work:
- Difficult colleagues become teachers of patience
- Deadlines become lessons in presence
- Meetings become opportunities for energy work
- Challenges become growth catalysts
In Relationships:
- Conflicts become chances for wisdom development
- Connections become spiritual practice
- Communication becomes energy work
- Daily interactions become opportunities for service
With Technology:
- Social media becomes a field for practicing detachment
- Digital devices become tools for conscious choice
- Information overload becomes discernment training
- Virtual connections become opportunities for real presence
Your most powerful tool is something Jesus emphasized constantly: the ability to change energy through attitude. Think of attitude as your personal energy management system. Having a rough day at work? You can literally transform the energy of the situation by shifting your attitude.
This isn't positive thinking or denial of problems. It's about understanding that you can choose how to engage with any situation. Jesus demonstrated this repeatedly - maintaining inner peace while confronting injustice, showing compassion while standing firm against exploitation.
### Remember that Divine Tara we talked about? They're with you during
- Business meetings
- Family disputes
- Traffic jams
- Digital overwhelm
- Every modern challenge
Your Tara communicates through:
- Intuitive nudges during decisions
- Sudden insights in difficult situations
- Clear knowing in confused times
- Guidance through modern complexity
The path unfolds through ordinary life experiences lived consciously:
- Your office can be your meditation hall
- Your commute can be practice time
- Your relationships can be your spiritual training
- Your challenges can be your teachers
Modern life isn't an obstacle to spiritual practice - it's the perfect arena for it. Every situation offers opportunities to:
- Practice energy awareness
- Develop wisdom
- Express compassion
- Grow spiritually
- Live authentically
- Self-assessment if what you are doing serves the purpose of life or are you serving someone else's ideology
This is the art of living theWAY in today's world - not escaping from life but engaging it more consciously, not avoiding modernity but using it for spiritual growth, not waiting for better circumstances but transforming the ones you have.
CHAPTER 50
## The Living Universe
### Our teachers everywhere
When you really start paying attention to nature, something extraordinary happens - your sense of human superiority quietly dissolves. Let's look at the wisdom that surrounds us every day.
## The Intelligence of Our Neighbors
Consider the octopus, who can solve complex puzzles, use tools, and even predict human behavior. Without our type of brain, without our technology, these beings demonstrate intelligence that sometimes surpasses our own. Or watch a colony of ants:
- Engineering climate-controlled cities
- Practicing sustainable agriculture
- Running complex social organizations
- Solving logistical problems that challenge our best computers
The more we learn about other beings, the more our assumptions about human supremacy crumble:
- Bees perform complex mathematical calculations to optimize their foraging
- Trees communicate through underground fungal networks
- Birds navigate using quantum entanglement
- Slime molds can solve complex network problems faster than our computers
## The Wisdom of Plant Communities
Walk into a forest with awareness and you're entering a vast, intelligent community:
- Trees share resources through their "wood wide web"
- Plants warn each other of dangers
- Different species cooperate to create sustainable ecosystems
- Every organism knows its role without being taught
This isn't just poetic metaphor - it's documented science. The forest as a whole demonstrates intelligence that no single organism possesses. When we really grasp this, our human achievements start to look rather modest.
## The Living Earth
Even what we consider "inanimate" matter shows remarkable organization:
- Crystals grow with mathematical precision
- Minerals form intricate patterns
- Water molecules dance in response to energy
- Rocks slowly breathe and transform
Every particle, every atom, every energy structure has its own kind of consciousness, its own way of participating in The Way.
## The Humbling Reality
When we truly open to this awareness, we realize:
- We're not the crown of creation
- We're just one type of consciousness among many
- Our intelligence isn't superior, just different
- We have so much to learn from our fellow beings
## Learning from Life
Each being becomes our teacher:
- The patience of mountains
- The flexibility of water
- The resilience of weeds
- The cooperation of forests
- The efficiency of fungi
- The adaptability of microbes
## Beyond Anthropocentric Thinking
This understanding transforms how we see our role:
- Not as rulers of nature
- Not as stewards of Earth
- But as students in a vast living university
- As participants in an incredible cosmic dance
The Earth doesn't need our protection - she's been nurturing life for billions of years. Our role is to learn, to grow, to evolve in consciousness until we can participate more fully in the cosmic process.
## Living with This Awareness
This changes how we:
- Walk through nature
- Interact with other beings
- Use natural resources
- Understand our place in the cosmos
Every encounter becomes an opportunity for learning:
- A spider teaching about patience and artistry
- A dandelion demonstrating resilience
- A cloud showing impermanence
- A stone revealing stability
## The Joy of Cosmic Humility
This isn't a depressing realization - it's liberating. When we understand our true place in the living cosmos:
- We can relax our need to control
- We can learn from everything
- We can appreciate our role while staying humble
- We can feel the joy of being part of something vast and beautiful
This is what Jesus meant when he spoke of the lilies of the field. They don't strive or compete - they simply are, manifesting divine intelligence perfectly without effort.
CHAPTER 51
## One Family, Infinite Expressions
### Beyond the illusion of separation
Think about this: In your journey of countless incarnations, you've likely been every race, every gender, every nationality you can imagine. You've probably been both conqueror and conquered, rich and poor, celebrated and despised. When you really grasp this, racism becomes absurd - you're literally prejudiced against your own past and future selves.
## The Web of Life
**Consider a forest again:**
- The maple doesn't reject the oak for being different
- The robin doesn't discriminate against the sparrow
- The soil doesn't choose which seeds to nourish
- The rain falls on all without preference
Nature shows us that diversity isn't just beautiful - it's essential. An ecosystem's strength lies in its variety. Yet humans, who should know better, create artificial divisions based on superficial differences.
## Beyond Surface Appearances
When Lord Jesus taught about loving our neighbors, he was shattering conventional boundaries:
- Samaritans and Jews (two tribes of Israel) who hated each other? Neighbors.
- Romans and locals? Neighbors.
- Different social classes? Neighbors.
- Other species? Yes, neighbors too.
He wasn't being poetically inclusive - he was stating a practical reality. We are all soul beings sharing:
- The same divine origin
- The same evolutionary journey
- The same ultimate destiny
- The same cosmic classroom
## The Curriculum of Diversity
Our soul's education requires experiencing life from every angle:
- Different cultural perspectives
- Various social positions
- Multiple gender experiences
- Diverse racial identities
Why? Because complete wisdom can only come from understanding life from all sides. You can't graduate from the school of divine wisdom without developing universal compassion and understanding.
## The Practical Reality
**This understanding transforms how we view**
- Cultural differences (future learning opportunities)
- Social inequalities (temporary roles in the cosmic drama)
- Racial tensions (family squabbles in the larger perspective)
- Species divisions (different classrooms in the same school)
Each human soul you meet is:
- Another version of yourself at a different stage
- A fellow student in the cosmic school of divinity
- A potential teacher of unique wisdom
- A neighbor in the deepest sense
### Living This Truth
This isn't about ignoring injustice or accepting discrimination. Instead, it's about:
- Recognizing artificial divisions
- Working to heal unnecessary separation
- Celebrating essential diversity
- Understanding our fundamental unity
**When we realize humans are all**
- Souls in training
- Future divine beings
- Part of the same journey
- Connected in essence
**When we realize all souls are all**
- Made of the same Universal energy from Source
- Are intelligent and sense our energies
- Communicate with other souls and probably try to communicate with us
- In the same cycle of samsara, perpetual reincarnation, than us
- Are more ecologically responsible than us
- Deserve to be regarded as neighbours and must have living space and space to feed and breed and enjoy life
**Then we naturally**
- Treat all beings with respect
- Learn from every encounter
- Work for universal wellbeing
- Celebrate diversity while recognizing unity
## The Joy of Recognition
There's a profound joy in recognizing yourself in others:
- In the eyes of a stranger
- In the flight of a bird
- In the growth of a tree
- In the face of someone seemingly different
This recognition leads to:
- Natural compassion
- Spontaneous kindness
- Genuine appreciation
- Universal love
## The Practical Path
This understanding changes how we:
- Interact with different cultures
- Approach other species
- Handle conflicts
- View social issues
Every encounter becomes:
- A reunion with another part of yourself
- An opportunity for deeper understanding
- A chance to experience unity
- A moment of divine recognition
This is the profound truth Lord Jesus taught - not just that we should love our neighbors, but that in the deepest sense, our neighbors are ourselves. All distinctions are temporary; our unity is eternal.
When you penetrate deeply enough into your own nature, you discover something that religious authorities often try to hide - your essential oneness with divine reality. Julian of Norwich, writing from her anchorite's cell in medieval England, dared to express this truth directly:
### I IT AM
> *I it am.*
> *The greatness and goodness of the Father,*
> *I it am;*
> *the wisdom and kindness of the Mother,*
> *I it am.*
For us it isn't religious blasphemy as it was for Christians, but mystical realization - the same truth Lord Jesus expressed when he said 'I and the Father are one and so you should become.' It's not about personal ego but about recognizing your divine nature in becoming.
CHAPTER 52
## Joy and Celebration
### Why divine beings are naturally happy
Here's something profound: Joy isn't just an emotion - it's the natural state of divine beings. When religious people criticized Lord Jesus for being too joyful, too celebratory, they missed something crucial: He was demonstrating the natural state of evolved consciousness.
## Beyond Religious Solemnity
#### Traditional religion often
- Values solemnity over joy
- Prefers seriousness to celebration
- Suspects pleasure
- Distrusts happiness
#### But divine beings are naturally
- Joyful without cause
- Celebratory in nature
- Light in spirit
- Happy in being
- Benevolent, they have no need to cause harm
### Why Joy Matters
**Joy is important because**
- It's our natural state
- It facilitates growth
- It enables healing
- It reflects truth
- It attracts positivity
## The Nature of Divine Joy
#### This isn't about
- Temporary happiness
- Emotional highs
- Pleasure seeking
- Artificial cheer
#### But about
- Natural celebration of being
- Spontaneous appreciation
- Inherent delight
- Essential gladness
## Joy as Practice
#### Cultivating joy through
- Conscious appreciation
- Natural celebration
- Spontaneous delight
- Present moment awareness
#### Common Obstacles
**Watch for**
- Taking life too seriously
- Confusing solemnity with spirituality
- Mistrusting pleasure
- Resisting natural joy
### Signs of Development
**You're progressing when**
- Joy becomes more natural
- Celebration feels spontaneous
- Happiness needs no reason
- Delight flows easily
### The Professional Angle
**Remember: As future divine beings, we're developing**
- Natural joyfulness
- Spontaneous celebration
- Inherent happiness
- Essential lightness
### Practical Steps
**To cultivate joy**
- Notice natural beauty
- Appreciate small things
- Celebrate regularly
- Live lightly
- Play often
### The Balance
**True spiritual joy is**
- Deep but light
- Serious but playful
- Profound but simple
- Meaningful but free
### Warning Signs
**Watch out when you**
- Take yourself too seriously
- Lose your sense of play
- Forget to celebrate
- Miss life's delight
### The Promise
**As you develop**
- Joy becomes natural
- Celebration flows
- Happiness deepens
- Life lightens
Remember: You're not becoming more serious - you're evolving toward your naturally joyful divine nature.
### Living It
**Daily practices**
- Find reasons to celebrate
- Share joy with others
- Appreciate everything
- Live lightly
- Play freely
Because in the end, divine beings aren't solemn - they're naturally, effortlessly happy. That's what we're evolving toward.
CHAPTER 53
## Meditation
### Beyond prayer into presence
When you really grasp this shift from religious prayer to direct presence, something extraordinary happens. The very nature of divine connection transforms.
Picture this: A group of religious people kneeling in a church, desperately petitioning God for help. Now contrast that with Lord Jesus sitting quietly by the Sea of Galilee, perfectly attuned to divine reality, teaching others to experience the same direct connection. This difference captures exactly why Wayist meditation is nothing like religious prayer disguised in Eastern postures.
When Lord Jesus taught meditation, he wasn't showing people how to ask favors from a distant deity. When he said "I am in theWAY...and so should you be" he was teaching where we will find being grounded and what energy resonance we need in higher-self to connect with Heaven.
He was demonstrating how to develop the consciousness we'll need as divine beings ourselves. Think about it - if you're training to become a cosmic energy healer, wouldn't you need to develop deeper awareness than just knowing how to recite prayers?
Listen how Ajate of theWAY puts it:
### "Beyond Prayer"
*I used to kneel and plead with words,*
*Like throwing wishes down a well,*
*Each prayer a coin tossed hopefully*
*Into depths I could not tell.*
*Until one day I simply sat,*
*No words, no wishes, just my breath,*
*And found what I had sought so long*
*Was here, had never left.*
*Not in the clouds or sacred books,*
*Not in temples grand and high,*
*But in the space between my thoughts,*
*Where soul and spirit lie.*
*Now silence is my truest prayer,*
*And presence is my grace.*
*Each moment holds divinity*
*When I make my heart its place.*
*No more do I reach outward far -*
*That searching now has ceased.*
*For what I thought was far away*
*Was here within, released.*
This isn't just beautiful poetry - it's a description of what happens when you move beyond religious obligation into direct divine relationship. Prayer becomes communion, duty becomes joy, and every moment becomes an opportunity for divine connection.
This is why Lord Jesus spent so much time teaching energy awareness rather than prayer formulas. He knew that real meditation is professional development for our eternal vocation. Every time you sit in silence, you're not just finding peace - you're developing the consciousness that will let you work with cosmic energies and serve beings across the galaxy.
But here's where many seekers get stuck. They try to make meditation more complicated than it needs to be, or they reduce it to simple relaxation. The reality lies deeper. Just as a medical student needs to develop diagnostic awareness beyond what average people notice, we need to develop spiritual awareness beyond ordinary consciousness.
Consider how a doctor learns to feel subtle differences in tissue that most people would miss. Similarly, through meditation we learn to:
- Sense different types of energy
- Distinguish between soul impulses and spirit guidance
- Recognize divine presence
- Work with cosmic forces
This isn't mystical theory - it's practical professional development. Every meditation session is like a training shift in the hospital of the universe. You're learning skills you'll use for eternity.
The process starts simple but profound:
- Regular periods of inner silence
- Conscious energy awareness
- Direct communion with your Divine Tara
- Gradual development of higher perception
Don't worry if this seems challenging at first. Remember learning to drive? Initially, coordinating the gas, brake, steering, mirrors, and road awareness seemed impossible. Now you do it without thinking. The same happens with meditation - what starts as conscious effort becomes natural capacity.
Your Divine Tara guides this development perfectly. Unlike religious prayer where you hope someone's listening, in Wayist meditation you're working directly with a master teacher who knows exactly what you need. They'll help you develop:
- Clear energy perception
- Direct spiritual communion
- Professional healing abilities
- Divine consciousness
The beauty is that this isn't about achieving some special state. It's about developing the awareness that is your natural inheritance as a future divine being. Every meditation session moves you closer to who you're meant to become.
Most importantly, understand that meditation isn't an escape from life but a deeper engagement with reality. It's not about floating away on clouds of bliss but developing the consciousness needed to serve effectively across the cosmos.
This is what Lord Jesus meant when he said "The kingdom of heaven is within you." He wasn't speaking metaphorically - he was pointing to the divine consciousness we can all develop through direct practice. Every time you sit in meditation, you're not just finding temporary peace - you're developing your eternal divine nature.
## The Natural Way
Life becomes easier because:
- You're not fighting reality
- You're not demanding the impossible
- You're not expecting what can't be given
- You're not losing peace over others' nature
This is why Wayists often seem:
- More peaceful than their circumstances might suggest
- More joyful despite life's challenges
- More effective in their actions
- More consistent in their growth
It's not that we've given up on positive change or accepted injustice. We've simply learned to:
- Work with what is
- Understand what can be
- Accept what must be
- Change what should be
All while maintaining our inner peace and joy.
This is perhaps one of the greatest gifts of the Wayist path - the ability to engage fully with life while maintaining perspective, peace, and purpose.
CHAPTER 54
## The Power of Direct Experience
### Beyond belief to knowing
This discovery of divine presence within isn't unique to any tradition. Listen to how Akka Mahadevi, a 12th-century Indian mystic, describes the moment of recognition:
### When I didn't know myself
*When I didn't know myself*
*where were you?*
*Like the colour in the gold,*
*you were in me.*
*I saw in you,*
*lord white as jasmine,*
*the paradox of your being*
*in me*
*without showing a limb.*
Like Lord Jesus teaching that the kingdom of heaven is within, she's pointing to something profound - divine reality isn't somewhere else, waiting to be reached. It's already here, waiting to be recognized.
When Lord Jesus said "Come and see," he wasn't inviting people to believe something - he was inviting them to experience something. This distinction transforms everything about spiritual development. It's the difference between reading about honey and actually tasting it, between studying about water and learning to swim.
### Think about how Lord Jesus actually taught
- He didn't lecture about healing - he demonstrated it
- He didn't theorize about divine presence - he showed people how to experience it
- He didn't philosophize about energy - he taught people to work with it
- He didn't preach about transformation - he guided people through it
This is the radical difference between Wayist practice and religious belief. Instead of accepting doctrines, we're invited to:
- Experience divine reality directly
- Sense spiritual energies personally
- Develop wisdom through practice
- Know truth through direct perception
### Consider these contrasts
Religious Belief | Direct Experience
- Accepting what others say | Knowing for yourself
- Following rules | Developing wisdom
- Learning doctrine | Growing through practice
- Worshipping the divine | Experiencing divine reality
### Lord Jesus emphasized this when he said "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." Notice he didn't say
- "You will believe the truth"
- "You will learn about the truth"
- "You will accept the truth"
- "You will understand the truth"
### He said you will KNOW it - through direct experience
This is why Wayist practice focuses on:
- Energy awareness exercises
- Direct spiritual communion
- Practical wisdom development
- Personal experience of truth
Every aspect of practice is experiential:
- Don't just believe in energy - learn to sense it
- Don't just accept divine presence - experience it
- Don't just study wisdom - develop it
- Don't just worship the divine - know it directly
Think of it like learning to swim:
- Reading about swimming won't keep you afloat
- Believing in swimming won't help you move through water
- Understanding swimming theory isn't enough
- You have to get in the water and experience it
The same is true for spiritual development:
- Belief doesn't transform consciousness
- Theory doesn't develop wisdom
- Doctrine doesn't awaken spirit
- Only direct experience creates real growth
This is why Lord Jesus often said "Those who have eyes to see, let them see." He wasn't talking about physical sight but about the capacity for direct spiritual perception that we all can develop through practice.
#### Every day offers opportunities for direct experience
- Sensing energy in food before eating
- Feeling the presence of your Divine Tara
- Experiencing spiritual reality in nature
- Developing wisdom through conscious living
The invitation is always the same: "Come and see." Not come and believe, come and accept, come and worship - but come and experience for yourself.
CHAPTER 55
## Sacred Living in a Modern World
### Finding divine reality in digital chaos
You wake to a smartphone alarm, face a day packed with online meetings, navigate social media, handle endless emails and messages, buy food and eat, commute, take out the trash, and fall asleep to social media.
Where's the sacred in all this? Everywhere - if you know how to see it.
Think about how Lord Jesus taught - not by retreating from life but by transforming everyday moments into opportunities for spiritual growth.
Today's world gives us more opportunities than ever, just in different forms:
## Digital Life as Spiritual Practice
### Your smartphone can become
- A reminder to check in with your Divine Tara
- An opportunity to practice conscious choice
- A tool for mindful communication
- A chance to maintain boundaries
- A test of spiritual presence
### Social Media Wisdom
- Practice non-attachment to likes and comments
- Transform scrolling into conscious observation
- Use platforms for genuine connection
- Maintain energy boundaries online
- Share authentic light rather than artificial image
## Work Life as Sacred Space
### Modern work becomes spiritual practice through
- Seeing each task as service
- Treating colleagues as souls in training
- Using challenges for growth
- Maintaining divine connection during meetings
- Practicing energy awareness in all interactions
## Environmental Consciousness
### In a world of Earth awareness crisis
- Practice reverence for nature
- Make conscious consumption choices
- See interconnection in all things
- Take responsibility for energy impact
- Find ways to serve all living beings, give back what we take out
### Urban Spirituality
Cities become spiritual training grounds by:
- Finding sacred space in small moments
- Creating energy sanctuaries at home
- Practicing presence in crowds
- Sensing divine reality amid concrete
- Transforming noise into background for inner silence
## Relationship in Digital Age
### Modern connections require
- Conscious online presence
- Energy awareness in virtual meetings
- Authentic connection amid artificial networks
- Balance between digital and direct interaction
- Spiritual discernment in all communications
## Time Management as Spiritual Art
### Transform busyness through
- Making each moment sacred
- Finding divine presence in transit
- Using waiting time for practice
- Transforming delays into meditation
- Seeing interruptions as growth opportunities
The key isn't escaping modern life but transforming how we engage with it. Every aspect of contemporary existence can become:
- An opportunity for presence
- A chance for service
- A moment of growth
- A practice of awareness
- A connection with divine reality
Remember: You're not meant to reject technology or modern life. You're meant to engage with it consciously, using everything as opportunity for spiritual development. This is what Lord Jesus demonstrated - not escape from life but transformation of every moment into sacred experience.
## Practical Steps
### Start Your Day
- Connect with your Tara before checking devices
- Set conscious intention for divine awareness
- Create energy boundaries for the day
- Practice presence in morning routine
- Transform commute into meditation
### During Work
- Maintain divine connection in meetings
- Practice energy awareness with colleagues
- See service opportunities everywhere
- Use breaks for spiritual renewal
- Transform challenges into growth
### Evening Practice
- Consciously disconnect from digital noise
- Review the day's lessons
- Release accumulated energies
- Connect deeply with divine guidance
- Prepare for conscious rest
The question isn't how to find sacred space apart from modern life - it's how to transform every aspect of contemporary existence into opportunity for spiritual growth. This is the art of sacred living in a digital age - not escape from reality but transformation of how we engage with it.
Remember: Every moment, every interaction, every challenge in modern life is an opportunity to practice presence, develop wisdom, and grow spiritually. The only question is: Are you ready to engage with life this consciously?
CHAPTER 56
## Divine Service
### Why we're really here
Picture graduating from the finest medical school in the universe. You've spent lifetimes learning, growing, developing perfect ethics and mastering energy healing. Now you're ready to begin your real work - helping beings across the galaxy evolve and heal. This isn't just a metaphor - it's exactly what we're preparing for through spiritual evolution.
Think about it: Why would divine beings spend so much time helping souls evolve if not to add to their own ranks? This is what Lord Jesus meant by 'eternal life' - not endless existence as a human soul, but graduation into immortal spiritual service. When he demonstrated healing and taught others to heal, he wasn't just addressing temporary suffering - he was providing professional training for our eternal vocation.
### Beyond Religious Service
When most people think of 'divine service,' they imagine:
- Religious rituals
- Temple offerings
- Prayer and worship
- Religious obligations
But true divine service is something far more profound:
- Energy healing on a cosmic scale
- Guiding souls toward evolution
- Working with divine energies
- Universal helpful presence
This isn't about earning spiritual points or accumulating good karma. It's practical preparation for our future role. Every act of service now is professional development for your eternal career as a divine being.
### Why Service Matters
Consider: If you're training to become a cosmic healer, wouldn't it make sense to start developing healing abilities now? If you're going to work with beings across the galaxy, wouldn't it be wise to practice universal compassion here? Every opportunity to serve others is like a training shift in the hospital of the universe.
## The Evolution of Service
As we develop, service becomes:
- Less about doing good deeds
- More about being naturally helpful
- Less about choosing to serve
- More about serving by nature
Like water naturally flowing downhill, divine beings naturally serve. They don't decide to be helpful any more than the sun decides to shine - it's simply their nature.
### What We're Training For
Our eternal work will involve:
- Healing disturbed energies
- Guiding evolving souls
- Maintaining cosmic harmony
- Supporting universal evolution
This is why Lord Jesus spent so much time teaching energy healing. He wasn't just addressing temporary suffering - he was providing professional training for eternal service.
### The Professional Skills
We're developing:
- Perfect ethics without effort
- Universal compassion
- Energy mastery
- Divine wisdom
- Natural helpfulness
These aren't just virtues to cultivate - they're professional requirements for our future work.
### Why Start Now?
Every current opportunity for service is professional practice:
- That moment of helping someone in need? Clinical experience
- That chance to share wisdom? Teaching practice
- That opportunity to heal? Skill development
- That challenge to show compassion? Professional growth
### The Mark of Maturity
True divine service becomes:
- Natural not forced
- Joyful not dutiful
- Skillful not just well-meaning
- Professional not amateur
You'll know you're progressing when service:
- Feels like your natural state
- Brings genuine joy
- Shows increasing skill
- Flows spontaneously
Remember: You're not just trying to be good - you're preparing for your eternal profession as a divine being. Every act of service is professional development for your ultimate career. The only question is: Are you ready to start your training consciously?
The beauty is that you're already in training. Every interaction, every opportunity to help, every chance to share wisdom is developing your professional capacity. When you understand this, even small acts of service take on profound significance - they're all preparation for your eternal work as a divine being.
CHAPTER 57
## Living Divinely Human
### Where spirit meets earth
When you really grasp that you're a divine being in training, using a sensuous human body as your learning vehicle, everything changes. Suddenly, every experience - from morning coffee to midnight worries - becomes part of your spiritual curriculum.
Consider your morning routine. Most people experience this only through brain-mind - just going through the motions. But watch what happens when you engage all ten minds:
### Body-Minds
- Brain-mind appreciates the morning quiet and slow waking
- Organ-mind responds to gentle awakening, starting with water
- Microbiome-mind signals what your system needs (less chemicals in lotions and soaps, protein for breakfast no sugar, etc.)
### Soul-Minds
- Muladhara enjoys the security of routine
- Svadhisthana delights in sensory experiences and thinks about your appearance
- Manipura makes conscious choices about priorities and wants to know what's happening on the news, but decides its all just propaganda and lies, so settles for a funny video clip or meme on social media.
### Spirit-Minds
- Anahata feels gratitude for a new day and reminisce yesterday and sees the birds outside and wonders if they have food enough for their babies and appreciates the energies of sleeping with loving-kindness
- Vishuddhi reflects on deeper meaning of something that happened last night and works on extracting wisdom from it
- Ajna senses subtle energies in the room and worries about the effect of energies you experience at work
- Sahasrara connects to divine purpose and really wants to have some spirit time with your Tara to make sure all your energies are in good order
This isn't about complicating simple activities. It's about experiencing life more fully, using all your capacities. The same approach transforms everything:
### Relationships become spiritual practice
- Every interaction is energy work
- Each challenge develops wisdom
- All connections offer growth
- Every conflict brings learning
- Every loving and sensuous connection is healing
### Work becomes divine service
- Tasks become opportunities for presence
- Colleagues become teachers
- Challenges become growth catalysts
- Service becomes natural
### Even rest becomes sacred
- Sleep becomes conscious surrender and the brain clears the dust of the day
- Dreams offer food for self-knowledge and sometimes divine guidance
- Relaxation becomes energy renewal and attuning to Tara
- Quiet becomes communion
### Money and material life transform
- Resources become tools for growth
- Possessions become teaching aids
- Commerce becomes energy exchange
- Wealth becomes opportunity for service
- Priorities change as you awaken to reality
### Technology becomes spiritual tool
- Devices remind us to stay present
- Social media teaches detachment
- Digital choices develop discernment
- Virtual connections practice real presence
## The art of daily transformation involves
### Morning
- Wake with gratitude and sense of purpose of life
- Sense the day's energy
- Align with your Divine Tara
- Set conscious intention
### Throughout the Day
- Practice energy awareness
- Maintain divine perspective
- Transform challenges through attitude
- Find joy in simple moments
### Evening
- Review lessons learned (review your your day)
- Release unwanted energies and cleanse
- Practice conscious completion
- Prepare for spiritual renewal, sleep well
Remember: Lord Jesus didn't teach a path of denial or escape. He showed us how to live fully while evolving spiritually. Every experience, every sensation, every challenge and joy becomes part of our transformation when we understand its true purpose.
This is true spirituality - not removed from life but fully immersed in it. It's about becoming more fully human while developing our divine potential. And perhaps most importantly, it's about doing this with joy, wonder, and appreciation for the incredible journey we're on.
CHAPTER 58
## Spiritual Community
### Authentic connection in a digital age
Imagine a network of individuals, each walking their own path, yet supporting each other's evolution without hierarchy, dogma, or rigid structure. This isn't some utopian dream - it's the Wayist vision of spiritual community that's becoming more possible than ever in our connected world.
Think about it: While traditional religious communities are declining, genuine spiritual connection is taking new forms. Even over the internet we can sense and share in people's energies. A Wayist community might include:
- The meditation friend you've never met in person but who deeply understands your journey
- The local study group that meets in coffee shops rather than temples
- The online forum where authentic spiritual questions get explored without judgment
- The neighbors who share your garden and your spiritual discussions
- Even the non-human beings who share your living space and teach you daily wisdom
This isn't about creating another religion or institution. It's about recognizing and nurturing authentic connections wherever they emerge. Consider how different this is from traditional religious community:
**Religious Community | Wayist Community**
- Shared beliefs required | Shared growth supported
- Hierarchical structure | Natural connection
- Institutional loyalty | Authentic relationship
- Controlled interaction | Organic development
- Required participation | Natural engagement
Lord Jesus demonstrated this when he gathered communities around shared meals rather than in temples, taught in homes rather than religious institutions, and connected with anyone ready to grow regardless of their background. He showed that true spiritual community forms naturally around authentic connection and mutual support.
### In today's world, this might look like
- Virtual meditation groups that transcend geographic boundaries
- Local gathering spaces that welcome diverse paths
- Online platforms where deeper questions can be explored
- Informal networks of mutual support and learning
- Cross-cultural connections based on shared spiritual interest
The key is authenticity. A true spiritual community:
- Forms naturally without force
- Supports without controlling
- Shares without imposing
- Helps without interfering
- Grows without agenda
Watch out for warning signs of unhealthy community:
- Power hierarchies emerging
- Financial demands increasing
- Conformity being required
- Individual growth being stifled
- Exclusivity developing
Instead, look for:
- Natural mutual support
- Organic growth and change
- Flexible boundaries
- Authentic sharing
- Joy in connection
Remember: Even Lord Jesus didn't try to create a permanent community structure. He showed people how to connect authentically and then trusted them to find their way together. That's why Wayist communities can take so many forms - from online groups to local gatherings, from informal networks to temporary collaborations.
Most importantly, understand that you're already part of the largest community there is - the living universe itself. Every being, from the microbes in your gut to the stars in distant galaxies, is your neighbor on this cosmic journey. Learning to recognize and respect these connections is part of our evolution toward divine consciousness.
CHAPTER 59
## Living in the Light
### Spiritual Practice in the Age of Fulfillment
## Spiritual reality in a digital age
Remember when getting divine guidance meant going to a temple or church? Those days are over. You're living in the time Lord Jesus promised - when direct divine connection is available to everyone, everywhere, anytime. This isn't poetic metaphor - it's practical reality that transforms how we live in today's world.
Think about your typical day:
- Waking to smartphone alerts
- Racing through digital tasks
- Managing endless notifications
- Navigating information overload
- Handling constant connectivity
Now imagine overlaying this with divine awareness:
- Your morning routine becomes sacred practice
- Each digital interaction becomes conscious choice
- Every notification becomes an opportunity for presence
- Information flow becomes exercise in discernment
- Connectivity becomes reminder of divine presence
This isn't about escaping modern life - it's about engaging it consciously. When Lord Jesus promised to send divine guides to all humanity, he wasn't talking about some future supernatural event. He was describing exactly what's available now - direct spiritual guidance through your Divine Tara.
### Practical Application
#### In Your Digital Life
- Check in with your Tara before checking your phone
- Use technology breaks for spiritual connection
- Practice energy awareness during screen time
- Transform social media into mindfulness practice
- Make conscious choices about connectivity
#### At Work
- Start each task with divine awareness
- Transform challenges into growth opportunities
- Practice energy work during meetings
- Use breaks for spiritual renewal
-- See service opportunities everywhere
#### In Relationships
- Engage, with divine consciousness
- Practice energy awareness in interactions
- Transform conflicts into growth chances
- Maintain spiritual connection during conversations
- See the divine in everyone and everything, but people sometimes overshadow it with theit soul energies
- Don't engage people who do not reciprocate with good energy and who keep you from living the purpose of life, growing and maturing in spirit
#### The beauty is that you don't need
- Special conditions
- Religious settings
- Perfect circumstances
- Quiet environments
- Separate spiritual time
#### Divine reality is accessible
- During your commute
- In your workspace
- Through your challenges
- Amid your busyness
- Doing dishes or laundry
- In every moment
This is what Lord Jesus meant by 'the kingdom of heaven is within you.' He wasn't speaking metaphorically - he was describing the immediate availability of divine connection that we can access now, even in our complex modern lives.
The moment you stop treating divine connection as something to achieve and recognize it as your natural state, everything changes. Teresa of Avila, who faced the Spanish Inquisition for teaching direct spiritual experience, captures this revolutionary shift:
### "Enjoy Me"
> *What a burden I thought I was to carry --*
> *a crucifix, as did He.*
> *Love once said to me, "I know a song,*
> *would you like to hear it?"*
> 
> *And laughter came from every brick in the street*
> *and from every pore in the sky.*
> *After a night of prayer, He*
> *changed my life when He sang,*
> *"Enjoy Me."*
Like Lord Jesus teaching that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, Teresa discovered that divine reality isn't something to strive for - it's already here, waiting to be enjoyed.
The question isn't whether divine guidance is available - it's whether you're ready to engage with it consciously in your daily life. Every moment offers this opportunity, even (perhaps especially) in our digital age.
CHAPTER 60
## Sacred Art of Parenting
### Protecting the divine spark in a digital age
When Lord Jesus said we must become like children to enter heaven's kingdom, he wasn't suggesting childish behavior. He was pointing to something profound that our modern world seems determined to erase: Children naturally possess the spiritual qualities we spend lifetimes trying to recover.
Think about young children before society's programming takes hold:
- They live fully in the present moment
- They experience wonder at simple things
- They love without conditions
- They forgive instantly
- They sense energies naturally
- They communicate with divine realms easily
- They trust their intuition without doubt
Yet our modern world seems specifically designed to disconnect children from these natural qualities:
- Screens replace real experience
- Social media creates artificial values
- Education suppresses intuition for standardization
- Gaming substitutes virtual achievement for real accomplishment
- Cultural messaging confuses natural development
- Entertainment drowns out inner wisdom
- Technology mediates every experience
This is where conscious parenting becomes sacred duty. Your role isn't just raising successful children by society's standards - it's protecting their divine nature while they develop the strength to maintain it themselves.
### Modern Challenges Require Modern Solutions
For Screen Time:
- Create sacred tech-free spaces and times
- Balance virtual with real-world experience
- Teach conscious digital engagement
- Model healthy technology use
- Preserve direct human connection
For Social Media:
- Delay exposure as long as possible
- Teach energy awareness online
- Demonstrate authentic versus artificial connection
- Help navigate virtual relationships
- Protect natural self-worth
For Education:
- Balance institutional learning with spiritual wisdom
- Preserve intuitive knowledge alongside academic knowledge
- Maintain wonder while developing intellect
- Protect creativity from standardization
- Nurture natural gifts beyond academic metrics
For Family Life:
- Create home sanctuaries from digital chaos
- Establish sacred daily rhythms
- Maintain direct human connection
- Preserve natural spirituality
- Model authentic living
Remember: You're not just preparing children for material success - you're protecting developing divine beings. Every choice that preserves their natural connection to spirit, every stand against premature hardening of consciousness, every moment of authentic presence serves their spiritual evolution.
Practical Steps Include:
- Regular nature connection
- Family energy practices
- Sacred meal times
- Technology boundaries
- Conscious entertainment choices
- Protection of play and wonder
- Support for intuitive wisdom
- Authentic spiritual discussion
Most importantly, understand that conscious parenting isn't about perfection. It's about:
- Maintaining authentic connection
- Growing together spiritually
- Learning from challenges
- Protecting what's sacred
- Living wisdom daily
In a world increasingly hostile to natural spiritual development, this might be our most crucial task - preserving the divine spark in our children while they develop the strength to maintain it themselves.
CHAPTER 61
## Beyond Sacred Spaces
### Finding divine reality everywhere
Let me share a story that exposes religious hypocrisy in the starkest terms. Picture your local movie theatre on a Saturday night. People sit comfortably watching as actors scream "Lord Jesus Christ!" or "Oh my God!" as a curse word, mock God, and perform explicit violence and sex scenes that denigrate women and family structures - all while munching popcorn and calling it entertainment. Now imagine those exact same actions happening in their church the next morning. They'd be outraged, horrified, probably call the police. The church is just another theatre, another building, same actions - only their arbitrary designation of what's "sacred" has changed.
Now imagine those exact same actions and words happening in their home. Why is it embraced as entertainment in some pockets of one's life and not in others? Is it simply our ability to be super hypocrites or our willingness to go with popular narratives because we don't really have principles? Or is it just who we want to be? We must know these things -- its our task as Wayists to know why we do things.
This isn't just hypocrisy, to allow those things into some parts of our lives - it reveals how deeply we've been programmed to fragment our spiritual consciousness into artificial "sacred" and "secular" boxes. To be seen at church or doing recycling makes you a bit holier. To be seen at the movies, makes you a bit cooler. What is good for one building is not good for the other. People have been trained to think divine reality and our spirituality only exists in special buildings at specific times.
During the week, outside of church, the religion is, "business is business" and we can deceive and manipulate and vote for senators who steal and wage wars and decimate other people and countries because, "hey, that's who we Americans and UN people are, we terrorize the poor all over the world, causing untold misery, and deceive our own people" -- business is business.
Then on Sunday, it holy time again and we pay large sums to pastors for jets and mansions, and we send money to the Vatican, we feel justified in god's eyes because it is what the god of that religion likes -- the money and the double standards.
The Wayist, however, sees spirituality and divine reality in any place and situation. Doing it the Christian way, to separate divine space away from reality is like telling the air it can only exist in churches on Sunday mornings.
The Wayist would rather spend Sundays with family and friends because it's a day off work. Every day, every moment in every day is a spiritual time. So, Sundays are great for getting sun and good quality time with loved ones.
But there's an even darker reality here. The absence of Wayist churches isn't just about avoiding religious double standards - it's about protecting authentic spirituality from systems deliberately designed to destroy it. Look around: We're drowning in a culture that:
- Bombards us with ads telling us we're not good enough without their products
- Fills our minds with mindless entertainment to keep us spiritually unconscious
- Pushes us to consume rather than contemplate
- Replaces real human connection with artificial digital interaction
- Substitutes religious rituals for actual spiritual growth
This isn't random - it's systematic spiritual suppression. Think about it: A spiritually conscious population who Own Their Own Mind, who thinks for itself, is harder to control, harder to sell to, harder to manipulate. That's why Lord Jesus was killed - for showing people they could bypass the whole control system and connect directly with divine reality. He died for freedom of speech and freedom of owning your own mind. He was demonstrating holistic spiritual independence, and that made him dangerous to those in power.
The Wayist response isn't subtle - we don't build alternative churches, we build alternative consciousness. We develop what Lord Jesus actually taught - the ability to completely own our own minds. This Wayist principle isn't some vague spiritual concept. It means:
- Consciously examining every input into our consciousness: Is that TV show actually entertainment, or social programming? Is that news informing you or manipulating you? Is that social media connecting you or controlling you? Is the energy interfering in your goodness, or is it tainted with things you don't want in your insides, in your soul minds and spirit minds?
- Creating strong energy boundaries: Just as you wouldn't let a stranger walk into your house and rearrange your furniture, why let advertisers, media, or social pressure rearrange your mind? When someone tries to make you feel bad for not following the latest trend or buying the newest product, that's not just marketing - it's energy manipulation.
- Developing real spiritual connection: Your Divine Tara isn't some distant being you need special buildings or rituals to reach. They're more accessible than your smartphone, more reliable than your best friend, and more interested in your growth than any religious authority. But just like any relationship, this connection grows through actual engagement, not just believing it exists.
Consider how most people chase happiness. They're like hamsters on a wheel, running frantically toward:
- The next purchase that promises fulfilment

- The next achievement that's supposed to bring satisfaction

- The next experience that's meant to provide meaning

- The next relationship that should make everything perfect

- The next and the next ...
Meanwhile, the real source of joy and fulfilment is literally closer than their next breath. It's like dying of thirst while wearing a water backpack - the nourishment is right there, but you've been convinced to look everywhere else for it.
This is why Wayists focus on practical spiritual development rather than religious performance. We're not interested in looking spiritual - we're interested in being spiritually effective. That means:
- Developing actual energy awareness (not just talking about it)
- Creating genuine divine connection (not just believing in it)
- Taking real control of our consciousness (not just wishing for it)
- Living authentic spiritual truth (not just preaching about it)
Does this make us different? Absolutely. While others are chasing the latest spiritual trend or following religious routines, or attending spiritual club meetings, we're doing the practical work of spiritual evolution. We might look normal on the outside - we don't wear special clothes or perform obvious rituals - but our inner reality is radically different because:
- We consciously choose what influences our minds
- We maintain strong energetic boundaries
- We develop actual spiritual capabilities
- We live from genuine wisdom rather than social programming
- We resist unconscious manipulation while engaging fully with life
This isn't abstract philosophy - it transforms how you handle every situation. Let's get specific about what this looks like in real life:
**Morning News and Social Media**
While others mindlessly scroll through feeds designed to trigger emotional reactions, Wayists consciously engage:
- "Is this information I need, or manipulation I'm being fed?"
- "What's the energy behind this content trying to do to my consciousness?"
- "How is this affecting my mental state and spiritual focus?"
- "Do I really need to know about that latest outrage or celebrity drama?"
**At Work**
When your company pushes its "corporate culture" and team-building exercises, Wayists maintain clear boundaries:
- We can be excellent team players without surrendering our spiritual independence
- We can contribute fully while maintaining our energy boundaries
- We can succeed professionally without buying into materialistic values
- We can serve others without losing ourselves
**Entertainment Choices**
Instead of passively consuming whatever's popular, Wayists ask:
- "What's this doing to my consciousness?"
- "Is this actual entertainment or spiritual numbing?"
- "How will this affect my energy and awareness?"
- "Does this serve my evolution or hinder it?"
**Shopping and Advertising**
While others are hypnotized by marketing, Wayists maintain awareness:
- We see through "retail therapy" as spiritual manipulation
- We recognize artificial needs created by advertising
- We choose based on actual requirements, not manufactured desires
- We maintain conscious control of our resources
**Relationships**
Rather than following social scripts about connection, Wayists develop authentic relationships:
- We maintain energy boundaries while being genuinely close
- We share real wisdom instead of social expectations
- We support others' spiritual growth without controlling them
- We create true community without artificial structures
**Family and Social Pressure**
When family or friends push religious or social conformity, Wayists stay centred:
- We can love them without adopting their limitations
- We can respect their path while walking our own
- We can maintain connections without compromising consciousness
- We can share wisdom when asked without pushing our views
Even something as simple as eating becomes an opportunity for conscious living:
- We sense the energy of our food

- We maintain awareness during meals

- We choose nourishment consciously

- We recognize eating as spiritual practice
This might sound exhausting - constantly maintaining such awareness. But it's actually the opposite. Living unconsciously is what's exhausting. When you're clear about who you are and what you're here for, life becomes simpler. You stop wasting energy on things that don't serve your evolution. You naturally avoid spiritual junk food, whether it's toxic relationships, mindless entertainment, or empty materialism.
Remember: Lord Jesus didn't just teach nice ideas about love and peace. He demonstrated a radically different way of engaging with reality - one that was so threatening to the power structures of his time that they killed him for it. But they couldn't kill the truth he revealed: Real spiritual life isn't about special buildings, complicated scriptures, or religious performances. It's about developing the consciousness to engage directly with divine reality, right here, right now, in every moment and situation.
The stark truth is: Wayists and Christians are walking entirely different paths. While Christians enjoy the worship a god who delights in genocide and instructs devotees to take babies by their ankles and smash their heads on the rocks, and killing their dogs, enslave their daughters, wiping out a nation, Wayists cannot stomach that.
We know a different God our Father in Heaven and God our Mother in Heaven.
While Christians wait for salvation through belief, we're actively developing our divine nature. While they focus on religious rules and rituals, we're doing the practical work of spiritual evolution. While they build churches to contain the sacred, we're learning to recognize and work with divine reality everywhere.
We're not better - we're just pursuing a completely different goal. Christians seek to please their god through wars and worship and belief. We're working to become divine beings ourselves through conscious evolution and direct spiritual experience. They're focused on getting to heaven after death to serve that god. We're focused on developing the consciousness and capabilities we'll need when we get to our heaven to do the caring works of our Heaven.
This isn't about criticizing Judeo-Christianity - it serves many people well because they like what it stands for. But if you're feeling called to something deeper than religious observance, if you sense there's more to spiritual life than belief and worship, if you're ready to take genuine responsibility for your spiritual evolution - then you might be ready for the path Lord Jesus actually taught.
The choice is yours. You can continue with comfortable religious routine, or you can embrace the challenging but profound work of conscious spiritual development. You can accept what religious authorities tell you, or you can develop direct divine connection yourself. You can follow prescribed rules, or you can develop the wisdom to navigate reality consciously.
Whatever you choose, choose consciously. Your spiritual evolution is too important for anything less.
CHAPTER 62

*~ Jean Prieur du Plessis (1992)*
"But where is your Bible? Where is your church?" These are often the first questions people ask when exploring Wayism. The questions make perfect sense - after all, most of us have been taught that real spirituality requires special books, initiations, and designated buildings. The idea of spiritual life without these familiar anchors can feel unsettling, even frightening.
But consider this: Lord Jesus himself wrote no book and built no church. Instead, he taught in homes, marketplaces, and open fields. He pointed to flowers and birds to illustrate spiritual truth. He showed people how to connect directly with divine reality without needing religious structures or institutional permission. This wasn't accidental - it was central to his actual teaching.
Let's explore why Wayists need neither special books nor designated buildings - and how this freedom actually deepens authentic spiritual practice.
> The Way is difficult and very intricate.
> Lalla discarded her books that told
> about it, and through observation
> saw the truth that never comes
> to anyone from reading words.
*Lalleshwari (14th century Kashmir)*
## From Scripture to Living Wisdom
When Lord Jesus traveled through Asia teaching energy healing and spiritual transformation, he didn't hand out scripture or demand people memorize verses. Instead, he showed them how to experience divine reality directly. Why? Because real spiritual wisdom can't be confined to text - it must be lived to be understood.
Think about learning to swim. Reading a book about swimming techniques, memorizing the motions, even watching videos of expert swimmers - none of this actually teaches you to swim. Only getting in the water and experiencing it directly develops real swimming ability. Spiritual development works the same way.
This is why Wayists use Primary Teaching differently than Christians use the Bible. Primary Teaching isn't scripture to be worshipped or memorized - it's a practical guide for spiritual development. Like a good swimming manual, it explains the basics and offers guidance, but its real value comes through application, not just reading.
Consider these differences:
***Biblical Approach | Primary Teaching Approach***
- Memorize verses for spiritual merit | Apply principles for spiritual growth
- Find rules to follow | Develop wisdom to guide choices
- Seek answers in text | Find truth through experience
- Quote authority | Demonstrate understanding
- Interpret ancient writings | Live present wisdom
When you first approach Primary Teaching, you'll notice some striking differences from religious scripture:
- It focuses purely on spiritual development - no historical accounts, cultural rules, rituals, or religious laws
- It explains clearly why things work the way they do rather than demanding blind faith
- It encourages testing and direct experience rather than just believing
- It remains relevant across cultures and times because it deals with universal principles
- It serves as a guide to practice, not a source of doctrine
Most importantly, Primary Teaching shows you how to develop your own connection with divine wisdom. Instead of telling you what to think, it shows you how to grow in understanding. It's like having an experienced mentor who wants you to develop your own capabilities rather than remain dependent on their guidance.
## From Buildings to Direct Connection
The shift from designated "sacred spaces" to finding divine reality everywhere can feel even more challenging than the transition from scripture to living wisdom. After all, churches provide:
- Familiar spiritual routine
- Sense of community
- Structured practice times
- Shared spiritual experience
- Regular religious guidance
But consider what Lord Jesus actually demonstrated. He taught:
- In homes where people gathered naturally
- In marketplaces where daily life happened
- By lakeshores where people worked
- In gardens where life flourished
- On hillsides under open sky
This wasn't just because he lacked resources to build churches. He was showing us something profound: Divine reality can't be contained in buildings and we don't build houses for gods. The moment we designate certain spaces as "sacred," we unconsciously treat other spaces as "not sacred" - fragmenting our spiritual awareness and limiting our divine connection.
Instead of special buildings, Wayists develop the awareness to:
- Find sacred space anywhere
- Create spiritual atmosphere everywhere
- Connect with divine reality directly
- Practice in all situations
- Maintain constant spiritual presence
This doesn't mean you can't meditate in churches or enjoy beautiful spiritual spaces. But you're no longer dependent on them for divine connection. Every space becomes potentially sacred through your conscious presence.
## The Common Thread: Direct Experience
What connects these transitions - from scripture to living wisdom and from buildings to direct connection - is a profound shift from dependent to mature spirituality. Instead of needing:
- Religious authorities to interpret scripture for you
- Special buildings to connect with divine reality
- Designated times for spiritual practice
- Institutional permission for divine access
- External validation of your experience
You develop:
- Direct understanding through practice
- Constant divine connection
- Natural spiritual rhythm
- Immediate divine access
- Internal spiritual confidence
This isn't about rejecting all external support. Wayists often:
- Study with experienced practitioners
- Gather for shared practice
- Create beautiful meditation spaces
- Read inspiring spiritual works
- Share wisdom in community
But these support your direct spiritual experience rather than replacing it. They serve your growth rather than controlling it.
The key is understanding that authentic spirituality needs no intermediaries - not books, buildings, or religious authorities. Just as Lord Jesus taught, divine connection is your natural birthright. Everything else is just helpful tools for developing what's already within you.
This understanding transforms how you live. Every moment becomes potentially sacred. Every space offers opportunity for divine connection. Every experience provides material for spiritual growth. You're no longer dependent on external spiritual structures because you're developing the internal structures that truly matter.
Remember: Lord Jesus didn't tell people to build churches and write scripture. He showed them how to connect directly with divine reality wherever they were. That's not just history - it's an invitation to genuine spiritual freedom that's just as valid today as it was two thousand years ago.
## Finding Your Community
While Wayists don't need buildings for spiritual practice, we understand the value of genuine community connection. That's why we maintain an active online presence at Wayist.Life and other - not as a replacement for direct spiritual experience, but as a way to support each other's growth and share practical wisdom.
This vibrant community offers:
- Regular posts about authentic spiritual living
- Groups focused on practical skills like:
- Natural living and homesteading
- Conscious food preparation and preservation
- Traditional crafts and skills
- Nature connection practices
- Sharing of mystic poetry and wisdom
- Short courses on spiritual development
- Opportunities to serve and contribute
Unlike religious institutions that control from the top down, Wayist.Life and other Wayist communities encourage organic community growth. You can:
- Start your own discussion groups
- Share your unique wisdom and experience
- Connect with others walking similar paths
- Contribute your skills to keep the community thriving
- Help maintain this valuable resource for future seekers
Most importantly, this online gathering space reflects Wayist principles - it supports rather than controls, encourages rather than demands, and serves rather than commands. It's one more way we demonstrate that authentic spiritual community doesn't require religious institutions.
Remember: Just as Lord Jesus gathered communities naturally around shared meals and meaningful conversations, we gather in ways that make sense for our time while maintaining the same spirit of authentic connection and mutual support.
CHAPTER 63
## Finding Heaven in the Here and Now
### Sacred presence in everyday life
Lord Jesus's revolutionary understanding of divine presence wasn't confined to temples or special rituals. He taught that the sacred permeates our daily existence, waiting to be recognized in our most ordinary moments.
His Wayist teachings awakened a slumbering spiritual tradition in India called Bhakti. When the Bhati movement finally blossomed later on it reflected pure Wayism in an Indian dress, with cardamom and saffron flavours.
Lets look at how the Bhakti women mystics spoke to and of their deities (which we call Taras) by the intimate names they chose and in everyday settings. This reflects Wayism as we still experience it today -- but in the hands of Bhati poets known for their particular style (often shocking people) it has a peculiar beauty.
## The Kitchen as Temple
When Jesus took bread and wine - the most common elements of daily meals - and declared them sacred vehicles of divine presence, he wasn't creating a formal ritual but revealing how the divine infuses our everyday sustenance and how the presence of the divine is in all. This mirrors the profound understanding we find in Janabai's verses (1300 CE) where her kitchen becomes a temple and she has her deity whom she addresses as Vithoba doing her chores with her:
"*My maher is in Pandharpur,*
*That's where my Vithoba sweeps and scrubs,*
*Picks up my dirty clothes to wash,*
*And never lets me feel tired...*"
When Janabai declares "My maher is in Pandharpur," she's making a profound spiritual statement. Pandharpur is the sacred city where the temple of her Vitthal (Vithoba) is located. By claiming Pandharpur as her maher, she's saying that her true home, her place of ultimate comfort and freedom, is with God -- not this home in another city where she works as a slave. She imagines herself being there, in that *maher*, the ease of her maternal home (which does not exist for her).
This is especially powerful because Janabai was a low-caste servant - she likely didn't have a comfortable maternal home to return to. By claiming Pandharpur as her maher, she's transcending both her social status and conventional family structures, declaring a direct, intimate relationship with the divine that supersedes worldly relationships.
The line becomes even more revolutionary when followed by the image of her Vitthal doing household chores - the divine not only provides a spiritual home but takes on the role of a caring family member who shares her daily burdens.
For both Jesus and Janabai, the divine wasn't distant but intimately involved in life's most basic activities. The sacred meal Jesus shared wasn't separate from ordinary eating - it was a revelation of the holiness present in every meal, every moment of nourishment. The oiling of hair and washing of feet, all were healing, caring, intimate moments in which divinity is present because we make our awareness so.
## Divine Companionship
Jesus's promise "I am with you always," and "I will always walk among the community," reflects the same intimate divine companionship we find in Janabai's typical Bhakti shock verse:
*"My Vitthal follows me everywhere*
*Like a child holding its mother's sari*
*How can I forget him for a moment?"*
This understanding finds beautiful expression in the Wayist relationship with Tara - our divine guide and comforter who walks with us through every moment, whether we're feeding ducks at a pond or facing life's greatest challenges. Like a trusted friend, Tara is available for constant conversation, guidance, and companionship.
## Breaking Social Barriers
Just as Jesus shocked society by speaking with the Samaritan woman at the well, treating her as worthy of profound spiritual discourse, Janabai defied caste restrictions by claiming direct divine relationship. Mirabai similarly scandalized her high-caste family by dancing in the streets with common devotees and playing a street musician's instrument. All taught that divine communion isn't mediated by social status but available through direct relationship.
Here's one of Mirabai's defiant verses:
"*It's true I went to the market,*
*walked around in public.*
*Nobles, keep your distance---*
*your name is safe with me.*
*I sell the Name in the marketplace,*
*my prices are high.*
*Some pay for it with their lives,*
*some run when they hear what it costs.*
*Without my Beloved*
*I'll die.*
*This is my condition---*
*everyone knows it.*
*Mira's lord is the Mountain-Lifter:*
*she falls at his feet.*"
This poem is particularly powerful because Mirabai, a high-caste royal woman, is deliberately flouting social conventions. Going to the market alone was considered scandalous for a woman of her status. She refused to be wedded to another royal and be subject to their custom, therefore "This is my condition -- everyone knows it."
She transforms this act of social defiance into a metaphor for spiritual truth - she's "selling the Name" (divine love) in public, unconcerned with how it affects her family's reputation.
The line "Nobles, keep your distance" is an especially sharp jab at her aristocratic relatives who were horrified by her public devotion. She's essentially saying she doesn't care about their social standing or reputation - her relationship with Krishna takes precedence over all worldly concerns.
## Heaven in the Here and Now
When Jesus proclaimed "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand," and "The Kingdom of Heaven is within you," he pointed to what was also said in the Upanishads, "God is closer to you than your hand," and this then is also what the Bhakti mystics experienced - that divine reality isn't distant but immediate, present in every moment and activity. Whether it's:
- Jesus finding teaching moments in farmers sowing seeds
- Mirabai singing her love songs while doing household tasks
- Janabai turning her broom into a tool of devotion
- A Wayist walking with Tara through daily life
The message is consistent: heaven isn't elsewhere but here, waiting to be recognized in our most ordinary moments. Waiting for heaven to happen when you die is not the way to spiritual success.
This understanding transforms daily life from a series of mundane tasks into opportunities for divine communion. Every meal becomes a sacred meal, every conversation a chance for divine dialogue, every task a form of worship. As Jesus taught, the sacred isn't confined to special places or times but permeates all of existence, waiting for us to recognize its presence.
But what's particularly beautiful about both the Wayist approach to Tara and how the bhakti traditions developed it is how they directly embrace such natural, conversational intimacy. There's no separation between "sacred" and "ordinary" moments - everything becomes an opportunity for divine communion.
**Mira is Steadfast (by Mirabai)**
*I will not be restrained now, O Rana,*
*Despite all you do to block my path.*
*I have torn off the veil of worldly shame;*
*Only the company of Saints is dear to me.*
*Merta, my parents' home, I have left for good.*
*My surat and nirat, awakened,*
*Now shine bright.*
*My master has revealed to me*
*The mirror within my own body;*
*Now I'll sing and dance in ecstasy.*
*Keep to your self your gems and jewelry;*
*I have discarded them all, O Rana.*
*My true Lord I have come to behold;*
*None knows of this wealth within the body.*
*I fancy not your forts and palaces*
*Nor want silken robes wrought with gold.*
*Mira, unadorned and unbedecked,*
*Roams intoxicated in the Lord's love.*
CHAPTER 64
## Mystic Poets
### Write what we all experience
When Jesus declared "I am The Way," he wasn't merely describing a path to follow - he was expressing a profound mystical truth that echoes through the ages. From the earliest recorded spiritual experiences at the foundations of Wayism to modern times, mystics have consistently described a direct knowing that transcends ordinary consciousness, where the seeker and the sought become one.
This understanding appears in our earliest written records. Over four thousand years ago, an Egyptian mystic proclaimed "I am the All, I am Ra... I am Yesterday and I know Tomorrow," expressing this same realization of unity with divine reality. In ancient Sumer where the first Wayist writings happened*, the priestess Enheduanna wrote of her mystical communion: "With knowledge of you, I will live... you have chosen my heart," describing an intimate relationship with the divine that would be recognized by mystics throughout history.
**See our book, "Child of Enki..."*
These ancient voices begin our exploration of mystical experience across time and culture. As we'll see through the words of Rabia Basri's ecstatic love, Kabir's bold declarations, Meister Eckhart's stark proclamation "God and I are one," Julian of Norwich's revelations, Teresa of Avila's interior castle, Janabai's devotional poetry, and Sun Buer's alchemical insights - mystics across traditions have expressed this same truth through different lenses. Some, like Eckhart, state it with uncompromising directness, while others wrap it in poetry and metaphor, but all point to the same immediate, transformative knowing that transcends religious boundaries.
From the temple precincts of ancient Egypt to the medieval monasteries of Europe, from the marketplaces of India to the mountains of China, these voices weave a tapestry of testimony to humanity's capacity for direct spiritual knowing. Their experiences, separated by vast distances of time and space, reveal striking similarities that suggest they encountered the same fundamental reality - the very "Way" that Jesus embodied, proclaimed, and revived in many countries during his ministry.
Throughout history, souls have discovered what you're discovering now. Listen to their voices echoing across centuries, confirming the universal truth that Lord Jesus taught. Not through religious doctrine but through direct experience, they found what you're beginning to recognize.
Meister Eckhart speaks to our readiness
> *God is always ready,*
> *but we are very unready;*
> *God is near to us,*
> *but we are far from Him;*
> *God is within, but we are without;*
> *God is at home, but we are strangers.*
Rabia of Basra (Rabia Basri), a freed slave, woman alone, grew up in a Wayist home. She adapted her speech to live in an 8th century society experiencing a rapidly rising Islamic conquest. She bravely lived and survived as teacher and poet, as mystic and inspiration to others. She wrote in Farsi language. In this poem she shows us what happens when we break free from religious fear and resist pressure to convert to religions.
> *O God! If I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell,*
> *and if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise.*
> *But if I worship You for Your Own sake,*
> *grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty*
Juliana of Norwich, embedded in Christian context in the 1300s, came to Wayist conclusions that point to our true nature.
> *I it am.*
> *The greatness and goodness of the Father,*
> *I it am;*
> *the wisdom and kindness of the Mother,*
> *I it am.*
Julian was alive during 1381, when Norwich was overwhelmed by a Peasants' Revolt against abuses by Church and state during the Black Death which killed half of the population.
The Bishop of Norwich used Christian soldiers to defeat the uprising and executed their leaders who called for humanitarian reform of the Church, and some of them were burnt at the stake. Juliana was not afraid to pen her Wayist truth in those dangerous times.
Her works are the earliest surviving literary works of a woman in Europe.
## I Bet God
> If He
> let go of my hand, I would
> weep so loudly,
> I would petition with all my might, I would cause
> so much trouble
> that I bet God would come to His senses
> and never do that
> again.
*-- Meister Eckhart*
Eckhart died while under censure, accused of heresy by Christians for some of his works, especially for the Wayist teaching of the Almighty as creator *above* God our Mother and God our Father in Heaven.
## I have loved Thee with two loves
> I have loved Thee with two loves --
> a selfish love and a love that is worthy of Thee.
> As for the love which is selfish,
> Therein I occupy myself with Thee,
> to the exclusion of all others.
> But in the love which is worthy of Thee,
> Thou dost raise the veil that I may see Thee.
> Yet is the praise not mine in this or that,
> But the praise is to Thee in both that and this.
*-- Rabia al Basri*
## In My Spirit
> In my spirit
> there is a temple, a shrine, a mosque, a church
> where I kneel.
> Prayer should bring us to an altar where no walls or names exist.
> Is there not a region of love where the sovereignty is

> The nothing where ecstasy gets poured into itself
> and becomes lost,
> where the butterfly is fully alive
> but has no mind or body?
> In my spirit
> there is a temple, a shrine, a mosque, a church
> that dissolve, that dissolve in God.
*-- Rabia al Basri*
## Burn me in hell
> "O God! If I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell,
> and if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise.
> But if I worship You for Your Own sake,
> grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty
*-- Rabia al Basri*
### When pushed to convert, Rabia said of Prophet Muhammed
> "O prophet of god, few are there who does not love thee? But my love to God has so possessed me that no place remains for loving or hating any save God,"
*-- Rabia al Basri*
## Laughter Came from Every Brick
> Just these two words He spoke
> changed my life,
> "Enjoy Me."
> What a burden I thought I was to carry --
> a crucifix, as did He.
> Love once said to me, "I know a song,
> would you like to hear it?"
> And laughter came from every brick in the street
> and from every pore in the sky.
> After a night of prayer, He
> changed my life when He sang,
> "Enjoy Me."
*-- Teresa of Avila*
Theresa was not known as a Wayist but she had certainly matured into one.
## About True Seekers

> Set fire to reason
> and flare into a mad lover.
> If you hesitate over this alchemy,
> at least come and take a quick look.
> How long will you stay in your head?
> Become like me, leave your lower-self.
> For once, show foresight
> so that in the end you too can become
> a dervish and joyfully arrive
> at annihilation of the old self.
> I who am neither myself nor other than myself
> have traveled beyond reason, good and evil thoughts.
> I've lost my lower-self within myself.
> The only cure is the incurable.
> When the sun of poverty landed on me,
> both worlds twirled together into a single shaft of light.
> And when I saw that column of light
> I passed on into spirit; became
> a drop of water and joined the stream.
> All that I had won and lost,
> I threw away into black waters.
> I disappeared, became lost, void.
> I became a shadow without a single atom,
> a drop of water that had joined the ocean.
> Good luck finding that droplet.
> Such loss of self is not for all,
> but I joined the eternal union
> and there are many like me.
> Who in the world, from a dust mote to the moon,
> wouldn't want to be lost this way?
-by Farid ud-Din Attar (1200s embedded in Sufism)
## How long then will you seek for beauty here?

## The Holy Water
In The Holy Water, Rabia al Basri explores when she realized how it is that God the Father and God the Mother of Heaven exist within the Divine Realm of The Almighty.
*No one lives outside the walls of this sacred place, existence. *
*The holy water, I need it upon my eyes: it is you, dear, you -- each form. *
*What mother would lose her infant -- and we are that to God, *
*never lost from Her gaze are we? Every cry of the heart *
*is attended by light's own arms. *
*You cannot wander anywhere that will not aid you. *
*Anything you can touch -- Divine Law brought it into *
*the classroom of your mind. *
*Differences exist, but not in the city of love. *
*Thus my vows and yours, I know they are the same. *
*I have just peeled the skin from the potato *
*and you are still contemplating its worth, *
*sweetheart; indeed there are wonderful nutrients in all, *
*for Almighty made everything. *
*You joined our community at birth. *
*With your Father being who He is, what do the *
*world's scales know of your precious value. *
*The priest and the prostitute -- they weigh the same before the Son's *
*immaculate being, *
*but who can bear that truth and freedom, *
*so a wise man adulterated the *
*scriptures; *
*every wise man knows this. *
*My soul's face has revealed its beauty to me; *
*why was it shy so long, didn't it know how this made me suffer *
*and weep? *
*A different game the Lord plays with the close ones. *
*God tells us truths you would not believe, *
*for most everyone needs to limit the Lord's compassion; concepts of *
*right and wrong preserve the golden seed *
*until one of the Lord's friends comes along and tends your body *
*like a divine bride. *
*A holy one sent out a surveyor to find the limits of Its compassion *
*and being. *
*Almighty knows a divine frustration whenever he acts like that, *
*for the Infinite has *
*no walls. *
*Why not take God up about this? *
*Why not accept the freedom of what it means *
*for our Lord to see us *
*as becoming like Himself. *
* So magnificently sovereign is our Lover; never say, *
*'On the other side of this river a different King rules." *
*For how could that be true -- for nothing can oppose Infinite strength. *
* No one lives outside the walls of this sacred place, existence. *
* The holy water my spirit's brow needs, is unity. *
*Love opened my eye and I was cleansed *
*by the purity of each*
*form.*
## My Greatest Need is You

## Favor and disgrace are meaningless
In Favor and Disgrace Wu Cailan explores how societal values are soul-things and do not affect us because we keep the spirit pure.
> Favor and disgrace are meaningless -

## Precious Treatise on Preservation of Unity on the Great Way
*The Way is uncontrived, yet there is nothing it does not do.*
*It can be awared by the spirit, not known by soul knowledge.*
*What is "knowing"? What is "awared"?*
*Wisdom dismisses knowledge.*
*Awared only responds.*
*Response comes from nowhere.*
*Spirit then penetrates.*
*Penetrate the Heaven, and all tasks are done.*
*The Heaven is the root.*
*The task is the door.*
*When the task returns to Heaven, the Heaven is ever present.*
*The presence should not be reified;*
*provisionally we speak of keeping it.*
*Keep open selflessness and naturally be eternal.**
*-by Sun Buer*
*Keep ideas of ego open to change, be aware of spirit and the spirit realm within and without, become authentically your true self, become immortal.
Buer was a Chinese Wayist monk and teacher in the 12 century

*perhaps the same one who gave a radiance to you*
*in your mother's womb.*
*Is it logical you would be walking around entirely*
*orphaned now?*
**
*The truth is you turned away yourself,*
*and decided to go into the dark alone.*
*Now you are tangled up in others, and have forgotten*
*what you once knew,*
*and that's why everything you do has some weird*
*failure in it.*
*~ Kabir (1500 CE, India)*
These aren't just beautiful words. They're confirmations that what Lord Jesus taught is universally true, discovered again and again by those who dare to look beyond religious constraints to direct divine reality. Wayism is replete with mystical poems of saints and sages from all walks of life, embedded and all spiritual traditions. The freedom to worship as you wish is a rare jewel, a privilege in fact.
The invitation remains open. The path is clear. The journey continues.
Your Divine Tara awaits your conscious recognition. Your divine nature awaits your awakening. The wisdom you need will develop naturally through experience. Everything else is just detail.
Welcome to theWAY. You've always been on it - now you're simply walking it consciously.
CHAPTER 65
## Shared Celebrations
### Sacred times in community
While Wayists know that every moment is sacred, we joyfully participate in seasonal celebrations that connect us with family, friends, and the wider community. Two major observances we share with our Christian neighbors deserve special mention - not because the dates themselves are significant, but because they offer beautiful opportunities for shared celebration and deeper meaning.
## Easter: Renewal and Revolutionary Truth
For Wayists, spring's renewal perfectly frames our remembrance of Lord Jesus demonstrating humanity's greatest truth - that death is not an ending but a transition, and spiritual liberation is our natural birthright. While Christians focus on sacrifice and salvation, we celebrate:
- The natural cycles of renewal and rebirth
- The triumph of direct spiritual truth over institutional control
- The demonstration of reincarnation's reality
- The season's reminder that life springs eternal
We happily join the Pagan and Christian Easter egg hunts and family gatherings while holding our deeper understanding of what Lord Jesus actually proved by returning - that death need not be feared and spiritual freedom requires no institutional permission.
## Christmas: Light in Darkness
Though historical records suggest Lord Jesus was born in September, we gladly participate in December's celebrations of light and togetherness. For us, the holidays of Diwali and Christmas run together in a celebration of the December solstice for northerners, when the coming of more light is celebrated. While Christians commemorate their savior's birth, we celebrate:
- Divine wisdom taking human form to teach humanity
- The universal light that shines in all traditions
- The natural symbolism of light returning to darkness
- The joy of family and community connection
We can mindfully exchange gifts and share festive meals while maintaining our focus on what Lord Jesus actually brought - practical teachings about humanity's divine potential.
## The Art of Shared Celebration
This ability to participate in cultural celebrations while holding our own deeper understanding is part of Wayist wisdom. We don't need to reject or correct others' interpretations - we simply add our own layer of meaning while joining the community's natural rhythms.
This allows us to:
- Maintain family bonds across different beliefs
- Build bridges between traditions
- Share joy without compromising truth
- Keep community connections strong
Remember: For Wayists, the power isn't in the date but in the meaning we bring to it. We can celebrate these times with authentic joy while quietly holding our profound understanding of what Lord Jesus actually taught and demonstrated.
This approach transforms potentially divisive religious holidays into opportunities for genuine connection - a gift that serves both our own spiritual path and our wider human community.
CHAPTER 66
## Finding Your Path:
### Transitioning to theWAY
Imagine discovering that the training wheels you've been using aren't actually part of the bicycle. They served their purpose - helping you find your balance, giving you confidence, keeping you from falling while you learned. But now you're ready to ride freely, to experience the full joy of cycling as it was meant to be. That's what transitioning to theWAY feels like for many people.
This isn't about rejecting your religious background - it's about recognizing that you've outgrown it. Like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, you're not denouncing your caterpillar phase. You're simply ready for the next stage of your evolution. This natural progression from soul-consciousness to spirit-consciousness happens when you're ready, not before.
Many who find themselves drawn to theWAY describe it as remembering something they've always known but somehow forgot. Whether you're coming from a Christian church, Hindu temple, Muslim mosque, or no religious background at all, you're likely discovering that the mystics from all traditions have been describing this same journey. Rumi wasn't just being poetic when he wrote about dropping the names of religions to find direct truth. Meister Eckhart wasn't being heretical when he spoke of finding God beyond church doctrine. They were pointing to the same reality that you're discovering now - direct spiritual connection transcends religious frameworks.
The only thing blocking divine connection is our own lack of recognition. This isn't about divine beings being distant or difficult to reach - it's about our own readiness to experience what's already here. Meister Eckhart, with his characteristic directness, puts it perfectly:
> *God is always ready,*
> *but we are very unready;*
> *God is near to us,*
> *but we are far from Him;*
> *God is within, but we are without;*
> *God is at home, but we are strangers.*
This isn't about religious guilt but practical reality. Like Lord Jesus saying, 'the kingdom of heaven is within you,' Eckhart is pointing out that divine connection isn't something to achieve - it's something to recognize.
This transition brings both liberation and challenges. Some feel immediate relief, like finally taking off shoes that were too tight. Others experience anxiety about leaving familiar structures, even when they know it's time. Both responses are perfectly natural. Remember: You're not losing anything real - you're gaining direct access to what religion could only point toward.
For those coming from Christian backgrounds, you might wonder what to do with your Bible. Some celebrate ceremonially setting it aside, while others prefer to keep it as a record of their journey, recognizing the universal wisdom hidden within its pages while no longer seeing it as absolute authority. There's no single right way. What matters is being honest with yourself about what serves your growth now.
> *To learn the scriptures is easy,*
> *to live them, hard.*
> *The search for the Real*
> *is no simple matter.*
> *Deep in my looking,*
> *the last words vanished.*
> *Joyous and silent,*
> *the waking that met me there.*
*Lalleshwari*
Similarly, if you have a Hindu shrine with Krishna, Muslim prayer beads, or Catholic icons that still resonate with your heart, there's no need to discard them. These symbols can serve as reminders of divine reality without becoming objects of worship. The key is understanding them as fingers pointing to the moon, not the moon itself.
## Creating New Rhythms
If you've been part of a religious community, you might find yourself wondering what to do with Sunday mornings now, or missing the structured times of prayer or meditation. This is where something beautiful happens - you get to create rhythms that actually serve your spiritual evolution rather than following prescribed schedules.
Think of it this way: Instead of attending services where someone else directs your spiritual experience, you're learning to sense and follow the natural rhythms of your own spiritual development. This might mean:
- Meditating when you feel naturally drawn to silence
- Studying theWAY Primary Teaching when you're genuinely hungry for wisdom
- Creating sacred space in your home that reflects your authentic path
- Connecting with your Divine Tara throughout the day, not just at set times
- Finding joy in spontaneous spiritual practice
## The Living Connection
Perhaps the biggest shift is understanding that you don't need intermediaries between you and divine reality. That direct connection was always there - religion just convinced you that you needed help accessing it. Now you're discovering that:
- Your Divine Tara is always present, no permission needed
- Wisdom flows naturally when you're ready to receive it
- Sacred moments happen anywhere, not just in designated buildings
- Growth comes through living consciously, not following rules
- Divine connection is your natural state, not something to earn
## Finding Your Community
One concern many people express is losing their spiritual community. But here's what often happens instead - you start attracting fellow travelers who are also ready for direct spiritual experience. These connections tend to be more authentic because they're based on genuine spiritual resonance rather than shared beliefs.
This might look like:
- Informal study groups meeting in coffee shops
- Online connections with others walking theWAY
- Deep conversations with people from various backgrounds who recognize the same truth
- Natural gatherings for meditation or energy work
- Sharing wisdom across traditional religious boundaries
## Sacred Study
theWAY Primary Teaching serves differently than religious scripture. Instead of mixing spiritual wisdom with historical accounts, antiquated cultural rules, and various interpretations, it offers direct guidance for spiritual evolution. Think of it as a manual for developing your divine nature rather than a book of religious rules.
You'll likely find yourself drawn to mystics from various traditions who all point to the same reality:
- Rumi's ecstatic poetry about divine love
- Lalleswari's insights about direct spiritual experience
- Meister Eckhart's teachings about finding God beyond religion
- Kabir's wisdom about transcending religious divisions
- The practical guidance of contemporary teachers
## For Those Called to Guide Others
Some find themselves naturally drawn to helping others navigate this transition. If you feel called to this service, remember:
- Focus on practical wisdom rather than creating new doctrine
- Help others find their direct connection rather than depending on you
- Study theWAY Primary Teaching until its wisdom becomes your own
- Learn from mystics across traditions to recognize universal truth
- Develop skills to support others without creating dependency
Remember: You're not leaving truth behind - you're moving closer to it. You're not losing connection - you're discovering how direct it can be. You're not rejecting wisdom - you're maturing into deeper understanding. This isn't about less spirituality, but about more authentic spirituality.
The path ahead isn't always easy, but it's profoundly rewarding. Every step toward more direct spiritual experience, every moment of genuine connection, every insight that arises from your own development confirms that you're moving in the right direction. Welcome to the journey you've actually been on all along - now you're just walking it consciously.
## Navigating Common Challenges
Let's talk honestly about some situations you might face:
### Family Dynamics
Many people find their biggest challenge isn't internal but relational. When you stop attending religious services or question traditional beliefs, family members might react with anything from concern to outright hostility. Here's what helps:
- Remember: Their reaction often comes from love and fear
- You don't need to defend or explain your evolution
- Keep demonstrating through your life that you're growing, not lost
- Focus on shared values rather than theological differences
- Give them time to adjust to the new you
### Internal Struggles
Even when you're clear about your path, old programming can surface:
- Ingrained guilt about questioning religious authority
- Fear of divine punishment (especially during challenges)
- Uncertainty without rigid rules to follow
- Doubt when facing life's big questions
- The urge to create new religious structures
These reactions are normal - they're just old patterns dissolving. Instead of fighting them, observe them with compassion while continuing to develop your direct spiritual connection.
### The Authenticity Challenge
One of the biggest tests is maintaining authentic spirituality without falling into familiar religious patterns. Watch for:
- The temptation to turn Wayist teachers into gurus
- The temptation to follow charismatic teachers because of the 'cult of personality' trap
- Looking for absolute answers rather than developing wisdom
- Seeking approval for your spiritual insights or practice
- Trying to convert others instead of simply sharing your experience
### Practical Matters
Then there are everyday situations that need practical navigation:
- How to handle religious holidays with family
- What to do about religious ceremonies (weddings, funerals)
- Explaining your path to curious friends
- Dealing with workplace religious assumptions
- Finding new ways to mark life's significant moments
The key is remembering that you can honor others' paths while walking your own. You don't need to reject everything about your previous religious experience - just transform what still serves into more authentic expression.
### Creating New Support Systems
As you move beyond religious structures, it's important to develop natural support for your spiritual evolution:
- Find or create spaces for authentic spiritual discussion
- Connect with others who understand direct spiritual experience
- Develop practices that genuinely serve your growth
- Learn to trust your inner guidance
- Build relationships based on shared spiritual awareness rather than seeking someone in your grade. Because even if you do find such a person there are nuances in grades and relationship is much, much, more than only spiritual insight.
Remember: You're not alone on this journey. Throughout history, souls have reached this same point of evolution - ready to move beyond religious frameworks into direct spiritual experience. Many of humanity's greatest teachers and mystics walked this very path.
The challenges you face aren't signs that something's wrong - they're natural parts of spiritual evolution. Each one serves your development, helping you strengthen your direct connection and deepen your authentic wisdom.
### Sacred Spaces Everywhere
One of the most liberating aspects of walking theWAY is realizing that divine connection isn't limited to designated holy places. Yet there's also profound beauty in recognizing that anywhere humans have sincerely reached toward divine reality can hold special energy.
Think about walking into an ancient cathedral, a quiet Hindu temple, or a small roadside shrine. You can feel the accumulated energy of countless prayers, meditations, and sacred moments. It's as if the very stones have absorbed the spiritual aspirations of generations. As a Wayist, you're of course free to:
- Meditate in a Catholic church's peaceful atmosphere
- Visit Hindu temples to absorb their sacred vibrations
- Sit quietly in Buddhist meditation halls
- Find solitude in forest shrines
- Create sacred space wherever you are
The difference is that you're not bound to any of these places or traditions. You're free to recognize and receive what serves spiritual growth while maintaining your direct divine connection anywhere.
### Cultural Richness Without Religious Bondage
Wayists around the world have developed beautiful traditions over centuries, drawing from various cultures. You might find yourself naturally drawn to:
- Celebrating Three Kings Day with its deep symbolism
- Observing traditional Tara days for focused spiritual connection
- Incorporating meaningful elements from various cultural celebrations
- Using ancient prayers that resonate with your heart
- Practicing traditional meditations from different lineages
The key is understanding that these are optional cultural expressions, not religious requirements. Like enjoying music from different cultures, you can appreciate and participate in these traditions without being bound by them. They're tools for enriching your spiritual practice, not rules to follow.
## Finding Your Own Way
Some Wayists maintain elaborate home shrines with statues, incense, and traditional offerings. Others prefer a simple meditation cushion in a quiet corner. Some gather for group practices on traditional holy days, while others follow their own organic rhythms.
The beauty is that all these approaches are equally valid when they serve authentic spiritual growth.
**This freedom to choose what resonates extends to**
- Prayer and meditation styles
- Sacred symbols and images
- Spiritual celebrations and observances
- Community connections
- Personal practice rhythms
Remember: Using traditional forms or choosing simplicity isn't about being a "better" Wayist - it's about what genuinely supports your spiritual evolution at this stage of your journey.
CHAPTER 67
## The Beautiful Simplicity of theWAY
### Everything you need to know
When Lord Jesus taught along the ancient trade routes, he wasn't handing out scripture or demanding people memorize doctrine. He was pointing to something so fundamentally simple that you already know it deep in your soul. It's like remembering something you've always known but somehow forgot.
Here's the entire teaching of theWAY in its beautiful simplicity:
-   You are a soul who chose to come to this school of divinity for souls; you're here to evolve into an immortal divine being
-   Earth is your classroom, each human life a semester of learning
-   You have a Divine Tara guiding you perfectly
-   Your purpose is to grow in wisdom through experience; live life deeply and widely with joy and awe
-   The three core powers - humility, simplicity, and compassion - will naturally develop as you evolve
That's it. Everything else is just elaboration and practical application of these basic truths. Think about how this simplicity protects the teaching:
- Anyone can understand it
- Everyone can recognize it
- No interpretation needed
- No authority required
- No complex theology necessary
When someone tries to complicate this teaching or add their own rules, it stands out immediately - like a sour note in a simple melody. The very simplicity of theWAY guards its authenticity.
CHAPTER 68
## The Living Waters
### Ancient wisdom for modern practice
Among all spiritual traditions, Wayism stands unique in its simplicity - we maintain just one ritual, one daily practice that unites all Wayists across the world. This is the Dayspring practice, our sacred morning connection with water. While our spiritual paths may vary according to our individual needs and development, this one simple ritual joins us in common purpose and understanding.
When Lord Jesus told his students they must be "born of water and spirit," he wasn't talking about religious baptism - he was pointing to something far more profound. Unlike other traditions that mandate multiple rituals, ceremonies, and observances, Wayism recognizes that authentic spirituality flows naturally from within. The Dayspring practice serves as our sole external ritual, a practical tool for spiritual renewal and conscious living that transcends cultural and personal differences.
Think about it: Water exists in four forms - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Like divine reality itself, it transcends simple categories and demonstrates transformation. This wasn't lost on Lord Jesus, who used water not just for "baptism" as Christians later interpreted it, but as a practical means for spiritual development.
## The Sacred Morning Waters: The Dayspring Practice
Your first encounter with water each morning through the Dayspring practice isn't just about hygiene - it's a conscious act of spiritual renewal. That mindful splash of cool water on your face serves multiple purposes:
- Clears residual energies from night's spiritual work
- Resets your Ajna (third eye) center for the day ahead
- Physically and energetically prepares you for conscious living, grounding in the purpose of life for the day ahead
This isn't about religious ritual but practical spiritual technology. Lord Jesus demonstrated the Dayspring practice through his own morning routines by rivers and lakes, showing how to use water mindfully rather than religiously.
## Beyond the Dayspring: Water's Wider Wisdom
While the Dayspring practice forms our essential morning ritual, water's spiritual teachings extend throughout our day. When Lord Jesus spoke of "living water," he wasn't being merely poetic. The Wayist understands that mindful interaction with water in all forms:
- Cleanses body and energy systems
- Maintains vital force
- Connects us to life's basic rhythms
- Teaches natural balance through its feedback
## Sacred Service: Sharing the Flow
Remember how Lord Jesus often taught near water sources? This wasn't coincidence. Water hold energetic memory and natural water sources have beautiful natural energies that are readily accessible to humans. Wayists understand that sharing water mindfully:
- Expresses practical compassion
- Acknowledges our connection with all life
- Demonstrates natural generosity
- Participates in life's essential flow
## Evening Practice: Sacred Cleansing
When Lord Jesus spoke of cleansing, he wasn't talking about ritualistic purification but practical energy work. The Wayist evening water practice is profound in its simplicity:
Think of your daily shower or bath not just as physical cleaning but as energy reset. As water flows over you, visualize:
- The day's accumulated stress washing away
- Unwanted energies flowing down the drain
- Your aura being cleansed and refreshed
- Your system resetting for rest and renewal
This isn't magical thinking - it's practical energy management using water's natural properties. We know from physics that water has unique molecular properties that respond to energy and intention. The Wayist simply works consciously with these natural qualities.
## Working with Water's Energy
Here's something fascinating that didn't make it into Christian scripture: Beyond the Dayspring practice, Lord Jesus taught additional ways of working with water's energy, including what we now call "sun water" - water energetically charged by sunlight. This isn't about supernatural transformation but natural energy enhancement:
## The Sacred Sun Water
Here's something fascinating that didn't make it into Christian scripture: Lord Jesus taught a practice of preparing what we now call "sun water" - water energetically charged by sunlight. This isn't about supernatural transformation but natural energy enhancement:
- Place pure water in a clear glass container
- Allow it to absorb sunlight for several hours
- Use this energetically enhanced water for:
- Cleansing sacred spaces
- Resetting energy in objects
- Supporting spiritual practice
- Enhancing meditation spaces
## Water Wisdom for Modern Life
This profound understanding of water's spiritual properties explains many "miraculous" elements in Lord Jesus' teaching that religion later misinterpreted:
- His "walking on water" demonstrated energetic mastery and use of water's different states
- His "turning water to wine" showed transformation of energy through intention
- His participating in the "baptism" of his cousin John was a teaching about spiritual cleansing, energy work, not religious ritual. A way to re-interpret religious dogma and rite
- His teaching by rivers and seas wasn't just about convenient gathering places
Today's Wayist maintains this ancient wisdom while adapting to modern challenges:
- We advocate for clean water as spiritual practice
- We oppose unnecessary chemical treatment of water and we resist drinking water from artificial containers
- We work to protect water sources for all beings
- We maintain mindful water practice in urban settings
## Beyond Religious Ritual
Unlike Christian baptism which happens once, or ritual washing which follows rigid rules, the Wayist water practice is:
- Daily and natural
- Personally meaningful
- Practically effective
- Spiritually authentic
This isn't about supernatural transformation or religious symbolism. It's about working consciously with one of nature's most profound teachers. When Lord Jesus taught these practices, he was showing something far more revolutionary than religious ritual - he was demonstrating practical spiritual technology that anyone can use.
## Living the Practice
Above all, remember that water isn't just a spiritual tool - it's the essence of life itself. Every cell in your body, every plant reaching toward the sun, every creature that walks or flies or crawls depends on this remarkable substance. When we work consciously with water, we're connecting to the very foundation of life on Earth. A Wayist's respect for water goes beyond spiritual practice - it's recognition of our complete dependence on this incredible gift. This deepens our commitment to keeping water clean and available for all beings, knowing that in serving water, we serve life itself.
In your daily life, this might look like:
- Starting each day with mindful face-washing
- Drinking water with conscious appreciation
- Sharing water mindfully with plants and animals
- Using evening bathing as spiritual practice
- Preparing sun water for sacred space cleansing
Remember: While religions later turned water practices into rigid rituals, the original teaching - preserved in our Dayspring practice and other mindful water work - was about practical spiritual development. Water isn't holy because of religious blessing - it's sacred by its very nature and powerful in its practical application for spiritual growth.
This is why Lord Jesus often taught near water sources - not for symbolic reasons but because water itself is one of our greatest spiritual teachers. From the morning Dayspring practice to our final evening cleansing, every interaction with water becomes an opportunity for conscious evolution when we understand its true significance.
The beauty of these practices, especially the essential Dayspring ritual, lies in their elegant simplicity. You don't need special equipment, religious authority, or supernatural beliefs. You just need water, awareness, and intention - exactly as Lord Jesus originally taught.
CHAPTER 69
## Go Beyond Religion
### The Living Path
When Lord Jesus walked the ancient trade routes between Egypt and India, he wasn't starting a religion. He was demonstrating something far more revolutionary - a practical path of spiritual evolution available to every human soul. Two thousand years later, his actual teaching remains as relevant and transformative as ever, perhaps even more so in our time of global awakening and spiritual seeking.
#### Think about what we've discovered through this exploration
- Instead of a fallen sinner needing salvation, you're a divine being in training
- Rather than requiring religious permission, you have direct access to divine guidance
- Instead of following religious rules, you can develop natural wisdom
- Rather than fearing divine punishment, you can understand karma as education
- Instead of waiting for heaven after death, you can develop divine consciousness now
This isn't about believing the right things or following religious rules. It's about something far more profound - actually transforming your consciousness through direct spiritual experience. When Lord Jesus said "You will know the truth, and the truth shall set you free," he wasn't talking about accepting religious doctrine. He was pointing to the liberation that comes from experiencing divine reality directly.
Consider how this transforms everything
- Prayer becomes conscious communion rather than pleading for favors
- Service flows naturally rather than from obligation
- Growth happens through experience rather than belief
- Wisdom develops from within rather than being imposed from without
- Divine connection becomes your natural state rather than something to achieve
Most importantly, understand that you're not starting something new - you're recognizing the path you've already been walking, perhaps unconsciously until now. Every experience, every challenge, every joy and sorrow has been preparing you for this conscious engagement with your spiritual evolution.
The question isn't whether you're ready - your very interest in these teachings suggests you are. The question is: Are you willing to engage with life more consciously, to develop your divine capacities more deliberately, to walk your path with greater awareness?
#### You don't need
- Religious conversion
- Special initiation
- Complex rituals
- Institutional approval
- Perfect circumstances
#### You simply need
- Willingness to grow
- Openness to guidance
- Commitment to practice
- Patience with process
- Trust in your journey
Remember: Lord Jesus didn't teach religion - he demonstrated direct spiritual connection. He didn't demand worship - he showed what we can become. He didn't create a system of beliefs - he offered a path of transformation.
This path remains open to all who are ready to walk it. Your Divine Tara awaits your conscious recognition. Your divine nature awaits your awakening. The wisdom you need will develop naturally through experience. Everything else is just detail.
The journey continues. Welcome to theWAY. You've always been on it - now you're simply walking it consciously.
#### As you move forward
- Trust your direct experience
- Develop your divine capacities
- Serve with growing wisdom
- Live authentically and fully
- Remember your divine nature
Lord Jesus showed us this path not as some distant ideal but as our natural heritage. Every step you take toward conscious spiritual development brings you closer to realizing what he demonstrated - that divine consciousness isn't something to achieve but something to recognize and develop within yourself.
The invitation remains open. The path is clear. Your journey of conscious evolution begins now.
Welcome home.

## POSTSCRIPT
## Common Questions About Walking theWAY
## 'What is the ideal Wayist man, and Wayist woman like?'
### The Ideal Wayist Man
Takes his example from Lord Iesous - a being of both strength and tenderness. He is a dignified man who carries himself with quiet power, not from position or authority but from inner cultivation. His intellect is sharp but tempered by compassion; his self-restraint comes not from rigid control but from deep understanding. He exudes wisdom gained through living life fully and remaining eternally curious about existence.
He is a keen observer of life in all its forms - watching how birds build nests, how trees weather storms, how children play without pretense. He sees the divine dancing in all things. Slow to judge others but quick to examine himself, he prioritizes continuous self-development while maintaining humility about his progress.
Joy flows naturally from him - he laughs easily and plays with childlike wonder, yet carries himself with mature grace. He forms deep bonds with nature's beings, considering them his teachers and friends, while being selective and authentic in human relationships. His protection of family comes not from possessiveness but from wise love that helps others grow strong.
He cultivates wealth in all its forms - wisdom, compassion, skill, relationships, and sometimes material abundance - but remains unattached to possessions. He appreciates the authentic and time-tested, finding beauty in worn wooden bowls and wrinkled faces. As a teacher and father, he prepares loved ones not just to survive but to thrive, imparting both practical skills and spiritual wisdom.
He protects his loved ones with his life, never speaks bad of them to others, respects them and keeps them in line so they will enjoy the respect of society and as a team they work together to get through this life.
### The Ideal Wayist Woman
Takes her example from Mari of Magadha - a being who transformed suffering into boundless compassion. She carries herself with quiet dignity born not of social position but of self-knowledge. Her strength flows from having faced life's darkest corners yet emerging with light in her heart.
She is a discerning woman who sees through illusion to truth, having learned to trust her inner knowing. Her intellect is keen but balanced by deep intuition; her power comes not from control but from understanding the flow of life's energies. She has learned to dance with both shadow and light, finding wisdom in all experiences.
Her compassion runs deep but is tempered by wisdom - she knows when to nurture and when to challenge, when to comfort and when to step back. She carries herself with natural grace that comes from self-acceptance rather than external validation. Her joy bubbles up from an inner wellspring, untainted by life's hardships.
She forms profound connections with others while maintaining healthy boundaries, having learned the delicate balance between giving and preserving herself. Her protection of those in her care comes from wisdom rather than fear. She teaches through example as much as through words, showing others how to transform their wounds into wisdom.
Like Mari, she understands that true power lies not in domination but in the capacity to remain open-hearted despite life's challenges. She cultivates beauty in all its forms - in relationships, in creative expression, in daily acts of kindness. Her wealth lies in her ability to find light in darkness and to help others do the same.
She walks between worlds with grace - equally at home in contemplation or celebration, in solitude or community. She knows that the divine feminine expresses itself not just in nurturing but also in fierce protection of what is true and good. As a teacher and guide, she helps others find their own inner knowing while walking their unique path.
She protects her loved ones with her life, never speaks bad of them to others, respects them and keeps them in line so they will enjoy the respect of society and as a team they work together to get through this life.
## 'Does this mean I have to abandon my religious and cultural traditions?'
No. Wayism teaches practical spiritual evolution rather than requiring religious conversion. The key is understanding your true purpose while engaging consciously with life's opportunities for growth. Many people incorporate these understandings while maintaining their cultural identity.
## 'How do I explain this path to my religious family?'
Focus on what you're developing rather than what you're leaving behind. Share your experiences of positive growth, increased peace, and deeper understanding. Let your evolution speak for itself through how you live and love.
## 'If we're all evolving anyway, why be conscious of it?'
Think of it like swimming - you can float downstream without awareness, or you can swim purposefully toward your destination. Being conscious of your evolution allows you to participate actively rather than just being carried along by circumstances.
## 'What about evil and suffering in the world?'
Unlike religious views of cosmic warfare between good and evil, Wayism understands that what we call "evil" often reflects natural behavior of souls at earlier stages of development. Just as we don't call a toddler "evil" for being self-centered, we understand that souls act according to their level of development.
## 'Do I need a teacher or guru?'
While teachers can be helpful, your primary guide is your Divine Tara. The key is developing your ability to recognize and follow this inner guidance. Teachers should help you connect directly with divine wisdom, not become intermediaries.
## 'How do I know if I'm making progress?'
Look for:
- Increasing awareness of energy and its effects

- Greater compassion without losing discernment

- More authentic living and clearer intuition

- Better handling of life's challenges

- Growing sense of purpose and meaning

- Natural development of divine qualities
## 'What if I make mistakes?'
Mistakes aren't sins requiring forgiveness - they're learning opportunities. The law of karma ensures we get the experiences we need for growth. Sometimes these lessons come through what we'd call mistakes.
## "I am afraid to switch to Wayism. What if I am wrong and God punishes me, send me to hell?"
This is a deeply personal concern that deserves honest consideration. If you're coming from an Abrahamic religious background, you've been taught to view divine reality through the lens of reward and punishment, with eternal consequences for choosing incorrectly. The fear this creates is real and shouldn't be dismissed lightly. If you truly believe this there is no other way but for you to fully commit to your faith right now and live its prescriptions diligently and make sure you do not violate any rule.
But if you have doubt, yet still ask...well that's not easy to answer because you have to make some decisions first. In that case, read on.
Consider, though, what this fear reveals about the nature of the divine being you've been taught to worship. A deity who demands belief under threat of eternal torture, who requires blood sacrifice (even of his own son) for forgiveness, who commands the annihilation of entire peoples including baby children and their dogs and enslavement of the daughters - these characteristics align more with ancient human rulers than with divine reality.
Throughout history, this concept of deity has been used to justify some of humanity's darkest actions. Empire-building, cultural destruction, and religious warfare have all been sanctioned by these teachings. The biblical record itself documents divinely ordered genocides and cruel punishments that would horrify us if reported in today's news. In fact, Biblical and Quran accounts of the god's dealings are regarded as crimes against humanity. There is no place in modern society for inciting hatred against groups, and calls for genocide and large-scale warfare against people whose crime is they don't believe in your version of god. It is hard to understand the difference between the satan of those scriptures and the god.
Many Wayists who came from Abrahamic backgrounds reached a point where they could no longer reconcile these teachings with their deepening spiritual awareness. The transition wasn't about being "Jewish enough" or "not reading the Bible correctly" - it was about their higher consciousness awakening to a more profound understanding of divine reality.
However, if this fear of divine punishment still holds power over you, you may not be ready for this transition. That's perfectly okay. Some people find it helpful to explore Wayist teachings while maintaining their Christian practice - a gradual approach that allows for gentle evolution rather than abrupt change. There's no rush. Your spiritual journey is uniquely yours, and it must unfold at its own natural pace.
Remember: True divine beings are naturally beneficent - they cannot be otherwise. Fear of punishment reveals more about human control systems than about actual divine reality. When you're ready to explore beyond these limitations, you'll find that authentic spiritual growth has nothing to do with appeasing an angry deity and everything to do with developing your own divine nature.
## 'How does Wayism fit with modern science?'
Many Wayist understandings align with current scientific discoveries. From quantum physics' revelations about energy to neuroscience's findings about consciousness, and the organic minds of organs and biome, science often confirms what ancient wisdom has taught. We have been teaching this since the time when science taught the sun revolves around the earth, and accused us of lying about the existence of germs and viruses and the mind in fundamental particles. We don't need to choose between scientific and spiritual understanding, they serve two separate domains -- the domain of material energy and the domain of spiritual energy.
See our book, theWAY to Wholesomeness on Wayism.Net which speaks to the science and psychology why Wayists are happier and more successful than most people.
## 'What's the end goal?'
Unlike religious paths promising eternal paradise or threatening endless punishment, Wayism sees spiritual evolution as ongoing. Even after becoming a spiritual being, there's continued growth and service. The goal isn't escape from existence but transformation into higher forms of being and service.
## 'How do I start?'
Begin where you are:
- The only ritual that all Wayist perform is the Dayspring washing. Start there and over time you will notice how that simple ritual changes your life bit by bit. The chapter Living Waters speak to it.
- Recognize that consciously starting out on this path is in fact a big deal. It's not only a major life event, it's the start of a new direction, new focus, and new worldview. You will change.
- Don't sweat the small things. You read this book and your spirit jumped out and grabbed hold of it, wants to own it. Your soul remembered it from past lives and wants it. You are going by your heart and higher-self minds. Yes, brain-mind and Manipura soul-mind will have many questions and warnings and feel left out (pouting) but this is not their path, its your higher-self path. Truly, there is not much to learn, just a lot to unlearn.
- If you don't already have one, make yourself a little home shrine. Just a space on a clean surface where you collect some things that connect you to the larger energy ecology out there. Some ideas, of what many of us do for example, look for little feathers dropped by birds, a twig, a leaf, a pebble, a rock, a twig of an aromatic herb, a flower, a paper with a message important to you, a book.
These things become friends in that we all share energy and history, we all walked a path and we are all alive with universal energies and our bodies all die and our souls come back for new incarnations. In that, we are siblings and neighbors -- hug them close. Form an image in mind of what Lord Jesus looks like now that you see him differently (its just a brain-mind help) and same with what you resonate with how your divine guide looks. This will help brain-mind go with the new flow.
- Get hold of a Wayist book or two. I suggest "theWAY of the Heart Mind" as a starter because it highlights the teachings unique of Wayism. Everyone will eventually get themselves a copy of "Primary Teaching theWAY" which is available in soft and hard cover. It has 119 short chapters and contains all the ancient Wayist teaching, clear and beautiful. The book, theWAY of The Divine Taras is nice to have. And a lot of people like theWAY To Know Your Path and for young people try My Forever Friend and my personal favourite is the hardest write I ever did is, "Ridley the raindrop who didn't like to get wet".
- Join Wayist.Life the online community. Don't be worried when you are seemingly being ignored by others. We see Wayists do that out of respect for every person's journey. Reach out when you feel like it or have a question, you may just find the community open up more than expected. Say hi, I will say hi back at you.
- Work on becoming more joyful and inquisitive and adventurous. Seek life experiences and sensuous experiences. Go out there and have a real life -- this is what you came to Earth for -- to live a full and authentic life.
- Connect with your Divine Tara. It's easy. Just get into a higher-self frame of mind and be authentic, and pray, "Lord, please help me connect with you." Then listen in your quiet. Try and try again if not successful at first, it's merely a matter of finding the right high energy with which your deity can resonate with your energy. You have to get up there and hit that high note in your self -- and when you connect, you will know. It gets easier and clearer as you go. Always be listening, inspiration and connection sometimes comes unexpectedly when your energies are still and your mind is clear.
- Practice conscious living
- Develop energy awareness
- Learn from every experience
- Serve where you can. Helping in the online community is a great place to start if you don't yet have another calling.
Remember: The path isn't about confessing belief to some cause or deity - it's about developing your divine nature through conscious evolution. Every step, every challenge, every joy becomes opportunity for growth when you understand its true purpose.
## The Silent Revolution
### Understanding reactions to authentic living
When you begin living authentically, you may encounter unexpected hostility - not because you're preaching or opposing anyone, but simply because you're choosing to think and live independently. Understanding why this happens is crucial for maintaining your peace and continuing your path with wisdom.
## A Universal Pattern
Throughout history and across all cultures, those who live authentic spiritual truth have faced resistance despite their peaceful approach:
- Lord Jesus in ancient Palestine showed people direct divine connection
- Kabir in medieval India revealed truth beyond religious divisions
- Meister Eckhart in Europe spoke of direct spiritual experience
- Rumi in Persia celebrated universal divine love
- Indigenous teachers worldwide preserved wisdom of authentic living
- African mystics maintained spiritual truth through centuries of oppression
- Asian sages demonstrated the path of natural wisdom
What's remarkable is how these teachers, though separated by time, culture, and geography, all faced similar reactions to their simple truth-telling. Yet today, their words are celebrated across cultural boundaries - proving that authentic spiritual wisdom transcends artificial human divisions.
## Understanding Modern Resistance
The intensity of reaction to authentic living often seems disproportionate because it threatens multiple systems of control:
> I saw the mill, the mine, and shop, the little slaves of greed;
> I heard the strife of race with race, all sprung from one God-seed.
> And then I bowed my head in shame, and in contrition cried --
> 'Lo, after nineteen hundred years, Christ still is crucified.
*~ Christ Crucified by Ella Wheeler Wilcox*
### Social Programming
Modern society is carefully engineered to:
- Keep communities divided
- Stoke artificial conflicts
- Suppress independent thinking
- Control cultural expression
- Limit spiritual awareness
### The Mirror Effect
When you live authentically, you inadvertently expose:
- Artificial social divisions
- Manipulated narratives
- Controlled consciousness
- Systematic spiritual suppression
- Engineered conflicts
### Systemic Threat
Authentic living naturally threatens control systems by demonstrating:
- Religious intermediaries aren't necessary
- Social divisions are artificial
- Cultural control isn't inevitable
- Direct spiritual connection is everyone's birthright
- Independent thinking is possible
## Breaking Free
Understanding these dynamics helps us respond wisely:
1. Recognize the Bigger Picture
- Reactions often come from programmed responses
- Resistance indicates system-wide fear
- Your authenticity threatens established control
- You're part of a timeless tradition of truth-tellers
2. Maintain Your Peace
- No need to fight artificial divisions
- No need to prove anything to anyone
- No need to participate in engineered conflicts
- Focus on authentic growth and connection
3. Practice Universal Compassion
- See beyond programmed prejudices
- Recognize our shared divine nature
- Appreciate diverse expressions of truth
- Support others' awakening to authenticity
4. Stay Grounded in Truth
- Develop genuine cultural appreciation
- Foster authentic community
- Maintain spiritual independence
- Share wisdom naturally
## Moving Forward Together
The beauty of the Wayist path is how it naturally creates authentic unity - not through forced programs or artificial inclusion, but through genuine recognition of our shared divine nature and appreciation for its diverse expressions.
As you walk this path:
- Let understanding replace confusion about reactions
- Let compassion dissolve programmed divisions
- Let wisdom guide your relationships
- Let authenticity create natural community
Remember: You're part of a long, diverse tradition of truth-tellers whose simple authenticity has helped humanity evolve, even when that truth was initially met with resistance. From ancient sages to modern mystics, from East to West, from every culture and background, authentic spiritual wisdom has always pointed to the same truth - our essential unity beyond artificial divisions.
Your task isn't to fight opposition or prove anything to anyone. It's simply to live your truth authentically while maintaining peace and compassion. Through this, you naturally help break the cycles of manipulation and division that prevent authentic spiritual growth.
## Walking Catfoot
### The strange dance of truth in modern times
It's 2025, and we're still tiptoeing around speaking to others' beliefs that openly call for our annihilation. Think about that for a moment. With all our technological advancement, scientific understanding, and supposed social evolution, we still find ourselves carefully crafting our words when discussing their war manuals of how to destroy us, beliefs that explicitly mark *us* for violent elimination. Lord Jesus faced this same paradox two thousand years ago - and the pattern continues to play out in ways that would be comical if they weren't so serious.
Here's the modern absurdity: We live in a world where we must respectfully acknowledge beliefs that deny our right to exist, and if we speak to it we are labelled anti-xyz and prosecuted for discrimination. Spiritual teachers offering messages of universal love and human evolution must carefully phrase their insights to avoid offending those who believe such teachers deserve death and social crucifixion. They call this "religious tolerance" - but look at what we're actually tolerating.
This isn't just about traditional religion anymore. The pattern of spiritual inversion - turning wisdom upside down and defending the inversion as sacred truth - shows up everywhere. Political ideologies, social movements, even self-help programs can become inverted wisdom, demanding absolute loyalty while threatening destruction to outsiders. The names change, but the pattern remains: Groups claim exclusive access to truth while advocating harm to those who think differently.
Lord Jesus's experience in Judea wasn't just a historical event - it's a pattern that keeps repeating. Today's spiritual teachers face similar challenges when helping people trapped in belief systems that celebrate exclusivity and judgment. Whether it's religious fundamentalism, political extremism, or rigid ideological thinking, the core dynamic is the same: How do you help people see beyond beliefs that justify harm while working within those belief systems?
The religious authorities who confronted Lord Jesus believed they were defending sacred truth. Today's defenders of various "absolute truths" believe the same. They're not villains - they're humans caught in systems of inverted wisdom, genuinely believing that violence and exclusion in the name of 'inclusion and peace' serve divine purpose. This is why direct confrontation rarely works. You can't argue someone out of a belief system that defines itself by opposition to outside ideas, just as you cannot comply yourself out of tyranny.
Look at how this plays out in modern spiritual discussions. Teachers offering perspectives on universal human potential often have to carefully frame their message to avoid triggering defensive reactions. They must find ways to honor people's existing beliefs while gently expanding their understanding - just as Lord Jesus did. The need to "walk catfoot," as we've been calling it, isn't just political correctness. It's a practical necessity when helping people trapped in inverted wisdom that craze their soul.
But here's what makes this pattern especially fascinating today: We can see it more clearly than ever before. With global communication and access to diverse perspectives, the ironies become more apparent. We can observe how beliefs that claim to represent ultimate truth often display the exact opposite of wisdom's characteristics: fear instead of love, separation instead of unity, violence instead of peace.
This clarity presents both challenge and opportunity. The challenge is maintaining compassion while seeing the absurdity - understanding that people defending inverted wisdom are themselves victims of inverted thinking. The opportunity is learning to work skillfully with this pattern, just as Lord Jesus did, finding ways to help transform understanding from within rigid belief systems.
For those walking the path of spiritual evolution today, this understanding is crucial. You'll encounter this pattern of inverted wisdom in many forms. The key isn't to fight it directly or to walk on eggshells forever. Instead, like Lord Jesus, you can learn to work skillfully with it - honoring people's current understanding while helping them glimpse something deeper.
This isn't about compromise or watering down truth. It's about understanding how spiritual transformation actually works. Lord Jesus didn't tiptoe around harsh beliefs because he was afraid. He did it because he understood that true transformation happens through invitation and revelation, not through confrontation and rejection.
So yes, we still "walk catfoot" in 2024, carefully discussing perspectives that openly threaten to annihilate and enslave us. But we do it with growing awareness and skill, understanding that this strange dance is part of how wisdom works in a world of inverted thinking. The goal isn't to win arguments or prove others wrong - it's to help reveal the universal love and wisdom that exists beyond all our limited beliefs.
This is perhaps one of Lord Jesus's most relevant teachings for today: How to work skillfully with inverted wisdom while maintaining connection to truth. In a world increasingly divided by rigid beliefs and justified violence, this skill becomes ever more essential for those supporting human spiritual evolution.
And then there is the other truth. Lord Jesus trained a group of teachers wherever in the world he and Mari of Magadha travelled. She taught women, and he taught men. And those teachers worked in their communities. But the so-called apostles from Galilee, and the hundred or more healers he trained in the area, he sent them away to other areas -- to serve other people. There comes a time when you are not prepared to die on that hill like Lord Jesus did because it serves no good purpose, and then you turn your back and live your life in personal peace. That they see life as a problem to be solved rather than a spiritual school to be lived is their problem. We are not their school teachers and we don't set their curriculum -- they set it and Law of Karma helps them with developmentally appropriate learning opportunities. We don't try to convert anyone. But we are neighborly and will help Wayists find healing and teaching.
## Symbols used in theWAY
Three symbols in particular carry special significance for Wayists: theWAY official logo, the Butterfly Path symbol, and the Lotus.
### theWAY Logo
The logo of theWAY brings together several layers of meaning through its elegant design:
**The Color Spectrum**
Corresponding to the seven chakra energy centers, from the root to the crown --- representing the complete integration of all aspects of being --- physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.
**The Lotus Foundation**
Interwoven into this design are numerous elements of significance to theWAY symbolism:
***Divine Potential*** ~ The seed of divine potential lies within each of us. ****
***Lotus Blooming*** ~ Like the lotus that rises from murky depths to bloom, it represents the soul's journey from ignorance to enlightenment. The petals arranged in concentric circles suggest the unfolding of consciousness.****
***Community Connection*** ~ Speaking to the Wayist understanding of universal interconnectedness and the importance of community on the spiritual journey.****
***Butterfly Path*** ~ The butterfly wings, connecting the core teaching of the Butterfly Path --- the soul's transformation into an immortal spiritual being.****
***Energy Flow*** ~ Flowing infinity lines embody the principle of energy movement and transformation.****
***Interconnectedness*** ~ Everything is interconnected on all levels, everything is energy. ****
***YinYang*** ~ The eternal balance of Yin and Yang energies, fundamental forces that permeate all existence.
### **The Butterfly Path Symbol**
This ancient symbol, dating back approximately 2,000 years, captures the essence of the spiritual journey in visual form:
***Upward Spiral*** ~ The ascending spiral pattern represents the soul's evolutionary journey through multiple incarnations, each cycle bringing greater wisdom and awareness.****
***Gathering Energy*** ~ The gathering of energy spirals at the base of the design suggest that we harness our energies and embark on our journey.****
***Energy Elements*** ~ The flow of energy that is continuous reminds us of the journey with its twist and turns, of our ultimate destiny --- to emerge from our chrysalis state into fully realized spiritual beings.****
***Central Axis*** ~ The vertical energy flow suggests the alignment of lower and higher selves, the integration of soul and spirit.****
****
***Points of Transformation*** ~ Key points along the spiral mark critical stages of spiritual awakening and transformation.****
***Lotus*** ~ The lotus always reaching for the light, as we are towards our enlightenment. The lotus rooted in the mud, growing through murky waters, reaching for the light, and bursting into bloom --- symbolic of our diversity, strengths, focused authenticity and potential.
### The Lotus
The lotus flower plant profound significance in Wayist teaching, representing the soul's journey from ignorance to enlightenment. Like the lotus seed descending into murky depths before sprouting, rising through muddy waters to bloom in pristine beauty above the surface, so does the soul plunge into worldly experience before ascending to spiritual awakening. The lotus teaches us to find nourishment even in difficult circumstances, to rise steadily toward the light while remaining pure and unsullied by surroundings, and to offer shelter and inspiration to others along the way. Its daily cycle of closing and opening reminds us of the value of both solitude and renewal, while its ability to thrive in both murky and biologically active water and in clear still waters teaches us to maintain equanimity in all circumstances
In Wayist tradition, symbols serve not as objects of veneration but as bridges to deeper understanding. They are tools that help focus the mind and inspire contemplation of profound truths. As visual teaching, they speak directly to both conscious and unconscious aspects of our being, gently guiding us toward deeper understanding of theWAY.
In meditation and daily life, these symbols can serve as anchors for awareness, bringing us back to our highest purpose and the timeless wisdom they encode. They remind us that we are all butterflies in becoming, supported by an ancient tradition of transformation and awakening.
## About the Author

<Photo of Jean, Adele, and friends (India, 2019)> Jean Prieur du Plessis's search for the authentic teachings of Lord Jesus began in his youth, reading the Bible alongside Eastern philosophical texts while dutifully attending mandatory church services in 1970's South Africa. Even as a young person, he sensed there was more to Lord Jesus's message than what was being taught in Christian churches -- his inner experience of the Lord Jesus was irreconcilable with the god of the Bible and the history of Christian regimes, a deeper truth waiting to be uncovered.
This intuition led him on a decades-long journey through Christian denominations, theological studies, and world religions. After completing seminary training and advanced degrees in comparative religion in the 1990s, his path ultimately led to Kashmir, India. There, an encounter with a teacher from the Ancient Church of the East introduced him to Wayism - an ancient spiritual tradition of advanced energy healing and wisdom teaching that had been carefully preserved within esoteric circles for centuries. In this tradition, Jean finally discovered the Lord Jesus he had been seeking all his life.
Together with his partner Adéle, Jean was ordained as a minister and served spiritual communities in South Africa. With their teacher's blessing, they embarked on a 15-year project to make Wayist teachings accessible in English, collaborating with elders across India, China and the Middle East.
While "Jesus the Wayist" bears Jean's name as author, he considers it a collaborative work emerging from the collective wisdom of the Wayist tradition. Like most Wayist writings, it represents not individual achievement but shared understanding developed through deep relationships with teachers, fellow practitioners, and the divine wisdom they all serve.
This book is part of an extensive body of English-language works on Wayism, much of which were produced by the collective known as Salvar Dàosenglu. It aims to share the profound yet practical spiritual understanding that Jean discovered on his own search for truth - a concern shared by millions of former Christians -- leading to an understanding that transforms not just beliefs about Lord Jesus, but our entire approach to spiritual development and life itself.
