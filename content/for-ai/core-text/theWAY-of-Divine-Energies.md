# ~ Foreword
The path to the Real and ultimate Wisdom is a journey that unfolds through the minds of the spirit. Books, like the one you hold in your hands, serve as maps, guiding you along the paths that others have traversed to reach their destination. However, when the Destination finally comes into view, you realize that it was neither the map nor the path that brought you there, but the journey itself.
This book, along with others I have written, is a carefully crafted map, born not only from my own journey but also from four decades of studying under teachers of theWAY in several cultures, reading the ancient seers and sages, and collaborating with others from around the world to compile English-language scriptures for Wayists.
With all my heart and much love, I have written this detailed map for you, not for you to find that which words cannot speak of, but to help you navigate out of the maze. We all know that one day, just as we have experienced, you too will catch a glimpse of that distant shore. In that moment, the words of this book, all the words of the holy scriptures and the books of other people's directions, will fade away. For no teaching can truly capture the profound wisdom and peace, the understanding, and insight which finds its home within you, supplanting all prior knowledge.
May you, too, soon find yourself in that place where you know nothing, yet possess the wisdom to comprehend the All, and set this insufficient book aside for someone else to discover on their own journey. For it is in the act of seeking that one truly finds, and in the act of letting go that one truly grasps the essence of the Real.

## ~ Ishani's Journey of Discovery
> *Ishani is a prime example of newcomers who are drawn to Wayist mysticism. In this fictional story, her journey towards spiritual awareness is depicted, encompassing the various themes explored in the book.*
In the depths of her despair, Ishani found herself adrift in a sea of hopelessness, her once vibrant soul dimmed by the weight of the world's dystopian shadows. At 28, she had witnessed the crumbling of her faith in humanity, the erosion of purpose and meaning, and the withering of her dreams for a brighter future.
"What is the point of it all?" she whispered to the silence, her voice trembling with the echoes of her shattered heart."Is there nothing more to life than this endless cycle of deceit, malignant social engineering, suffering and despair?"
Grasping at the fraying threads of hope, Ishani knew that the hollow promises of religion could not mend the wounds of her soul. Her spirit yearned for something deeper, something real, seeking a truth that resonated with the very essence of her being.
And then, like a beacon in the darkness, as if sent by the gods, she stumbled upon the ancient wisdom of Wayism. As she delved into the pages of the text, it became sacred to her because a flicker of recognition ignited within her, a kindling of the divine spark that had lain dormant for so long.
"Soul-people and Spirit-people," she mused, the words dancing upon her tongue like a secret language of the heart."The Butterfly Path, a journey of transformation and awakening," she sounded the concept out in her heart, her soul jumping in recognition of age old wisdom, for long forgotten.
As the realization dawned upon her, Ishani felt an unshakable certainty deep within her being. She knew she was a Spirit-person, destined to soar beyond the soul realm and embrace the limitless possibilities of the divine within. As she listened to the teaching, a wave of familiarity washed over her old soul, and her spirit stirred with memories of blessed times from the past.
As she explored the teachings of Wayism, Ishani felt the pieces of her fractured world begin to fall into place.
The concept of a spirit guardian, a celestial companion who had watched over her since the dawn of her existence, filled her with a sense of comfort and belonging.
"Sukhavati, the Land of Pure Bliss; Mother God in Heaven and Father God in Heaven; the heavenly realm of my destiny," she whispered, her eyes brimming with tears of wonder and recognition."The Father and Mother of Heaven, the deities who know me, who have loved me since the beginning of my time," her whispering voice breaking with emotion, "Oh my Lord!, I belong..."
The understanding of Paradise as a temporary respite between incarnations brought a newfound clarity to Ishani's understanding of life's greater purpose. The cycles of birth, death, and rebirth were no longer a source of fear, but a sacred dance of growth and evolution of the spirit.
Ishani felt a call from the depths of her soul, a yearning to connect with her Divine Tara, our connection to the divine realm, and experience the divine presence of deities, angels, and buddhas. Falling to her knees, she poured out the depths of her shattered soul, laying bare the wounds of her past and the longings of her spirit.
"Divine Tara, my beloved guide, "she whispered, her voice raw with emotion."I am lost, broken. I need your love and wisdom. Please, take my hand and lead me out of this darkness, into the light of your eternal grace."
In her moment of surrender, Ishani felt a rising of divine energy in her chest, a swell of unconditional love that enveloped her entire being. The mystical experiences described in the text of Wayism became sacred, began to unfold before her, guiding her longing to lose her soul-self in this profound journey of spiritual awakening.
As she embarked on the practice of Divine Tarayoga, Ishani found herself attuning to the loving presence and guidance of her Divine Tara. With each breath, each whispered mantra, she felt the barriers between her soul and the divine begin to dissolve, revealing a spirit world of limitless beauty and grace.
"Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha," she chanted in her mind."I surrender to your love, your wisdom, your infinite compassion.", her voice whispered a gentle caress upon the stillness of her heart.
In the depths of her passion, Ishani began to experience the profound states of Mystiception, a heightened spiritual awareness that transcended the boundaries of her ordinary mind. Colors became more vivid, sounds more melodic, and the very air seemed to vibrate with the essence of the divine. As her love for the divine grew stronger, it felt as though her mind was on the verge of exploding.
The divine presence of her Tara was tangible."Is this what it means to touch the face of God?" she wondered, tears of awe and reverence streaming down her face."To be embraced by a love so vast, so all-encompassing? It is almost to much to bear in my heart."
As her practice deepened, following her Tara, Ishani found herself approaching the Theopathic Nexus, a pivotal point in her mystical journey where her emotional, psychological, and spiritual energies converged with the divine. It was a brief moment of profound transformation, a shattering of the illusions that had once held her captive.
"I am not alone, "she whispered, her voice trembling with the weight of her realization. Tears of awe streaming down her cheeks as if rivulets of divine nectar."I have never been alone. The divine has always been with me, guiding me, loving me, even in my darkest hours." And then she sobbed herself into the most blissful sleep she had in years, a smile on her now lovely, relaxed face.
With each passing day, Ishani felt herself growing more attuned to the higher frequencies of divine energy, her spirit becoming a clear and radiant channel for the flow of love and wisdom. The more Wayist teachings she read, the more enlightened she felt. The once complex and clinical philosophical statements now appeared simple and straightforward, providing answers to all her questions about the universe and the world. The experiences of Theopathic Resonance and Theopathy became her constant companions, filling her with a sense of ecstatic communion and oneness with all of creation. In everything around her, from the plants to the people to the garden slugs, she sensed the powerful presence of the Divine Universal Energy. Living beings surrounded her, filling the air with joy and awe, the presence of humans not diminishing the vibrant atmosphere.
"I am the drop, and the Universal Energy is the ocean,"she mused, her heart expanding to embrace the infinite.
"In this moment, there is no separation, no division, only the eternal dance of energy beings, affinity and unity."
As Ishani continued her practice of Karman Active Meditation, she felt the sacred postures and gestures awakening the subtle energies within her body, purifying her chakra minds and aligning her entire being with the divine flow of the universe. Each movement became a prayer, each breath an offering of devotion and surrender.
"I am the mountain, rooted in the earth," she whispered, her body strong and still."I am the tree, reaching for the heavens. I am the survivor of many lifetimes, strong, wise, and compassionate. I am becoming a spirit divine, expressing myself through every cell of my being."
In the midst of her mystical experiences, through Ajna mind, Ishani encountered the Psychomesion, the intermediate realm between the physical and spiritual worlds. Here, she offered wholesome energy, encouragement and blessings to the souls who lingered, afraid of letting go of their dying human bodies, guiding them with compassion and understanding to walk with their Tara towards the light of Paradise.
"Go in peace," she murmured, her heart overflowing with love." You are not forgotten, you are not alone. The divine welcomes you home, now, and always."
As Ishani integrated the profound insights and wisdom of her mystical experiences into her daily life, she found herself walking through the world with a new sense of purpose and clarity. She had become a vessel for divine love, a beacon of hope and compassion in a world that so desperately needed healing.
"I am a Wayist," she declared, her voice ringing with the strength of her conviction."I am a child of the divine Father and Mother in Heaven, forever guided by the love and wisdom of my celestial companion. In this path, I have found my true home, my reason for being, and the meaning of life itself."
And so Ishani continued her journey, walking hand in hand with her Divine Tara, her heart alight with the radiance of unconditional love. She had become a living embodiment of the Wayist teachings, a testament to the transformative power of mystical union and divine grace.
"I am home," she whispered once more, her spirit soaring on the wings of eternal love."I walk with a god, and I am forever blessed."

Chapter 1
## Understanding Mystic Spirituality
### To help brain-mind understand spirit-mind experiences
This 3-part section deals with what may seem to be technical learning at first, but it will soon show itself to be the keys to simplicity in understanding the fundamental questions of life that every human must at some or other time on their path of growth, stop to ask.
In this 650-year-old poem by Lalleshwari of Kashmir, our enigmatic mystic teacher and lady of theWAY speaks to the value of books and teachings --- book learning is information that will soon fade to nothingness at death of the brain-mind, but connecting with the Divine brings change, permanent wisdom in the spirit, insight to the soul-self, and authenticity of being.
*To learn the scriptures is easy,*
*to live them, hard.*
**
*The search for the Real*
*is no simple matter.*
*Deep in my looking,*
*the last words vanished.*
**
*Joyous and silent,*
*the waking that met me there.*
*~ Lalleshwari*

### The Tapestry of Existence
### Understanding the Three Energy Domains
Everything, and ALL, are Energy. Imagine, if you will, the entirety of existence as a vast, multidimensional tapestry of unimaginable scope and complexity. This cosmic tapestry encompasses all that is, was, and will be, across all realms and dimensions of being.
It is a living, breathing work of art, constantly evolving and transforming, woven from three distinct yet intertwined types of threads:
**1. The Material Energy Domain**
Represented by thick, visible threads that form the base pattern of the tapestry. These threads correspond to the physical world we readily perceive with our bodily senses --- the realm of matter, energy, and the laws of physics as we understand them.
**2. The Soul Energy Domain**
Symbolized by finer, shimmering threads interwoven with the base pattern. These threads are subtler but still discernible upon closer inspection. They represent the realm of emotions, thoughts, and the individual consciousness of living beings.
**3. The Spiritual Energy Domain**
Depicted as nearly invisible, luminescent threads that run throughout the tapestry. These threads are imperceptible to most observers but give the tapestry its true depth and radiance. They embody the highest vibrations of divine wisdom, unconditional love, and universal consciousness.
All three types of threads exist simultaneously in every part of the tapestry, just as the energy domains co-exist in our universe. This explains how heaven can be "within," as Lord Jesus taught, for the threads of the Spiritual Energy Domain are present everywhere, including within us, waiting to be perceived and embraced.
### The Weaving Process
The cosmic tapestry is not static; it is in a constant state of creation and transformation. Every thought, action, and energy exchange across all domains contributes to its weaving. The movements of galaxies, the cycles of life and death, the evolution of consciousness --- all are reflected in the ever-changing patterns of the tapestry.
In this grand design, each being is both a thread and a weaver. Our journey through existence, particularly on the Butterfly Path, is represented by our individual threads. We begin as thick, visible threads firmly anchored in the Material Energy Domain. As we progress spiritually, our threads gradually transform, becoming finer and more luminescent, weaving more intricately with the Soul and Spiritual domains.
### Perception and Awakening
Humans, in this analogy, are like observers with varying levels of perception:
~ Most people only see the base pattern, focusing solely on the Material Energy Domain. They limit their understanding of reality to what the physical senses can perceive and scientific instruments can measure.
~ Those who have begun to develop their soul-minds can perceive the shimmering threads of the Soul Energy Domain. They become aware of the subtle energies, emotions, and interconnectedness of all living beings.
~ Those with awakened spirit-minds can discern the luminescent threads of the Spiritual Energy Domain. They gain insight into the highest truths of existence and experience direct communion with the divine.
The Anahata mind, or heart chakra, acts as a special lens, allowing us to gradually refine our perception and see beyond the surface pattern into the deeper layers of the tapestry. It is through the Anahata that we develop the capacity for divine love, which attunes us to the higher frequencies of the Spiritual Energy Domain.
### Navigating the Tapestry
For the Wayist practitioner, the journey of spiritual growth is one of learning to navigate and interact with all layers of the cosmic tapestry. This journey involves several key aspects:
**1. Developing Awareness**
Through practices such as meditation and mindfulness, we learn to expand our perception beyond the Material domain. We begin to sense the shimmering threads of the Soul domain and, eventually, the luminescent threads of the Spiritual domain.
**2. Attuning to Higher Frequencies**
As we cultivate qualities such as compassion, wisdom, and unconditional love, we attune ourselves to the higher frequencies of the Spiritual domain. This is akin to learning to perceive and work with the finest, most luminescent threads in the tapestry.
**3. Recognizing Patterns**
With increased awareness, we start to recognize the intricate patterns formed by the interplay of the three types of threads. This corresponds to gaining insight into the laws of karma, the interconnectedness of all beings, and the divine order underlying apparent chaos.
**4. Conscious Weaving**
As we progress, we learn to consciously participate in the weaving process. Through our thoughts, actions, and spiritual practices, we can influence the patterns of the tapestry, contributing to the harmony and beauty of existence.
**5. Collaboration with Divine Guides**
Our Divine Taras, represented as master weavers in this analogy, guide us in navigating and interacting with the tapestry. They help us perceive the finer threads and teach us how to weave more skillfully, aligning our individual patterns with the greater divine design.
### Challenges and Growth
The journey through the tapestry is not without its challenges. Knots and tangles in our individual threads represent karmic lessons and obstacles we must overcome. These challenges often occur at the intersections of the different energy domains, as we learn to integrate higher awareness into our everyday lives.
Working through these knots --- whether through life experiences, spiritual practices, or the guidance of our Divine Taras --- is essential for our growth. Each resolved tangle allows our thread to become finer and more luminescent, weaving more harmoniously with the higher domains.
### Mystiception and Divine Communion
The practice of mystiception, as taught in Wayism, can be understood as a profound way of perceiving and interacting with the finest threads of the Spiritual Energy Domain.
During states of mystiception, practitioners may experience:
~ Vivid awareness of the luminescent spiritual threads.
~ Direct perception of the underlying patterns and divine order of the tapestry.
~ Moments of unity with the entire tapestry, transcending individual existence.
~ Communion with divine beings, experiencing their mastery in weaving the highest patterns.
These experiences provide glimpses of the ultimate reality and inspire us to continue our journey of spiritual growth.
### Conclusion
The analogy of the cosmic tapestry offers a powerful framework for understanding the co-existence of the three energy domains and our journey of spiritual evolution. As we progress on the Butterfly Path, we learn to perceive, navigate, and consciously participate in the weaving of this grand design.
By cultivating awareness, attuning to higher frequencies, and working in harmony with our Divine Taras, we gradually transform our individual threads. From the thick, visible threads of the Material domain, we evolve towards the fine, luminescent threads of the Spiritual domain. In doing so, we fulfill our highest potential as spiritual beings and contribute to the beauty and harmony of the entire tapestry of existence.
This journey of awakening and conscious participation in the cosmic tapestry is the essence of Wayist spirituality. It is a path of endless discovery, growth, and service, leading us to ever-greater alignment with the divine purpose of existence.
## 1.1 Wayist Ontology and Teachings
***Define Ontology ****: "Ontology is the branch of metaphysics that deals with the nature of being, the purpose of life, the meaning of life, The Absolute, and the Source"*
### The Absolute and Source
At the foundation of existence is THAT, which is the causal factor behind all of creation. This, the Absolute, is impossible for the human mind to fully comprehend, so we refer to it simply as the THAT, or the Absolute, and then remain silent on trying to qualify or describe it any further. Any words we use, would be inherently limiting the illimitable, and inaccurate if not patently false.
Humans cannot know much. Our brains are simply not capable enough. But, we do understand from the ancients of days that one of the fundamental creations of the Absolute, is the Source of all energies in the universes. We call that energy, the Universal Energy.
*A thousand times my Guru I asked:*
*How shall the Nameless be defined?*
**
*I asked and asked but all in vain.*
**
*The Nameless Unknown, it seems to me,*
*Is the Source, of the something that we see.*
*~ Lalleshwari*
### YinYang ~ The Basis of All Energies
From the Source flows a bipolar energy called the YinYang. The Yin and Yang are opposites, and every form of energy that exists is a particular blend of these two primal forces. There can never be purely Yin or purely Yang energy --- there is always some of the opposite within each.
Because the YinYang has an inner movement between its "polarities" of frequencies (if one may loan those terms from physics) as if it may be a persistent sound that underlies all of creation. It has been described by various names in the ancient spiritualities. One such name is "The Word", which is the Sabda in Sanskrit, also symbolized as the "OM", the energies of creation.
### The Three Energy Domains
We know of one particular massive energy structure called theWAY that emerged from the Source.
theWAY, as a divine method, path, plan, and structured flow, has been described by various names in the ancient spiritualities. One such name is "The Word", the logos, which is derived from how humans perceive the Energies (YinYang) were ordered in a divine mind, to produce an idea, a thought, then structured into coherent parts, then expressed --- and what is expressed is a structured, organized, energy structure, a blueprint, a Way, a plan, a system within which our known universe exists. Within theWAY, energies are structured to function as according to three energy domains:
Spiritual Energy Domain Soul Energy Domain
Material Energy Domain
#### **The different energy domains can intersect and co-exist in some cases, but not in others:**
-   Energies from the Soul and Spiritual Domains can enter the Material Energy Domain.
-   However, soul-energy beings cannot enter the Spiritual Domain.
#### **Within each domain, there are respective energy structures and beings:**
-   The Spiritual Domain contains spiritual-energy structures and spiritual-energy beings (often referred to as deities or gods).
-   The Soul Domain contains soul-energy structures and soul-energy beings.
-   The Material Domain contains very dense material energy structures like galaxies, stars, planets, and the biological bodies of living entities.
Of these three domains, the Material Energy Domain is the only one currently studied by human science and physics, which has mapped the electromagnetic energies but not yet comprehended other forces like gravity.
The Soul Energy Domain and Spiritual Energy Domain are metaphysical realms that remain unstudied by science. Here, the prefix *meta* indicates 'beyond' and 'above' physics.
### The Nature of Energy Structures
Everything in existence is a form of energy. In the Domain of Material Energy the most fundamental energy structures are the building blocks of the subatomic particles like muons and electrons. But all objects, beings, and structures --- from atoms to biological cells to galaxies --- are just increasingly complex energy structures that were built by the fundamental building blocks. In that manner, all emerge from the primordial YinYang energies.
#### **Each energy structure, no matter how simple or complex, has:**
-   A sense of individual identity or "ego" that allows it to maintain its particular structure.
-   A sense of purpose, continually functioning in its characteristic way.
-   A sense and ability to cooperatively join with other energy structures to form new, higher-level structures when it aids their mutually understood objectives.
This principle applies to energy structures at all levels, from subatomic particles to biological organisms to celestial bodies.
We know that we don't know enough to speak to this yet we use the terms, "everything has mind" and most things are sentient (can sense energies of others and react to it). As with humans in groups, when energy structures group together to form larger collectives a group mind forms and the individual's mind is a contributor to the larger group mind.
Material energy entities are mortal. Decay, disassembly and being recycled is inevitable.
### The Spiritual Energy Beings
Within the Spiritual Energy Domain exist several species of spiritual-energy beings. They live in spiritual spaces, dwellings or realms sometimes referred to as "heavens" in mythological traditions. These highly advanced and refined energy beings primarily work as "energy custodians" so-to-speak, maintaining the proper energies of theWAY.
Spiritual beings are immortal.
### The Soul Energy Beings
The Soul Energy Domain contains a vast collection of soul species and communities of soul-energy beings. Advanced species may group together and occupy spaces in that domain, all with their own leaders and councils. Their primary role is to provide the animating life forces that allow for the existence of biological organisms across the multiverse.
All living beings --- plants, fungi, insects, animals --- contain a soul. Soul is what makes an otherwise inanimate object alive. Some souls are more complex than others, with the human soul being one of the more evolutionarily advanced.
As it is for humans too, when the biological vessel of a living being can no longer sustain its soul energy, the soul departs and returns to the Soul Energy Domain until it can once again incarnate into a new biological form. Therefore, the food which all living beings eat never contains the soul because it leaves the body (plant or animal). Only the organic material is consumed as food.
Soul beings have characteristics that help them to navigate their existence of perpetual reincarnations into various bodies throughout the galaxy and beyond. They are power-seeking beings, expert at survival, competition, hoarding resources, the prosperity of their species and tribe.
Souls are finite, mortal beings. More advanced souls of different species, such as they who come here to have human experiences, have natural lifespans ranging from one to about twenty thousand Earth years. Human souls who awaken spiritually receive "dosages of immortality" as they evolve spiritually and that prolongs the lifespan of the soul. In time, the soul may metamorphose into an immortal spirit.
### The Human Soul
The essence of the human soul is its three minds (Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura) which create the energy aura of the human soul-body. The soul incarnates into a developing human embryo to temporarily reside within a biological body on the Material Plane.
When that biological body can no longer sustain the soul's energies, the soul disconnects and is drawn back to the Soul Energy Domain, specifically a region referred to as Paradise, where it awaits another opportunity to incarnate into a new body. The Law of Karma will allocate the most beneficial body, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic group to serve the soul's unique curriculum on Butterfly Path school.
Their nature is power-seeking beings, expert at survival, competition, hoarding resources, the prosperity of their species and tribe. They value cunning, physical prowess, and exerting power and influence over others, and their beauty standards prize the better genetic breeding stock. When they dominate in democratic elections, they elect leaders who hold the same values and are prone to working toward national pride, empire, and domination of resources. They create religions with gods who are like them, just more powerful, and they are prone to dehumanize people who do not believe in their ideologies.
### The Human Spirit
The essence of the human spirit is its three minds (Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara). It is attached to the human soul by means of another mind, a hybrid soul-spirit mind called the Anahata (heart chakra). Initially, the seed of spiritual potential is planted in the Anahata and when the human develops loving-kindness greater than what is normal for soul beings, the spirit potential awakens and the spirit-minds are deployed, still attached to the human soul.
Those referred to as Spirit-people are humans who have awakened their spirits and have made their spirit-minds the main controllers of their soul-mind-spirit bodies. As individuals, they are characterized by their spiritual wisdom in loving-kindness, simplicity, and humility.
### Sukhavati Heaven and the Butterfly Path
One notable spiritual realm is Sukhavati, meaning "Land of Pure Bliss." The spiritual beings of Sukhavati specialize in providing energetic healing and helping support to soul beings across the galaxies.
The king and queen of Sukhavati, sometimes called God the Father and God the Mother of Heaven, lead this effort. All Sukhavati beings originated as "sparks" of energy from Father (yang -energies) that were then nurtured by Mother (yin-energies) and her divine assistants.
To increase their numbers of skilled helpers, the Sukhavati deities established a "school of divinity" on planet Earth called the Butterfly Path. Here, human souls can go through successive transformations, similar to a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, to have their soul essences gradually transmuted into that of spiritual-energy beings who can then join the realm of immortals in Sukhavati.
This path allows for the human soul to shift from its preoccupations with physical needs and material strivings (the caterpillar), and become a being focused only on the refined "nectar" of spiritual wisdom and growth (the butterfly), entering into a new plane of sublime existence.
#### *For ever we came*
*For ever we come, for ever we go; *
*For ever, day and night, we are on the move. *
*Whence we come, thither we go, *
*For ever in the round of birth and death, *
*From nothingness to nothingness. *
*But sure, a mystery here abides, *
*A Something is there for us to know. *
*(It cannot all be meaningless?)*
*~ Lalleshwari*
### In Sum
In the Wayist worldview, the universe is composed of multiple energy domains, each with its own unique properties and characteristics. In the Spirit Energy Domain is a spirit-energy stellar system known as Sukhavati, which is governed by two divine entities: God our Father in Heaven and God our Mother in Heaven.
The essence of Wayism lies in the understanding that our ultimate purpose is to evolve from soul to spirit nature, or in other words, to evolve our soul into an immortal spiritual being, awakening to our spiritual potential and aligning our thoughts, words, and actions with the highest energy: divine wisdom, humility and simplicity and helpful-lovingkindness. This process of spiritual evolution is known as the "Butterfly Path," a metaphor for the profound transformation that occurs as we shed the limitations of our lower-selves and emerge into the beauty and freedom of our divine spiritual essence.
The Wayist perspective on the divine realm of Sukhavati and its celestial inhabitants offers an inclusive view that bridges various spiritual traditions. According to Wayist beliefs, Sukhavati is the residence of a profoundly enlightened spiritual deity who manifested as a human to spread the teachings of theWAY (which is known as the Dao in Chinese), across the globe. This divine avatar appeared over the course of history known by the different cultures and traditions which were served at that time. Some of the prominent names are Lord Jesus and Lord Krishna, to mention only two.
The concept of a divine being descending to Earth to re-establish the teaching of theWAY, because over time it gets muddled, and therefore help spirit-people on the higher-self journey towards spiritual enlightenment, is a common theme in spiritualities. These divine teachers disseminate the universal principles of theWAY, which encompass transformation of the soul and rebirth as spirit, teaching of God our Father in heaven, loving-kindness, simplicity, and humbleness, and the recognition of the inherent unity of all beings because we all share in the same Universal Energy within the same Way. By embodying these principles and sharing them with the world, this spiritual deity aimed to help individuals awaken their spiritual potential and embark on the path of spiritual transformation.
The Wayist perspective on Sukhavati finds resonance with other spiritual traditions. Buddhists, for example, confirm that Sukhavati is the dwelling place of Buddha Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism who attained enlightenment and taught the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Similarly, Wayist Hindus believe that Sukhavati is the abode of Lord Krishna, an avatar of the god Vishnu, and founder of Yoga, who is revered for his divine wisdom and loving devotion.
The recognition of Sukhavati as the residence of various deities, buddhas, gods, and angels from different spiritual traditions highlights the inclusive and unifying nature of the Wayist perspective. It suggests that, despite the diversity of religious and cultural expressions, there is an underlying unity and a shared destination for those who have attained spiritual enlightenment.
However, it is important to note that in the Wayist worldview, God our Father and God our Mother in Heaven, who oversee and nurture the spiritual realm of Sukhavati, are not to be confused with the Absolute, the THAT, principle itself.
The THAT, principle, as mentioned earlier, is the ineffable and incomprehensible source of all existence, beyond the scope of human understanding or description.
God our Father and God our Mother in Heaven, on the other hand, are seen as the guardians and nurturers of Sukhavati, a realm of spiritual energy where enlightened beings reside. They are responsible for maintaining the harmony, love, and wisdom that characterize this divine realm and for guiding and supporting the spiritual growth of those who aspire to reach it.
The Wayist understanding of Sukhavati and its celestial inhabitants offers a bridge between various spiritual traditions, highlighting the common threads of wisdom, compassion, and the pursuit of enlightenment.
It encourages individuals to look beyond the surface differences of religious doctrines and to recognize the shared goal of spiritual transformation and unity with the divine.
By acknowledging the presence of a profoundly enlightened spiritual deity who manifested as a human teacher, as well as the existence of other revered figures from different traditions in Sukhavati, Wayism promotes a spirit of inclusivity and respect for the diverse ways in which the divine truth has been expressed throughout history.
This perspective invites individuals to embrace the universal principles of theWAY, as taught by the divine teachers, and to strive towards spiritual growth and the realization of their immortal spirit-self.
It is a call to look beyond the limitations of individual beliefs and to recognize the inherent unity and sacredness of all living entities, and all humans are here for one purpose: to evolve their souls into immortal spiritual beings.
## 1.2 The Butterfly Path: A Journey of Spiritual Evolution
The Butterfly Path is a powerful metaphor for the journey of spiritual evolution that lies at the heart of Wayist teachings. Just as a caterpillar undergoes a profound transformation to emerge as a beautiful butterfly, a being of an entirely different nature, so too do we shed the limitations of our soul and its soul-minds (the lower three chakras) to awaken to our true nature as eternal spiritual beings.
This journey is one of progressive unfoldment, as we navigate the challenges and opportunities of human life to cultivate the wisdom, and spiritual powers derived from simplicity, humbleness, and chrestotes which is helpful loving-kindness. Along the way, we are guided by the loving presence of our Divine Tara, a celestial being who serves as our spiritual mentor and companion.
The Butterfly Path encompasses three primary stages of growth: the caterpillar, the chrysalis, and the butterfly. In the caterpillar stage, we are primarily identified with our physical bodies and soul-minds, focused on survival, hoarding resources, competition, domination, physical prowess and the pursuit of egoistic worldly pleasures. As we begin to awaken to the spirit, we become a hybrid being of soul and spirit. We become aware in our newly unfolding spirit-minds (Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara) of deeper dimensions of our being, we enter the chrysalis stage, a period of introspection, self-discovery, and radical transformation.
During the chrysalis stage, we engage in spiritual practices such as prayer, meditation, and mystiception to purify our minds, hearts, and souls. We confront our soul shadows, heal our wounds, and cultivate the spiritual skills and wisdoms of humility, helpful lovingkindness. This process can be challenging, as we let go of old patterns and identities, but it is also immensely rewarding, as we begin to taste the nectar of our divine essence.
Finally, we emerge from the chrysalis as a reborn being, a newborn butterfly, awake to our true nature and aligned with the highest wisdom and love. In this stage, we recognize our interconnectedness with all life and dedicate ourselves to the Path, in service of others, utilizing our unique gifts and talents to uplift and inspire.
The Butterfly Path is not a linear journey, but rather a spiral of ever-deepening growth and realization. As we continue to engage in spiritual practice and service, we experience new levels of insight, healing, and transformation, our souls ultimately merging with the divine spirit awakened within, and continue in immortality living and working in the Heaven of our species of spiritual beings. In Sanskrit, the ancient seers referred to our Heaven as Sukhavati, meaning "Pure Land of Bliss". It is here where God our Father and God our Mother in Heaven reside. We will be reborn there as immortal spiritual beings, living alongside all who graduated from Butterfly Path, known in various cultures as buddhas, deities, gods, taras, or angels.
When our souls first joined Butterfly Path, we were received in a soul heaven called Paradise. It is a transitory space from where souls come and go during the many reincarnations they will need to advance in the grades of Butterfly Path school of divinity for souls. When we first arrived at this school, an additional soul-mind was added to the three minds our souls already had (Muladhara, Svadhistana, and Manipura). The additional soul-mind is Anahata (so-called "heart chakra"). It is a hybrid soul-spirit mind. In Anahata is placed a "seed" of divine potential which was donated from the very essence of God our Father in Heaven.
When we advance in cultivating the different kinds of love, and exceed the loves that are normal for souls, that seed of divine potential unfolds --- our first spiritual awakening. When it unfolds, three spiritual minds are attached to our soul (Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara). Anahata becomes the bridge between soul-self and spirit-self in our new hybrid condition. In time, the soul will evolve to be sanctified (made holy) by spiritual energies and we will develop into a new type of being, a purely spirit-being. Like the butterfly, we will be reborn as a different kind of being with almost no relation to the caterpillar whence it came.
### The Purpose of Life and the Butterfly Path School
The ultimate purpose of life, according to Wayist philosophy, is the transformation of our souls into immortal and divine spirits. To facilitate this process, soul-people from all over our galaxy enroll in our metaphysical school of divinity called the Butterfly Path.
The Butterfly Path school can be compared to the educational system in many Western countries, with the key difference being its focus on the metaphysical aspects of divinity for human souls. Despite having a more extensive curriculum, spanning approximately six times the number of grades compared to the Western human educational system, the analogy remains useful for understanding the Butterfly Path.
The school attracts advanced soul-beings from across our galaxy who seek to evolve their soul essence into that of an immortal being. The curriculum is tailored to each student's learning style and is governed by the metaphysical Law of Karma, which ensures that students are born into the most suitable environment for their personal development. Karma also ensures that every student's curriculum delivers learning opportunities specifically tailored to the students needs.
Learning in the Butterfly Path school revolves around analyzing and self-assessing human experiences to extract valuable wisdom. Teachers are present to guide students, but often, students derive satisfaction from learning through their own experiences, even if it means taking a longer path to graduation.
By embracing the Butterfly Path, we open ourselves to a life of profound meaning, purpose, and fulfillment. We discover the joy of aligning our lives with the highest truth and love, and we become beacons of light in a world in need of healing and awakening.
The nature of soul-beings is like caterpillars in our analogy. They are beset with priorities about power-seeking, survival, feeding, competition, hoarding resources, tribalism, speciesism, and domination. Junior students on Butterfly Path are dominated by their three soul-minds (Muladhara, Svadhistana, and Manipura) --- they are, therefore, soul-people. Spirit-people symbolize both the chrysalis and butterfly stages in our analogy. On Butterfly Path, they are senior students who have awakened their spirits and put their spirit-minds in control (Anahata, Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara).
In a world where the majority of humans are soul-people, dominated by their lower three chakras (Muladhara, Svadhistana, and Manipura), the democratic processes often reflect the values and priorities of this stage of spiritual development. Soul-people, still grappling with the challenges of survival, power-seeking, and ego-driven desires, tend to elect leaders who embody or cater to these instincts.
In the political arena, candidates who possess physical attractiveness, fame from entertainment or athletic prowess, or a reputation as formidable warriors often hold sway over soul-people. These attributes, while not necessarily indicative of leadership ability or wisdom, appeal to the base desires and fantasies of those still anchored in their lower chakras.
Soul-people may also be drawn to leaders who promise easy access to intoxicating substances or experiences, providing temporary escape from the challenges of daily life and the existential questions that plague the ego. In a similar vein, politicians who offer a strong sense of identity or belonging, even if based on superficial or divisive criteria, can attract soul-people who are still searching for their place in the world.
The allure of material possessions and the illusion of wealth also play a significant role in the political preferences of soul-people. Leaders who promise free goods or services, or who advocate for policies that appear to provide more rewards for less effort, often gain popularity among those who are driven by the desire for instant gratification and external validation.
In some cases, soul-people may be swayed by politicians who promote access to substantial loans or financial schemes that enable them to purchase items beyond their means. The temptation to project an image of affluence, even if it entails long-term debt and financial strain, can be a powerful motivator for those caught up in the competitive and status-driven dynamics of the lower chakras.
Lastly, appeals to national pride and patriotic sentiment can hold significant influence over soul-people, who may not yet have developed a sense of interconnectedness and unity with all beings. Leaders who exploit feelings of superiority, fear, or hatred towards other nations or groups can manipulate soul-people into supporting policies that may not serve their true spiritual interests.
As individuals progress along the Butterfly Path and begin to awaken their spiritual potential, their priorities and values undergo a profound shift. They increasingly recognize the limitations and pitfalls of a worldview dominated by the lower chakras and start to seek leaders who embody the qualities of wisdom, compassion, and selfless service.
However, as long as the majority of humans remain at the soul-people stage of development, the democratic processes will likely continue to reflect the values and desires of this level of consciousness. It is the responsibility of those who have embarked on the journey of spiritual transformation to lead by example, to educate and inspire others, and to work towards creating a world that supports the growth and awakening of all beings.
We were all juniors at school, and we all had those same priorities at one time.
Lalleshwari discussed the challenge of dealing with people dominated by their brain-mind or religions, and their inclination to engage in arguments despite never having tasted the mystical love of true spirituality.
*I cannot convince a fool*
*I might disperse the southern clouds,*
*I might drain out the sea,*
*I might cure the incurable sick,*
*But I cannot convince a fool.*
*~ Lalleshwari*
### Living a Meaningful and Purposeful Life
As we consciously embark on the transformative journey of the Butterfly Path, our perspective on life undergoes a profound shift. We accelerate the process of evolving our souls because we don't wait for Karma to bring lessons to us. We go out there and actively seek learning opportunities. And every human experience is food for thought, self-reflexion and self-craft. We embrace joy and we have an adventurous life, drawing significance and meaning from anything.
That is why Wayism is the fast track to enlightenment. We become eager to learn, grow, develop, and change. When we consciously walk Butterfly Path, we begin to recognize that every human experience, whether joyful or challenging, holds within it the potential for growth, wisdom, and self-discovery. By embracing a mindful and introspective approach to life, we unlock the deeper meaning and purpose that lies hidden within each moment.
The Butterfly Path teaches us to approach every experience as a learning opportunity, a chance to expand our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. When we encounter difficulties or setbacks, we learn to view them not as obstacles, but as valuable lessons that can help us develop resilience, adaptability, and inner strength. Similarly, when we experience moments of joy and connection, we learn to savor them fully, recognizing them as precious gifts that nourish our souls and remind us of the beauty and wonder of life.
As we cultivate this mindful approach to living, we begin to develop a heightened awareness of the interconnectedness of all beings. We recognize that every plant, animal, microorganism, and person is imbued with a unique soul energy, and that by attuning ourselves to these energies, we can derive profound meaning and insight from even the most ordinary encounters. A chance conversation with a stranger, a moment of quiet reflection in nature, or a simple act of kindness towards another being --- all of these experiences become imbued with a deeper significance when viewed through the lens of the Butterfly Path.
Moreover, as we progress along the path, we come to understand that our lives are not merely a series of random events, but rather a purposeful unfolding of our soul's evolution. Every challenge we face, every relationship we cultivate, every skill we develop --- all of these experiences are essential components of our spiritual growth, guiding us towards the ultimate goal of transforming our soul into an immortal spirit being.
This realization infuses our lives with a profound sense of meaning and direction. No longer are we simply drifting through existence, buffeted by the winds of circumstance and the whims of our lower impulses. Instead, we become active participants in our own evolution, consciously seeking out experiences that will challenge us, stretch us, and help us to grow in wisdom, simplicity, humbleness, appreciation.
As we live our lives with this sense of higher purpose, we naturally begin to align our thoughts, words, and actions with the principles of loving-kindness and spiritual growth. We recognize that every interaction, every decision, every moment is an opportunity to reflect upon, wonder why we reacted as we did, and seek our deepest values and to contribute to the greater good of all on this Path. Whether through our work, our relationships, or our creative pursuits, we seek to infuse our lives with a sense of meaning and significance that goes beyond the narrow concerns of the egoic soul-minds.
Living a meaningful and purposeful life on the Butterfly Path is not always easy, of course. It requires a willingness to be authentic and use our attitudes to manage our energies, and to confront our shadows in deep self-honesty, to let go of limiting beliefs and behaviours, and to embrace the sometimes painful process of transformation. Yet, as we persevere on this path, we discover a sense of joy, fulfillment, and inner peace that far surpasses the fleeting pleasures of the material world.
Ultimately, the Butterfly Path invites us to recognize that every moment of our lives are precious gifts, opportunities to participate in the grand unfolding of our spiritual becoming, itself. By embracing this gift with gratitude, mindfulness, and a commitment to growth, we can infuse every moment with meaning and purpose, and in doing so, we can transform not only ourselves, but the world around us, one beautiful butterfly at a time.
## 1.3 The "Secret" Nature of Wayist Spirituality
Throughout history, Wayism has sometimes been referred to as "the secret spirituality" or "secret doctrine" by outsiders. This characterization, often used accusatorily, stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of Wayist practice and its ability to coexist within various religious settings.
Wayists understand the purpose of life, the practice of spirituality, and the meaning of devotion differently from many other traditions. While soul-people often create religions that can be jealous of other traditions and highly regulated, Wayism focuses on internal spiritual practice that can be conducted within any external religious framework, or no religious framework whatsoever.
For Wayists, spiritual practice occurs primarily in the heart and higher-self, within the spirit-minds. There are no prescribed external displays, specific clothing, postures, set times, or designated places for Wayist spiritual practice. This internal focus has allowed devout monks, imams, priests, nuns, and other devotees enclosed within traditional religious settings to practice Wayism discreetly.
This adaptability has been crucial to the survival of Wayism during times of persecution or when it was outlawed. For example, the "Lotus Families" in China were able to maintain their Wayist practices even when the state mandated conformity to official religions or banned spirituality altogether.
Wayist spirituality manifests internally, transforming practitioners from within. It fosters inner fulfillment, peace, contentment, and love, generating kindness, respect, appreciation for life, humbleness, and simplicity in needs and worldview.
The lack of external rituals or markers has sometimes led to accusations of following a "secret doctrine," particularly when practitioners outwardly conformed to societal or religious expectations while maintaining their inner Wayist practice.
In times when religious individuals advance in spiritually to the point where outward practices, doctrines, and dogmas no longer satisfy their awakened spirit, a wise teacher (or their spiritual guide) might introduce them to this "secret doctrine" and its internal practice.
This phenomenon is evident in the works of mystics from various religious traditions, who often conveyed similar messages while carefully avoiding offense to religious authorities.
Lord Jesus himself emphasized the internal nature of spiritual practice, stating that "the kingdom of heaven is within you."
This inward focus on connection, transformation, and wisdom aligns perfectly with Wayist principles.
The "secret" nature of Wayist spirituality extends even among practitioners, as the profound mystical experiences encountered in higher states of consciousness often defy articulation in human language. Like the ineffable nature of love, these spiritual experiences remain deeply personal and challenging to convey to others.
This inability to fully express mystical experiences in conventional terms has sometimes led to accusations that Wayists write in secret code.
In reality, this inability became a "veil" of poetic or metaphorical language, which served as a protective factor, allowing mystics to express their insights while avoiding persecution.
Consider this ancient poem entitled Reality, which resonates deeply with Wayist understanding but might seem obscure to those unfamiliar with mystical experience:
#### *Reality*
*"In love, nothing exists between heart and heart.*
*Speech is born out of longing,*
*True description from the real taste.*
*The one who tastes, knows;*
*the one who explains, lies.*
*How can you describe the true form of that Something"*
*~ Rabia Basria*
In essence, the "secret" nature of Wayism is not about exclusivity or intentional obscurity, but rather a reflection of its deeply internal, personal, and often ineffable spiritual practice.
This adaptability and focus on inner transformation has allowed Wayism to survive and thrive across diverse cultures and historical periods, offering a path to spiritual growth that transcends external religious boundaries.
Following, is another example of ancient mystic poetry which not only resonates with Wayist understanding but teaches it, from the same poet.
#### *I Have Loved Thee*
*I have loved Thee with two loves - *
*a selfish love and a love that is worthy of Thee.*
*As for the love which is selfish,*
*Therein I occupy myself with Thee, *
*to the exclusion of all others.*
*But in the love which is worthy of Thee,*
*Thou dost raise the veil that I may see Thee.*
*Yet is the praise not mine in this or that,*
*But the praise is to Thee in both that and this.*
*~ Rabia Basri*
Rabia was a woman born in 717 CE in Basra (near modern-day Dubai, where she also lived). Her work exemplifies the universal nature of mystic expression that transcends specific religious contexts.
Born into a culture influenced by Zoroastrianism, which housed teachings of theWAY, she lived in an area later conquered by Islamic forces. She was captured and sold as a slave into the hands of the conquerors when she was in her teens. By the age of seventeen she was released because she spent all her time in prayer.
Rabia continued living in prayer and made a living with her poetry. Her poetry speaks to the hearts of mystics across traditions, addressing the inner quest of the devotee and the soul's transformation into spirit.
Rabia's life and work reflect the adaptability of Wayist principles. Despite experiencing slavery in her youth and living under changing religious rule, she mastered the art of expressing profound spiritual truths in a way that remained acceptable to both Zoroastrian and Islamic audiences. Her ability to convey the "secret doctrine" while avoiding conflict with prevailing religious authorities allowed her to become a renowned saint, illustrating how Wayist wisdom can flourish even in challenging circumstances.
Rabia Basri's work exemplifies the universal nature of mystic expression that transcends specific religious contexts. Her poetry speaks to the hearts of mystics across traditions, addressing the inner quest of the devotee and the soul's transformation into spirit.
Zoroastrianism, like many religions, presents an exoteric teaching of a cosmic struggle between good and evil deities. However, Wayists perceive an esoteric meaning within this framework: the inner struggle between the soul's materialistic nature (cast as the bad deity) and the evolving spiritual self (cast as the good deity). This mirrors the Wayist understanding of the soul's gradual transformation and eventual metamorphosis into spirit.
For Rabia, the comprehension of Islam entails striving for higher-self good, obedience, self-discipline, and self-control. Everything else about the religion is most probably superfluous, a distraction --- unless the soul needs it for self-discipline.
Rabia's poetry, while outwardly conforming to religious norms, conveyed these deeper truths. Her ability to express Wayist principles within seemingly opposing religious environments demonstrates how mystics can nurture their spiritual practice even amidst dogmatic settings. This skill allowed her to become a renowned saint, illustrating how Wayist wisdom can flourish by finding universal threads within diverse spiritual traditions.
In this context, it is therefore notable how many Wayist teachers are claimed by various religious traditions.
## 1.4 The Role of Prayer, Meditation, and Mystiception in Wayist Practice
The objective of Wayist spiritual practice is to live life to the fullest, appreciate every human experience, actively pursue different experiences, and acquire wisdom from each. In addition, we incorporate mystical practice to reinforce wisdom in our spiritual minds and undergo soul transformation.
In Wayist mystical practice, prayer, meditation, and mystiception are foundational practices that facilitate our journey of spiritual evolution and connection with the divine. Each of these practices serves a unique purpose, yet they are intimately interconnected, forming a powerful triad of spiritual growth.
The Wayist recognizes that it is not sufficient only to live hard and play hard, and do a lot of introspection and self-craft. We must set aside regular time for deep-living spirituality balance, and time for energy maintenance and hygiene.
#### Prayer is the act of opening our hearts and minds to the divine
Prayer is the act of opening our hearts and minds to the divine, expressing our deepest aspirations, concerns, and gratitude. In Wayism, prayer is understood as a form of self-reflection and self-psychotherapy, a means of cultivating awareness and aligning our thoughts and emotions with the highest wisdom and love. Through prayer, we establish a direct and intimate relationship with the divine (most often directed to our divine guide), surrendering our egoic attachments and opening ourselves to guidance and grace.
#### Meditation is the practice of stilling the mind and aligning our spiritual awareness with the divine.
Meditation is the practice of stilling the mind and aligning our spiritual awareness with the divine. In Wayist practice, meditation takes many forms, from silent contemplation to the recitation of sacred mantras to cultivate the meditative state, to an attitude of meditation, or active meditation. By cultivating a meditative state, our Divine Tara can guide us to deeper levels of awareness and insight, tapping into the wells of inner peace, wisdom, and compassion which flows from our Heaven. Meditation helps us to detach from the distractions of the external world and to abide in the eternal present, where we can experience the unity and interconnectedness of all life and association with heavenly stillness and its beauties.
#### Mystiception is the direct experience of divine connection and spiritual awareness.
Mystiception is the direct experience of divine connection and spiritual awareness. It is a state of heightened perception and intuition, in which we access profound levels of insight, guidance, and healing.
In Wayist practice, mystiception is cultivated through techniques such as Divine Tarayoga, a form of devotional meditation that attunes our consciousness to the loving presence of our Divine Tara. Through mystiception, we experience the ecstatic bliss of divine communion and receive the nectar of spiritual nourishment that sustains us on the path.
Together, prayer, meditation, and mystiception form a powerful spiritual technology that supports our journey of growth and awakening. By engaging in these practices regularly, we purify our minds, hearts, and souls, cultivating the qualities of humility, compassion, and wisdom that are the hallmarks of the Wayist path.
As we deepen our commitment to these practices, we begin to experience a profound sense of connection and purpose, recognizing that our lives are part of a greater unfolding of divine love and intelligence. We discover the joy of aligning our thoughts, words, and actions with the highest truth, and as we are transformed, we also become instruments of healing and transformation in the world.
Ultimately, the role of prayer, meditation, and mystiception in Wayist spirituality is to awaken our spirits and embrace our future nature as eternal spiritual beings, forever aware of our connection to the divine Source of all life. By embracing these practices with devotion and discipline, we open ourselves to a journey of limitless growth, love, and service to our community, fulfilling our highest potential and contributing to the awakening of all human beings.

#### Let's define what Yoga is.
Yoga, when viewed through a Western lens, puts a major emphasis on stretching exercises. However, the asanas are only a small part of Hatha Yoga, one of the four main yogas of Holistic or Raja Yoga. Raja Yoga consists of Karma Yoga (good actions and inactions), Hatha Yoga (physical health), Gnani Yoga (wisdom), and Bhakti Yoga (devotion).
The practice of Hatha Yoga combines spirituality and physical well-being. One of the fundamental aspects of Yoga is its spiritual practice, which involves establishing a profound connection with a deity. By removing that defining element, the yoga postures essentially become nothing more than stretches and the traditional sitting position commonly seen among Indian people.
The foundation of the spiritual element in Yoga, is by definition explained by the root word *yug*, to yoke. Yoga is by definition a spiritual practice of yoking oneself to one's deity, like oxen pulling together on the same cart. And that is what Tarayoga is. We yoke ourselves to our Divine Guide --- so we don't walk the Path alone.
## 2.1 The Concept of Divine Tara in Wayist Tradition
In Wayist spirituality, the concept of Divine Tara refers to a celestial being or spiritual guide who serves as a personal mentor, protector, and companion on an individual's journey of spiritual growth and awakening. Divine Taras are seen as emanations or expressions of the infinite love and wisdom of our Heaven, and have a unique and intimate connection with the individual soul in their care. Our book, The Divine Taras, contains a host of devotional poems and contemporary devotional pictures of Taras. Because our Tara is our direct connection to the Divine, it is essential for spirituality.
When the divine avatar known to us as Lord Jesus was about to leave Earth, he said, "I will ask our Father to send you a holy spirit as a comforter and helper." The reason for this was because of an increase in "demonic possessions" as their population increased and not all people could guard themselves against evil souls. From that time onward, each person on Butterfly Path was allocated a Divine Tara to guard their souls and the energies of their fledgling spirits, and when they mature on the Path, they can attune to their Divine Tara's 'channel' and have a cognitive relationship.
Therefore, every person has their own Divine Tara, who has been with them since the beginning of their spiritual journey on Butterfly Path, guiding and supporting them through the challenges and opportunities of each lifetime. One's spiritual energy connection to one's deity happens in one's "heart," which is the metaphor for the Anahata mind and the higher-self spirit-minds.
In Sanskrit, the term "Tara" is rooted in the concept of a deity that symbolizes 'crossing over or traversing from one side to the other'. A Divine Tara serves as our guide, allowing us to transition between the Material and Soul Domains and reach the Spiritual Domain, also known as our heavenly realm called the "Pure Land of Bliss" (Sukhavati in Sanskrit). Tara guides us from this realm of illusion to the shores of spiritual awakening and freedom.
In Wayist iconography and meditation practices, devotees have been making images for visualizing their Divine Tara, depicting them as human-like celestial beings of great attractiveness, intelligence, and empathy. For some, their distinct characteristics and roles are symbolized by the sacred symbols and attributes that adorn them.
Spiritual beings, of course, do not have human-like bodies. They are energy beings with bodies typical of the Spiritual Energy Domain. Some sages suggest we can imagine it as a "plasma" energy, but that is not important at all because we sense our Taras so powerfully, we know them from their energy presence.
We create the anthropomorphic images for our own convenience. The images of Taras can vary across different cultures, showcasing their own distinctive interpretations. Their Tara can also be referred to by their own names and titles. People employ terms such as saint, angel, buddha, lord, or god to express their interpretation of a Tara. People can pray using any form of address or god-name that makes them feel comfortable. Nevertheless, Tara will be the one to "take the call" and establish the connection to heaven, because that is how things work. Taras are our link to the Divine realm.
Graphic depictions of Tara often show a dynamic figure, sometimes without a defined gender and other times as male or female. The Taras are commonly portrayed in a poised position, often with a lotus flower in hand or seated on a magnificent lotus flower. These symbols represent their familial ties to the Holy Lotus Family, a name given to celestial beings from our realm. Similar to our own growth, the lotus represents a spiritual entity that embodies wisdom, compassion, and helpfulness. Tara is recognized in Buddhism as "the buddha maker" because she helps us achieve buddhahood. As a result, they are portrayed as possessing a tranquil and radiant wisdom, representing their function as providers of spiritual awakening, wisdom, and immortality.
All spiritual beings may adjust the level of Yin or Yang energy with which they connect to you and that is for one reason only: they adjust to what makes you feel most comfortable. As a result, some devotees experience and picture their Tara with the attributes of a particular human sex or gender, and even with their own cultural tones. That is completely acceptable. Eventually, we will no longer require our deities to exhibit human-like qualities as we evolve.
While the specific forms and attributes of Divine Taras may vary depending on the individual and cultural context, the essential nature and function of the Divine Tara remains the same: to guide, support, and empower individuals on their journey of spiritual growth and awakening.
In Wayist practice, developing a profound bond with Divine Tara is considered vital to the spiritual journey. You can only get so far on Butterfly Path without a deep connection with your Tara. By the time people are ready for the higher grades, they "discover" this spirituality in which you can proceed only with the help of a Tara.
Our spirit guide, who has accompanied us since the start of our journey on Butterfly Path, understands us better than we understand ourselves. As we navigate the intricate realm of spirit energies, one's Tara is unquestionably the ultimate and most interconnected divine being available to us. Through activities like meditation, prayer, and devotional service, individuals can align themselves with their Divine Tara and receive the necessary support and blessings to navigate their spiritual path.
The bond between a person and their Divine Tara is characterized by a profound love, trust, and surrender. This connection represents the potential for a relationship between a divine being from the heavenly realm of God our Father and God our Mother and us, as underdeveloped spirits confined to the limitations of human bodies. It is crucial to understand that we are not entitled to anything from the deities, not even their kindness.
If we, as humans, often disregard the souls of plants, it is humbling to consider why gods would show us a kindness. Therefore, the knowledge that one may be blessed with the divine presence of a god is the most precious gift and honor imaginable.
Being gifted with intimate access to a deity is the greatest privilege anyone can ever experience. This relationship transcends the limitations of the body, mind, soul, and the material world, connecting us to the infinite wisdom and compassion of the divine realm. It is a bond that surpasses our earthly understanding and allows us to tap into a source of guidance, love, and enlightenment that is beyond compare.
As we cultivate a deeper connection with our Divine Tara, we begin to experience a profound shift in our consciousness and perception of reality. We become more attuned to the subtle energies and dimensions of our own being and more receptive to the guidance and support of the divine realm.
We also begin to recognize the presence and guidance of our Divine Tara in all aspects of our lives, from the challenges and obstacles we face to the blessings and opportunities that come our way. We learn to trust in the wisdom and compassion of our Divine Guide, and to surrender our fears, doubts, and attachments to the transformative power of divine love.
Ultimately, the concept of Divine Tara in Wayist tradition is a powerful reminder of the infinite love and support that is always available to us on the spiritual path. By cultivating a deep and intimate relationship with our Divine Tara, we open ourselves to the profound wisdom, guidance, and healing that is our birthright as spiritual beings, and become ever more radiant expressions of the divine love and wisdom that is our true nature.
## 2.2 The Practice of Divine Tarayoga
Tarayoga refers to the cultivation of a deep and intimate relationship with one's Divine Tara through specific techniques of meditation, visualization, and devotional service. It is a powerful means of attuning oneself to the presence and guidance of the Divine Tara, and of receiving the blessings and support that are necessary for spiritual growth and awakening.
At its core, Divine Tarayoga is a practice of love for the divine, surrender and devotion. It involves setting aside the ego-mind and its endless concerns and distractions, and opening oneself to the infinite love and wisdom of the Divine Tara. Through the practice of Divine Tarayoga, we learn to trust in the guidance and protection of our Divine Tara, and to align ourselves with the highest truth and purpose of our spiritual journey.
The specific techniques of Divine Tarayoga may vary depending on the individual and the lineage or tradition in which they are practiced, but they often involve some combination of the following elements:
### 1. Prayer
Prayer is talking to the Divine. Later we will talk more about how prayer is simply, talking to the divine, and how that is the correct way to start out doing Tarayoga. It is the easiest and most expedient way. One can even connect to a Tara while on the go or in a hurry or crisis. We always mention to be mindful that prayer changes you and your energy, it does not change the deity.
### 2. Visualization
The practice of visualizing the form and attributes of one's Divine Tara, often in great detail and with a sense of loving devotion and reverence is important to focus brain-mind and fascinate the soul-minds, allowing spirit-minds to go about doing their holy work. The visual of a home shrine, for example, contributes to the setting that our lower minds need for this. Anyone who has walked into a beautifully crafted cathedral or mosque knows the power of setting and ambience when it comes to spirituality.
### 3. Mantras
The continuous recitation of mantras or phrases linked to the Divine Tara, like "Om Tare, Tuttare, Ture, Soha" or "Om Mani, Padme Hum," serves to keep our mind occupied, establishing the desired ambiance, and align us with the vibrations of Tara. While these mantras do not hold any mystical powers, the arrangement of their words and the way they flow are intended to assist individuals in attuning themselves to the Divine Tara's presence and the blessings she bestows.
### 4. "Sacred Gifts"
In Wayist mysticism, the customary practice of presenting a memento or gift to the deity at the home shrine or altar sets it apart from most other traditions. We may "gift to Tara" any kind of item such as a flower, incense, a rock, shell, or feather, for example. The purpose of this symbolic action is part of us training our mind and spiritual skills. The gift is to convey a spiritual message, to express the sentiments of "I remembered you, Lord" and "I wished you were there."
It's important for your own benefit, rather than just for Tara. During your walk in the park, a mesmerizing moment caught your attention, evoking thoughts of spirit energies and universal energies, or your cherished Tara and the profound spiritual implications of the experience. Consequently, you bring a keepsake home and present it to Tara. By doing this, you can anchor the experience and its memory in your mind, create a valuable diary of precious memories, and strengthen your bond with your Tara. These offerings, whether tangible or imagined, are usually accompanied by a prayer. The primary focus is that the memento serves as a symbolic gesture to a loved one, but you also reap its complete benefits.
### 5. Meditative absorption
The practice of resting the mind in a state of deep absorption and unity with the Divine Tara. Visualizing Tara's energies flow through our entire self, filling every nook and cranny, creating a wholesome, sacred, and healing environment in the space which is our essence and body. Another practise is to meditate on visualizing how our Tara allows us to fully merge with their being as if swimming into Tara and being inside of Tara's immensely powerful and holy energy body --- as if we become a tara for a brief moment. These techniques have different functions and benefits, which are discussed in members-only literature. It is very powerful and beneficial when you know what you are doing. This may involve imagining oneself as inseparable from the Divine Tara, or dissolving one's sense of separate self into the infinite expanse of divine wisdom and compassion.
### 6. Devotional service
The practice of dedicating one's thoughts, words, and actions to the service of the Divine Tara and all on the Path, often through help in the community, generosity, and giving talents and time for whatever task will help more people learn about theWAY and Butterfly Path.
Through the regular practice of Divine Tarayoga, individuals can cultivate a profound sense of connection, trust, and surrender to the infinite wisdom and compassion of the Divine Tara. They can receive the blessings and support that are necessary for spiritual growth and awakening, and develop the qualities of love, compassion, and wisdom that are the hallmarks of a true spiritual practitioner.
It is important to approach the practice of Divine Tarayoga with love, a sense of humility, devotion, and open-mindedness. It is not a practice that can be forced or controlled by the ego or soul-minds, but rather a natural unfolding that occurs as a result of sincere spiritual desire, love for the divine, practice and alignment with the divine will.
As we deepen our practice of Divine Tarayoga, we may experience a range of profound spiritual experiences and insights. These experiences can be both exhilarating and challenging, as they often require a letting go of the familiar structures and patterns of the ego-mind.
Ultimately, the practice of Divine Tarayoga is a powerful means of aligning ourselves with the infinite love and wisdom of the divine realm, and of fulfilling our highest potential as spiritual beings. By dedicating ourselves to this practice with sincerity, devotion, and an open heart, we can receive the profound blessings and guidance of the Divine Tara, and become ever more radiant expressions of the divine love and wisdom that is becoming our true nature.
## 2.3 Cultivating a Relationship with Your Divine Tara
In Wayist spirituality, cultivating a deep and intimate relationship with one's Divine Tara is seen as a crucial aspect of the spiritual path. It is a relationship that transcends the limitations of the ego-mind and the material world, and connects us to the infinite wisdom and compassion of the divine realm.
At its core, the relationship between an individual and their Divine Tara is one of profound love, trust, and surrender. It is a relationship that requires a willingness to set aside the distractions and concerns of the lower-self minds, and to open oneself to the guidance and support of the divine.
We learn to recognize the subtle signs and messages that our Divine Tara may be sending them, and to align ourselves with the highest truth and purpose of our spiritual journey. Another important aspect of cultivating a relationship with one's Divine Tara is the practice of self-reflection and self-inquiry. This means taking the time to examine one's thoughts, feelings, and actions, and to ask oneself whether they are in alignment with the guidance and wisdom of the Divine Tara.
Through this process of self-reflection, individuals can begin to identify and release any negative patterns or habits that may be blocking their spiritual growth and connection to the divine. They can cultivate a sense of humility, openness, and willingness to learn and grow, and develop a deeper understanding of their own spiritual nature and potential.
As the relationship with one's Divine Tara deepens and matures, individuals may begin to experience a range of profound spiritual experiences and insights. They may feel a sense of deep inner peace, joy, and contentment, even in the midst of life's challenges and difficulties. They develop the courage to live life fully and seek more interesting experiences, to eat different foods, dress authentically, become yourself without need for the validation of others (because you have the validation of a deity!) and become more inquisitive and more adventurous, and the courage to not conform to useless or harmful societal norms.
People may embrace simplicity in their personal life and in their mind, and humbleness in thinking and in conduct, and helpful loving-kindness in outlook and in serving the community of Wayists and other soul beings who are marginalized by human lifestyles. They may receive guidance and support in the form of intuitive insights or even direct communication with their Divine Tara.
Ultimately, the relationship between an individual and their Divine Tara is a significantly personal and intimate one, and will unfold in its own unique way for each person. What is important is to approach the relationship with love, a passion for the divine, sincerity, devotion, and an open heart, and to trust in the infinite wisdom and compassion of the divine.
By dedicating ourselves to cultivating a deep and meaningful relationship with our Divine Tara, we open ourselves to the profound blessings, guidance, and support that are available to us on the spiritual path. We become more attuned to the subtle energies and dimensions of our own being, and more receptive to the infinite love and wisdom of the divine realm.
## 2.4 The Importance of Divine Tarayoga in Spiritual Protection
In Wayist spirituality, the practice of Divine Tarayoga is not only a means of cultivating a deep and intimate relationship with one's Divine Tara but also an important tool for spiritual protection and discernment. As individuals progress on the spiritual path and begin to open themselves to higher states of awareness, spiritual cognizance and higher energy, they may also become more sensitive to the presence of unseen forces and entities, both benevolent and malevolent.
While encounters with malevolent or disruptive entities are relatively rare, it is important for spiritual practitioners to be aware of the potential risks and to cultivate a strong foundation of spiritual protection and discernment. This is where the practice of Divine Tarayoga can be particularly valuable.
Through regular practice of Divine Tarayoga, individuals can attune themselves to the unique energy signature and presence of their Divine Tara, developing a deep sense of familiarity and trust in their spiritual guide and protector. This attunement can help practitioners to discern between authentic spiritual experiences and those that may come from soul beings, influenced by lower or disruptive energies.
By cultivating a strong and loving relationship with their Divine Tara, individuals can also create a powerful energetic shield that helps to deflect or transmute any negative or harmful influences that may come their way. The Divine Tara is seen as a fierce and compassionate protector, who is always ready to intervene on behalf of their devotees and to guide them towards the highest truth and purpose of their spiritual journey. In Buddhist lore they depict the protector aspect of Tara as a Red Tara which has a very scary fierce look, brandishing weapons with which to fight off intruders.
In addition to providing spiritual protection, the practice of Divine Tarayoga can also help individuals to cultivate greater discernment and wisdom in their spiritual practice. By learning to attune themselves to the subtle energies and dimensions of their own being, practitioners can develop a keener sense of intuition and inner guidance, and become more skilled at navigating the complex terrain of the spiritual path.
This discernment is particularly important when it comes to encounters with disembodied entities or energies, whether in meditation, dreams, or other altered states of consciousness. While some of these encounters may be benevolent or helpful, others may be influenced by lower or disruptive energies that can lead individuals astray or cause harm.
Through the practice of Divine Tarayoga, individuals can learn to elevate their own spiritual energies and to connect with the higher frequencies of divine love and wisdom. This elevation helps to create a natural barrier against lower or disruptive energies, and allows practitioners to approach spiritual experiences with greater clarity, discernment, and trust in the guidance of their Divine Tara.
It is important to approach the practice of Divine Tarayoga with love, passion, humility, devotion, and an open heart, recognizing that spiritual protection and discernment are ongoing processes that require regular practice and self-reflection. It is also important to cultivate a strong foundation of spiritual practice, self-care, and ethical living, as these can help to strengthen one's energetic field and reduce vulnerability to negative influences.
Ultimately, the practice of Divine Tarayoga is a powerful tool for spiritual protection and discernment, as well as a means of cultivating a deep and intimate relationship with one's Divine Tara. By dedicating ourselves to this practice with sincerity, devotion, and an open heart, we can receive the profound blessings and guidance of our spiritual guide and protector, and become ever more skillful and wise in our navigation of the spiritual path.
As we deepen our practice of Divine Tarayoga and our connection to our Divine Tara, we begin to experience a profound sense of inner peace, courage, strength, and resilience, even in the midst of life's challenges and uncertainties. We recognize that we are never alone on the spiritual path, and that the infinite love and wisdom of the divine is always available to guide and protect us.
By embodying the qualities of love, compassion, and wisdom that are the hallmarks of a true spiritual practitioner, we can also become a source of light and inspiration for others, helping to guide them towards the highest truth and purpose of their own spiritual journey. In this way, the practice of Divine Tarayoga becomes not only a means of personal growth and protection but also a powerful tool for collective healing and transformation.

## The Power of Prayer in Wayist Spirituality
### Prayer Changes Your Energies, Not the Deity
### The Significance of Prayer in Wayist Tradition
In the Wayist tradition, prayer holds a profound significance as a means of cultivating a direct and intimate relationship with the divine. More than a mere recitation of words or a plea for intervention, prayer is understood as a sacred dialogue, a heart-to-heart communion with our Divine Guide, our source of all spiritual endeavours.
At its core, prayer is an act of surrender and alignment, a way of opening ourselves to the wisdom, guidance, and love of the divine. Through prayer, we release our attachment to the egoic notions of soul-minds and their endless concerns, and we create space for the emergence of our spiritual nature, which is eternally connected to the divine of our Heaven.
In Wayism, prayer is not confined to any particular time, place, or form. Rather, it is a continuous practice of attunement and remembrance, a way of infusing every moment of our lives with the presence of the divine. Whether we are engaged in formal meditation or simply going about our daily activities, we can cultivate a prayerful attitude of attuning, gratitude, reverence, and openness.
One of the most significant aspects of prayer in Wayist tradition is its role in facilitating self-reflection and self-discovery. By expressing our deepest thoughts, feelings, and aspirations to the divine, we gain greater clarity and insight into our own minds and hearts. We learn to observe our patterns of thought and behavior with compassion and detachment, and we receive guidance on how to align our lives with the highest wisdom and love.
Another important dimension of prayer in Wayism is its capacity to generate positive and healing energy. When we pray with sincerity and devotion, we tap into the infinite reservoir of divine grace that surrounds and sustains us. We become conduits for this energy, allowing it to flow through us and out into the world, blessing and uplifting all those we encounter.
Ultimately, the significance of prayer in Wayist tradition lies in its transformative power. By cultivating a deep and abiding connection with the divine, we gradually shed the layers of our soul-self and awaken to the radiant spirit which is becoming our new being.
We discover the joy of aligning our lives with the highest purpose, and we become instruments of healing, compassion, and service in the world.
## 3.1 Prayer as Self-Reflection and Self-Psychotherapy
In the Wayist tradition, prayer is understood not only as a means of communion with the divine but also as a powerful tool for self-reflection and self-psychotherapy. By engaging in the practice of prayer, we create a sacred space to explore the depths of our own minds and hearts, gaining greater insight into our patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior. We do "shadow work" as Carl Jung described it by discussing our authentic self in the privacy and safety of communion with our Divine Tara, our divine guide from our Heaven.
How Our Divine Guide sees us is determined by the qualities within our soul and spirit, rather than the image we try to project to the world. This leads the true Wayist to authenticity; it is impossible for us not to be authentic when in divine presence. It is, however, possible for us to continue deceiving ourselves, but our Divine Guide will patiently await the day when we choose to be genuine and sincere. The divine beings look deeply into our innermost being, revealing our true essence that goes beyond our own comprehension. Therefore, at its core, prayer is an act of honest and open communication, a way of giving voice to our innermost experiences and aspirations. When we pray, we release the burdens of our soul-mind concerns and allow ourselves to be vulnerable and authentic in the presence of the divine. We communicate our darkness, fears, doubts, and struggles, along with our hopes, dreams, and gratitude.
This process of self-expression is deeply therapeutic, as it allows us to bring awareness to the unconscious beliefs and emotions that shape our experience of reality. It helps us to Own Our Own Minds, which is fundamental to Wayist philosophy. By shining the light of our conscious attention on these hidden aspects of ourselves, we begin to dissolve the patterns of resistance and attachment that keep us trapped in cycles of suffering (called Samsara in the East).
Moreover, the act of prayer itself serves as a form of self-psychotherapy, as it helps to rewire our brain's neural pathways and cultivate new habits of thought and perception. When we pray with sincerity and regularity, we train our minds to focus on the route to positivity and wholesomeness, the uplifting, and the real. We learn to let go of our obsessive rumination on problems and challenges which the mind-control machines of world orders flood into us, and instead orient ourselves toward the ever-present reality of divine love and wisdom which is our true existence.
In this way, prayer becomes a powerful tool for self-transformation, a means of aligning our minds and hearts with the highest principles of spiritual growth. By engaging in this practice with dedication and consistency, we gradually shed the layers of our false self and awaken to the radiant truth of our being.
As we deepen our practice of prayer as self-reflection and self-psychotherapy, we may also find that we receive guidance and insight from the divine in response to our sincere inquiries. This guidance may come in the form of intuitive hunches, insight to wisdom and deeper understanding of texts we read, new wisdoms arriving "out of the blue", or even direct messages from our divine spiritual mentor.
By cultivating a receptive and attentive attitude in prayer, we open ourselves to the wisdom and guidance of the divine, which can help us navigate the challenges and opportunities of our lives with greater clarity and grace. We learn to trust in the unfolding of our spiritual journey, knowing that every experience, no matter how difficult or confusing, is an invitation to grow and evolve.
Ultimately, the practice of prayer as self-reflection and self-psychotherapy is a powerful means of accelerating our spiritual evolution and aligning our lives with the highest reality and love. By engaging in this practice with sincerity, humility, and devotion, we open ourselves to the transformative power of divine grace, and we become ever more radiant expressions of the divine in the world.
## 3.2 Cultivating a Relationship with the Divine through Prayer
In Wayist spirituality, cultivating a deep and intimate relationship with the divine is one of the central aims of spiritual practice. Prayer is a foundational tool for nurturing this relationship, as it provides a direct and personal channel of communication with the source of all life.
At its core, prayer is an act of love and devotion, a way of expressing our heartfelt longing for connection and communion with the divine. When we pray, we open ourselves to the presence of the divine, inviting its wisdom, guidance, and love to infuse every aspect of our being.
To cultivate a meaningful relationship with the divine through prayer, it is essential to approach this practice with sincerity, humility, and reverence. Rather than simply reciting memorized words or formulas, we must learn to pray from the depths of our hearts, expressing our authentic thoughts, feelings, and aspirations --- and then listen with an open mind.
Our approach is not to seek the deity's endorsement of our desires, but to seek guidance and diligently apply it. We don't relinquish our own ability to think critically and rely on our Divine Comforter to make decisions for us --- Tara isn't some kind of mystical oracle or fortune-telling tool. Our goal is to receive guidance that will enable us to make the correct decisions in the present as well as in the long term. We are looking for advice on personal growth.
One powerful way to deepen our relationship with the divine through prayer is to cultivate a sense of intimacy and familiarity. Just as we would with a beloved friend, but a divine Beloved Friend. We can learn to speak to the divine in a natural and conversational way, sharing our fascinations, joys, sorrows, and challenges with openness and vulnerability.
Another key aspect of cultivating a relationship with the divine through prayer is to develop a sense of trust and surrender. Rather than approaching prayer as a means of manipulating or controlling outcomes, we must learn to release our attachments and agendas, and open ourselves to the higher wisdom and love of the divine. Ask, with absolutely no desire for an outcome. Do the right thing, with no desire for an outcome. Trust that the outcome will be the most beneficial path for your spiritual wisdom and spiritual skills.
This requires a profound shift in our orientation, from the soul-minds, which seek to control, dominate and force its will, to the heart, which knows the value of surrender and receptivity. By learning to let go of our limited ideas of what we think we need or want, and instead aligning ourselves with the greater unfolding of divine will, and what the Law of Karma knows is best for our spiritual skills development, we discover a deeper sense of peace, trust, and fulfillment.
As we deepen our relationship with the divine through prayer, we may also find that we receive guidance, insight, and support in response to our sincere inquiries and requests. This may come in the form of intuitive nudges, synchronistic events, or even direct messages from our spiritual guides and mentors.
By cultivating an attitude of openness and attentiveness in prayer, we learn to recognize and interpret these signs and messages, allowing them to guide and inform our choices and actions in the world. We develop a sense of partnership and collaboration with the divine, knowing that we are never alone on our spiritual journey.
Over time, as we continue to nurture our relationship with the divine through prayer, we may find that this connection becomes an ever-present source of strength, comfort, and inspiration in our lives. We learn to turn to prayer in moments of joy and celebration, as well as in times of difficulty and challenge, knowing that the divine is always with us, supporting and guiding us on our path.
Ultimately, cultivating a deep and abiding relationship with the divine through prayer is one of the greatest gifts of the Wayist path. By opening ourselves to this intimate connection, we discover a sense of belonging, purpose, and fulfillment that transcends the limitations of our individual lives. We recognize that we are part of a greater unfolding of love and wisdom, and we dedicate ourselves to serving this higher purpose with all our heart, mind, and soul. We recognize that we are destined to live and work eternally in a majestic spiritual space, holding the company of buddhas, gods, deities, angels, and taras.
## 3.3 The Art of Gratitude and Surrender in Prayer
In Wayist spirituality, the practice of prayer is not only a means of communicating with the divine but also a powerful tool for cultivating the essential qualities of gratitude and surrender. These two attributes lie at the heart of the spiritual path, and their cultivation through prayer can greatly accelerate our growth and transformation.
Gratitude is the recognition and appreciation of the countless blessings and gifts that we receive in each moment of our lives. When we approach prayer with a grateful heart, we shift our focus from what we lack to what we already possess, from our perceived problems to the inherent perfection of the divine order.
The list of things we are to be grateful for comprise tomes of notes. Just the fact that we have a finger to roll a mouse or scroll a document is a major gratitude. Two eyes are a blessing, and a bladder is miracle, and the millions of non-human beings inside us are such a great gift we cannot stop thanking the Universe for it. Without saliva and nails on our toes, and a big toe, and a thumb, life would have been very, very, hard. A lot of people, but not most, have roofs that don't leak and windows they can close. Some people, but not so many, have more than three pairs of shoes and shampoo. Your list in your gratitude journal will be long. These are the things we have and we make the most of it. These are the tools available to us, and we craft a life with it.
By expressing our gratitude to the divine, we open ourselves to a spiritual principle hidden from most people. We step into a profound sense of abundance and sufficiency, recognizing that all our needs are truly met in each moment. We discover the Wayist concept of Udbhu-Kanti which states that authenticity is sufficient beauty and Finding your Enough is an essential spiritual skill. We learn to trust in the benevolence of Karma, knowing that we are forever held in the loving embrace of the divine.
Moreover, the practice of gratitude in prayer helps to dissolve the barriers of the soul-minds, which constantly seek to assert their own will and desires. By genuinely giving thanks for all that we have received, we recognize the limitations of our individual perspective and the vastness of the divine intelligence that underlies all of creation.
Surrender, on the other hand, is the willingness to let go of our attachments and agendas and to align ourselves with the higher purpose, wisdom and love of the divine. When we approach prayer with an attitude of surrender, we release our grip on the illusion of control and open ourselves to the flow of divine grace.
This requires a deep humility and trust, which builds over time as we continue our mystical practise. That trust and humility is a recognition that our individual will and understanding are limited and that there is a greater intelligence at work in the Butterfly Path. By surrendering our fears, doubts, and desires to the divine, we create space for the emergence of our true nature, which is eternally connected to the Divine energies of God our Father and God our Mother in Heaven.
The practice of surrender in prayer is not a passive or fatalistic attitude, but rather an active choice to align ourselves with the highest truth and love. It is a recognition that our deepest fulfillment and purpose lie not in the pursuit of soul interests, but in the spiritual essence and spiritual purposes for which we came to Earth.
As we cultivate the art of gratitude and surrender in prayer, we may find that our relationship with the divine deepens and becomes more intimate and trusting. We learn to approach life with a sense of openness and curiosity, knowing that every experience, no matter how challenging or confusing, is an invitation to grow and evolve.
Moreover, the qualities of gratitude and surrender that we cultivate in prayer naturally begin to infuse our daily lives, transforming our relationships, our work, and our sense of purpose. We become more attuned to the blessings and opportunities that surround us, and more willing to let go of our attachments and fears in service of the highest good.
Ultimately, the art of gratitude and surrender in prayer changes our own energies and we become different persons, we change, and we attract different people, and some will find us less attractive and take their energies elsewhere. It is a powerful means of aligning ourselves with the divine will and opening ourselves to the transformative power of grace. By approaching prayer with these essential qualities, we accelerate our spiritual evolution and become ever more radiant expressions of the divine in the world.

## 4.1 The Purpose and Benefits of Meditation in Wayist Spirituality
In Wayist spirituality, meditation is a foundational practice that serves to align our consciousness with the divine and cultivate a direct experience of our true nature. We practise it as structured meditation sessions, or as an attitude of meditation which we can hold for prolonged times during a normal day's activities. By disciplining the brain-mind and focusing our attention spirit-ward, we create the conditions for profound insight, healing, and transformation to occur.
At its core, the purpose of meditation in Wayism is to awaken us from the delusions of the soul-minds and to connect us with purpose of life, to develop our spirit-self. In the busyness and distractions of daily life, it is all too easy to become lost in the endless stream of thoughts, emotions, and sensations that arise in our experience. We may identify with these passing phenomena, believing them to be the totality of who we are.
Through the practice of meditation, however, we begin to disidentify with the contents of our soul-minds and brain-mind, and to recognize the vast spaciousness of spiritual awareness that underlies all experience. We discover that, at our core, we are not limited to being the typical soul entities that we have taken ourselves to be, but we have the potential to evolve into immortal spiritual beings and become an expression of the infinite and eternal spiritual energies that pervade the spiritual domain, and our heaven.
This recognition is not merely an intellectual understanding but a direct and embodied realization that transforms our entire perception of reality. As we deepen our practice of meditation, we begin to experience a profound sense of unity and interconnectedness with all of life, recognizing that the same Universal Energy that animates our own being also flows through every other creature and phenomenon in the universe. In addition, we gain knowledge and firsthand experiences that confirm spiritual energy as the most refined spectrum within Universal Energy.
The benefits of meditation in Wayist spirituality are numerous and far-reaching. On a practical level, regular meditation has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, improve focus and concentration, and enhance overall physical and emotional well-being. We acquire a state of inner stillness and equanimity, and we become better equipped to navigate the challenges and uncertainties of life with grace and resilience.
On a deeper level, however, the benefits of meditation extend far beyond the realm of personal well-being. Through this practice, we begin to awaken to our true purpose and potential as spiritual beings, recognizing that our ultimate fulfillment lies not in the pursuit of worldly pleasures and achievements, but in the realization of our divine nature and the service of all life.
As we continue to meditate and align ourselves with the divine, we may find that our hearts open in profound ways, allowing us to experience a depth of love, compassion, and understanding that we never knew possible. We become more attuned to the needs and suffering of others, and more willing to use our unique gifts and talents in service of the greater good. We start to appreciate some of the wise elders among us, some of the oldest souls, are not the traditionally educated and materially wealthy, or of the same skin color.
*The Way is difficult and very intricate.*
*Lalla discarded her books that told*
*about it, and through meditation*
*saw the truth that never comes*
*to anyone from reading words.*
*~ Lalleshwari*
Moreover, the practice of meditation can serve as a powerful catalyst for the cultivation of other essential qualities on the spiritual path, such as patience, humility, and surrender. By learning to observe the workings of our own mind with detachment and compassion, we let go gradually of the patterns of resistance and attachment which keep us trapped in cycles of suffering and limitation.
Ultimately, the purpose and benefits of meditation in Wayist spirituality are nothing less than the complete transformation of our being and the alignment of our lives with the highest truth and love. By dedicating ourselves to this practice with sincerity and devotion, we open ourselves to the infinite possibilities of spiritual growth and awakening, and we become ever more radiant expressions of the divine in the world.
## 4.2 Types of Meditation in Wayist Practice
### One can classify the different ways of meditation that become popular over the ages in the following six groups.
### 1. Mindfulness Meditation
This practice involves cultivating a state of present-moment awareness, observing the contents of our experience with detachment and equanimity. By learning to witness our thoughts, emotions, and sensations without judgment or reactivity, we develop greater clarity, insight, and emotional balance. Mindfulness meditation can be practiced in a formal seated position or integrated into daily activities such as walking, eating, or working. When it comes to meditation, Mindfulness is more self-centered than Avalokane.
### 2. Avalokane Meditation
This practice takes it name from the spiritual being named by humans as Lord Avalokitesvara (Skt. *avalokite* (observing from heaven) + *ishvara* (lord). He is the yang-energy deity in charge of the school of divinity for souls, Butterfly Path.
When we practice this meditation we elevate our view to observe from on high, dispassionately, simply observing. What does the world, its affairs, and the energies of all in the ecology look like from a divine perspective?
We concentrate on becoming aware of all the various energies and their interconnectedness. We observe the trees from on high and then down to the surface, then down below the surface. All the animals and leaves, vegetation and their roots, mycelium and underground insects and animals, all form interconnected networks. And we become aware of the energies of people moving through, and the energies of all withing the energy ecology --- of which we are but a part.
Gradually our awareness of the more real view of Earth and society emerges.
We are getting closer to understanding Reality, and our insignificant little place in it all.
### 3. Concentrative Meditation
This practice involves focusing the brain-mind on a single object of attention, such as the breath, a mantra, or a visual image. By training the brain-mind to remain steadily focused, we cultivate a greater ability to allow spirit-minds to connect and remain connected. Concentrative meditation can be especially helpful for those who struggle with a restless or distracted mind, often described as "monkey mind" because it is so easily distracted and busy. It helps to train brain-mind and builds the capacity for sustained and focused spiritual attention.
### 4. Loving-Kindness Meditation
Also known as Chresto'tes Meditation, this practice involves cultivating feelings of love, compassion, and goodwill towards oneself, and then toward others. Our duty, as Lord Jesus taught, is to treat all beings with souls as our neighbors and show them the same care we show ourselves. But first, we must learn to love (crestotes) the Divine, and from that we develop self-love (self-crestotes), and from that develops helpful loving-kindness (crestotes) for others. By silently repeating phrases of well-wishing and visualizing the recipient of our love, we open our hearts and dissolve the barriers of separation and isolation. Loving-kindness meditation can be a powerful tool for healing relationships, overcoming resentment and anger, and cultivating a more compassionate and inclusive worldview. Note the sequence in how we cultivate these spiritual skills:
> *When a teacher of Judaism asked Lord Jesus what is the greatest commandment, he declared, "'Love the Lord your God (our Father and Mother in Heaven) with all your heart (Anahata mind) and with all your soul (three soul-minds) and with all your minds (brain-mind and the spirit-minds you have developed). This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbors as yourself.'"*
> *~*
> **Our neighbors are all living beings with souls
We can only be successful in the final grades on Butterfly Path when we cultivate, actively work on, the following: ***Love for the Divine, Love for self, and Love for neighbors***.
In the Koine Greek which Lord Jesus spoke, he used three different words for love: The love for the Divine is *agape* (unconditional love with your entire being). Love for self is *philautia,* and love for your neighbors is *storge* (friendship, love for family). We are in the process of learning many different kinds of love because we are becoming beings of love and loving-kindness.
### **5. Divine Tarayoga**
Divine Tarayoga is a unique and specialized practice that is deeply rooted in Wayist spirituality. The focus is on the deep spiritual connection we feel with the loving presence and guidance of our Divine Tara. As our spiritual mentor, this celestial being is always there for us, serving as a constant companion on our journey. Every human is connected to a Tara, a celestial being those acts as their personal spiritual protector and guide. Through the practice of visualization, the repetition of mantras, and the expression of heartfelt prayers, we establish a profound and intimate relationship with our Divine Tara, opening ourselves to receive profound wisdom, profound healing, and profound support as we navigate our spiritual path.
Tarayoga practice involves yoking one's spiritual minds to one's Divine Tara, elevating one's spiritual energies to resonate and find harmony with Divine Tara. In the Bhagavad Gita, the foundational story of Yoga, the term yoga is depicted as the act of yoking together (as two oxen are yoked together to pull a cart) or carrying the load together, much like Arjuna's experience under Lord Krishna's guidance in battle. The majority of theWAY community rely on their Divine Tara for guidance and coaching, especially in mystical practise.
Through Divine Tarayoga, we can attune ourselves to the lowest frequency of heavenly energy accessible to humans, guiding us step by step into a realm where mystical connections are intensified. By consciously choosing Divine Tarayoga to approach mystiception offers a logical and practical way of gaining the state of mystiception. Divine Tara's aid extends beyond those who consciously seek resonance with her, reaching even those who unknowingly benefit from her help.
### **6. Karman Active Meditation**
The Wayist tradition is where Karman Active Meditation finds its roots, and this sacred practice holds the potential for profound transformation. As the word *Karman* means work or action, it transforms meditation into a dynamic and participatory experience.
Karman Meditation incorporates a unique form of physical exertion known as dynamisometric exercise. This practice transcends traditional isometric techniques by combining dynamic movement with self-regulated resistance. In dynamisometric exercise, practitioners engage their muscles against an imagined force, allowing for joint mobility and muscle elongation or contraction throughout the movement.
The beauty of this approach lies in its universality. Whether performed by a seasoned athlete or an elderly individual, dynamisometric exercise adapts to each practitioner's capacity. The resistance is entirely self-generated, arising from one's own muscular effort and mental focus. This allows for a deeply personalized workout that can be as gentle or as intense as the individual requires.
For instance, a practitioner might visualize grasping and pulling a weighty object. Though the object exists only in the mind, the body responds as if the resistance were real. Muscles engage, joints articulate, and the cardiovascular system responds, potentially leading to perspiration and fatigue. This mind-body synergy not only provides physical benefits but also cultivates a profound connection between mental intention and physical action, a cornerstone of Karman Meditation practice.
The dynamisometric approach in Karman Meditation offers a safe yet effective means of physical conditioning, accessible to individuals across a broad spectrum of physical abilities. It exemplifies the holistic nature of Wayist practices, unifying mental focus, spiritual intention, and physical engagement in a single, transformative exercise.
#### Sensing Energy
Take it one step further. Move the palms approximately 4 inches (10 cm) apart. Close your eyes and ask your heart chakra (Anahata) to generate a bundle of energy there between your palms. You have an energy sensing chakra in your palm. with a little practise you will sense it. Move your hands slightly, cradling the spiritual energy. Feel its pressure, pushing back against your palms.
You did it! Your spiritual awareness has increased manyfold. That's why you "discovered" Wayism.
Next exercise. Using muscle power to "push against your own strength" very slowly pick up something like a piece of paper or pen from the table and bring it to your chest, then put it back. You decide how much resistance you want to apply. Therefore, depending on your physical training needs you can either simply move your body through the KarmanYoga positions or you can move with any amount of resistance. A 70-year-old lady and a 24-year-old fit man can be in the same Karman Active Meditation class, and each will get a physical workout to the maximum of their ability --- and meditate in the process.
Karman Active Meditation is a holistic system of mindful movements, breathwork, and spiritual attunement that aims to harmonize the body, mind, heart, and soul, while cultivating a direct connection with the Divine.
At its core, Karman Active Meditation is a form of embodied prayer and moving meditation. Through a series of fourteen fluid postures, each imbued with deep symbolic meaning and spiritual significance, practitioners learn to awaken and circulate the subtle energies of the body, purify and balance the chakras, and align themselves with the natural flow of life.
Central to the practice of Karman Active Meditation is the cultivation of mystical awareness and communion with the Divine. As one moves through the fourteen postures, each one a mirror of a specific aspect of the spiritual journey, one cultivates a profound intimacy with one's own being and the greater web of life.
#### In Sum
Regardless of the specific technique used, however, all forms of meditation in Wayist practice share a common goal: to awaken us to our true nature as eternal spiritual beings and to align our lives with the highest wisdom and love of the divine.
By cultivating a regular and dedicated meditation practice, we gradually dissolve the barriers of the body's mind and open ourselves to the infinite possibilities of spiritual growth and transformation. We discover the joy of abiding in the eternal present, connected to the source of all life and radiating the light of divine love and compassion to all beings.
## 4.3 Cultivating an Attitude of Meditation in Daily Life
In Wayist spirituality, as you have noted, the practice of meditation is not limited to formal seated sessions but is meant to be integrated into every aspect of our daily lives. By cultivating a meditative mindset throughout the day, we can maintain a sense of inner peace, clarity, and connection to the divine, even amidst the challenges and distractions of the external world.
> *Connect your spirit-minds with your Divine Tara and let her spiritually walk with you, while your brain-mind and soul-minds go about their normal day. This is living in an Attitude of Meditation.*
The Attitude of Meditation allows for various focal points, such as being mindful of one's surroundings, or the people in close proximity, or developing a heightened spiritual consciousness.
As we expand our consciousness, it's important to be aware that our usual brain-mind consciousness will diminish because of the additional load it carries.
This is not multitasking. It is more like having "two minds" so to speak, a spiritual mind and an organic brain mind, both of which are aware of different realities, both of which create a consciousness.
It sound much more complicated and therefore more difficult than it really is because human language does not have the words to communicate it. Once you experience it you will know. It feels natural, and it is easy to switch on and off.
Mindfulness involves bringing our full attention to the present moment, observing our thoughts, emotions, and sensations with a sense of curiosity and non-judgement. This helps us with self-knowledge and material for self-craft. By learning to be mindful in our daily activities, we can break free from the habitual patterns of the mind and cultivate a greater sense of presence and awareness.
Practically speaking, this might involve bringing mindfulness to simple activities such as eating, walking, making love, parenting, or doing household chores. Instead of rushing through these tasks or getting lost in mental distractions, we can use them as opportunities to practice being fully present and attentive. We might notice with heightened awareness the sensations of the food in our mouth as we eat, the mixing of saliva with the food when we chew in order to infuse it with the necessary amino acids, the feeling of our feet on the ground as we walk, or the texture of the dishes as we wash them.
Another key aspect of cultivating a meditative mindset in daily life is the practice of inner listening. This involves tuning into the subtle guidance and wisdom of our own intuition and inner knowing, as well as the whispers of the divine that are always available to us. By learning to quiet the chatter of the mind and create space for inner stillness, we can access a deeper source of guidance and inspiration that can inform our choices and actions in the world.
One way to cultivate inner listening is through the practice of contemplation or self-inquiry. This might involve taking a few moments throughout the day to pause and reflect on our thoughts, feelings, and motivations, asking ourselves questions such as "What is truly important to me?" or "How can I respond to this situation with greater self-love and compassion?", "Why did that upset me?". By engaging in this kind of self-reflection, we can gain greater clarity and insight into our own minds and hearts, and align ourselves more fully with our deepest values and aspirations.
In our quest to cultivate a meditative mindset, it is important to remember that it also involves infusing a sense of reverence and devotion into all aspects of our daily lives, in addition to practicing mindfulness and inner listening. This means approaching each moment and each encounter with reverence and gratitude, acknowledging the divine essence that permeates all existence and immersing ourselves in the present while pursuing the true purpose of life - the spiritual growth of our eternal soul. Whether we are engaging in work, relationships, or creative pursuits, we can infuse our actions with a sense of love, service, and dedication to the highest good.
Ultimately, cultivating a meditative mindset in daily life is about living in alignment with our true nature as spiritual beings, connected to the source of all life and in service to the greater whole, living purposefully and meaningfully, dedicated to the evolution of our soul-self. By bringing the qualities of mindfulness, inner listening, and reverence into our daily activities, we can transform even the most mundane moments into opportunities for spiritual growth and awakening.
Of course, cultivating a meditative mindset in daily life is not always easy, and it requires a certain level of discipline, commitment, and patience. We may find ourselves getting caught up in old patterns of thought and behavior, or struggling to maintain a sense of presence and awareness amidst the demands of daily life.
However, by approaching this practice with a sense of gentleness and self-compassion, and by returning again and again to the simple act of being present, we can gradually deepen our capacity for inner peace and clarity, and infuse our lives with a greater sense of meaning and purpose.
## 4.4 The Convergence of Prayer and Meditation
In Wayist spirituality, the practices of prayer and meditation are intimately interconnected and often converge in powerful ways. While each practice has its own unique qualities and benefits, they both serve as means of aligning our consciousness with the divine and cultivating a direct experience of our true nature.
At their core, both prayer and meditation involve a turning inward, a shift of attention from the external world to the inner spiritual landscape of our own being. In prayer, this turning inward takes the form of a heartfelt communication with the divine, an expression of our deepest longings, joys, and sorrows. In meditation, the turning inward involves a stilling of the mind and a resting in the silent space of pure awareness that underlies all thought and experience.
Yet despite these differences in approach, prayer and meditation ultimately lead us to the same place: a direct and intimate encounter with the divine presence that dwells within us and connects to heaven. As we engage in these practices with sincerity and devotion, we begin to dissolve the barriers of the soul-minds and egoic brain-mind, and open ourselves to the infinite love, wisdom, and compassion that is our true nature.
In Wayist practice, the convergence of prayer and meditation often takes the form of contemplative or devotional meditation. This type of meditation involves focusing the mind on a sacred word, phrase, or image, and allowing the heart to open in a spirit of reverence and surrender. Through this practice, we cultivate a deep and abiding sense of connection to the divine, and allow ourselves to be guided and transformed by its loving presence.
For example, in the practice of Divine Tarayoga, we focus our attention on the image or presence of our celestial guide, and offer our hearts in a spirit of devotion and trust. Through this practice, we open ourselves to receive the blessings and guidance of our Divine Tara, and allow ourselves to be transformed by its infinite love and wisdom.
Similarly, in the practice of mantra meditation, we focus our attention on a sacred word, sound, or phrase, such as "Om Mani Padme Hum" or "Om Namah Shivaya" or "Om Shanti Shanti Om", and allow the vibration of the sound to penetrate our being and align us with the divine. Through this practice, we cultivate a sense of inner peace, clarity, and unity with all of life.
The convergence of prayer and meditation in Wayist practice is a powerful means of integrating the heart and mind, and aligning our entire being with the highest truth and love. By engaging in these practices with regularity and devotion, we gradually dissolve the barriers of separation and awaken to the infinite potential of our future pure spiritual nature.
> *Spiritual beings are inherently, by nature, good and benevolent, and possess great spiritual powers. Goodness is essential to their nature, and a truly spiritual being would not conceive of harming others. Rather than using force, such beings would address wrongdoing by incapacitating or restraining offenders, or sending them elsewhere.*
As we deepen our practice of contemplative and devotional meditation, we may find that our experience of prayer also begins to shift and deepen. Rather than simply reciting words or formulas, we find ourselves engaging in a more spontaneous and intimate form of communication with the divine, one that arises naturally from the depths of our being.
We may find ourselves experiencing prayer as a kind of inner dialogue, a heart-to-heart conversation with the divine presence that comes down to dwell within us when we connect. We may find ourselves offering our fears, doubts, and struggles to this presence, and receiving in return a profound sense of comfort, guidance, and support.
At the same time, we may also find that our experience of meditation begins to take on a more prayerful quality, infused with a sense of reverence, gratitude, and surrender. Rather than simply observing the contents of our mind with detachment, we find ourselves opening our hearts to the spiritual wisdoms that can be had from all experiences, and allowing ourselves to be guided and transformed by its infinite love and wisdom.
In this way, the convergence of prayer and meditation in Wayist practice becomes a kind of sacred alchemy, a transformative process that gradually refines our being and aligns us with the highest truth and love. By engaging in these practices with sincerity, devotion, and an open heart, we create the conditions for profound healing, insight, and awakening to occur.
Of course, the path of prayer and meditation is not always easy, and we may encounter many obstacles and challenges along the way. We may struggle with restlessness, doubt, boring, or feelings of inadequacy, or find ourselves getting caught up in the distractions and demands of daily life.
However, by approaching these challenges with patience, self-compassion, and a spirit of surrender, we can gradually deepen our capacity for inner stillness and alignment with the divine. We can learn to trust in the unfolding of our own unique journey, knowing that every experience, no matter how difficult or confusing, is an invitation to grow and awaken to our true potential.
The convergence of prayer and meditation in Wayist practice is a powerful means of aligning ourselves with the purpose of human life and the deep meaningfulness of everything towards fulfilling the divine purpose, which is our birthright. By dedicating ourselves to these practices with sincerity and devotion, we open ourselves to the infinite possibilities of spiritual growth and transformation, and become ever more radiant expressions of the divine in the world.
This requires a profound shift in our orientation, from the egoic brain-mind and soul-minds, which seeks to control and dominate, to the heart, which knows the value of surrender and receptivity. By learning to let go of our limited ideas of what we think we need or want, and instead aligning ourselves with the greater unfolding of divine will, we discover a deeper sense of peace, trust, and fulfillment.
As we deepen our relationship with the divine through prayer, we may also find that we receive guidance, insight, and support in response to our sincere inquiries and requests. This may come in the form of intuitive nudges, synchronistic events, or even direct messages from our spiritual guides and mentors.
By cultivating an attitude of openness and attentiveness in prayer, we learn to recognize and interpret these signs and messages, allowing them to guide and inform our choices and actions in the world. We develop a sense of partnership and collaboration with the divine, knowing that we are never alone on our spiritual journey.
Over time, as we continue to nurture our relationship with the divine through prayer, we may find that this connection becomes an ever-present source of strength, comfort, and inspiration in our lives. We learn to turn to prayer in moments of joy and celebration, as well as in times of difficulty and challenge, knowing that the divine is always with us, supporting and guiding us on our path.
Ultimately, cultivating a deep and abiding relationship with the divine through prayer is one of the greatest gifts of the Wayist path. By opening ourselves to this intimate connection, we discover a sense of belonging, purpose, and fulfillment that transcends the limitations of our individual lives. We recognize that we are part of a greater unfolding of love and wisdom, and we dedicate ourselves to serving this higher purpose with all our heart, minds, soul, and spirit.
## 4.5 The Art of Gratitude and Surrender in Prayer
In Wayist spirituality, the practice of prayer is not only a means of communicating with the divine but also a powerful tool for cultivating the essential qualities of gratitude and surrender to Divine embrace. These two attributes lie at the heart of the spiritual path, and their cultivation through prayer can greatly accelerate our growth and transformation.
Gratitude is the recognition and appreciation of the countless blessings and gifts that we receive in each moment of our lives. When we approach prayer with a grateful heart, we shift our focus from what we lack to what we already possess, from our perceived problems to the inherent perfection of the divine order.
By being aware of all that we should be grateful for, a spiritual paradigm opens up to us that we never knew to have existed before. New energies, new powers and insights become accessible to us. Divine beings live constantly in a state of gratitude, and therefore never need anything and have no unfulfilled desires. We are evolving into that state.
By expressing our gratitude to the divine, we open ourselves to a profound sense of abundance and sufficiency. We learn to trust in the benevolence of the universe, knowing that we are forever held in the loving embrace of the divine.
Moreover, the practice of gratitude in prayer helps to dissolve the barriers of the egoic minds, which constantly seek to assert its own will and desires. By genuinely giving thanks for all that we have received, we recognize the limitations of our individual perspective and the vastness of the divine intelligence that underlies all on Butterfly Path.
Surrender, on the other hand, is the willingness to let go of our attachments and agendas and to align ourselves with the higher wisdom and love of the divine. When we approach prayer with an attitude of surrender, we release our grip on the illusion of control and open ourselves to the flow of divine grace.
Once you fully realize the reality that you are always one breath away from a viral infection, one heartbeat away from a debilitating stroke, one stupid accident away from an atrocity that can remove all of your assets and your ability to walk or take care of yourself --- then you are approaching the gift of gratitude and all the security and blessings it brings. Once you realize how your life will change when even a single of the multitude of species of biome living in your gut are destroyed, or when the toxin load on your cereal, fruits and veggies finally catches up to your liver and colon, you bend a knee in gratitude. When you realize how your life changes when you lose a big toe or a thumb, or when Karma decides to bring along lessons to help you get over your sense of individuality and your arrogance and sense of entitlement, you drop down to your knees in surrender. And your life changes for the better, no matter what happens.
This requires a deep humility and trust, a recognition that our individual will and understanding are limited and that there is a greater intelligence at work in the universe. By surrendering our fears, doubts, and desires to the divine, we create space for the emergence of our true nature, which is directly connected to the source of Butterfly Path, which is managed from our Heaven.
The practice of surrender in prayer is not a passive or fatalistic attitude, but rather an active choice to align ourselves with the highest truth and love. It is a recognition that our deepest fulfillment and purpose lie not in the pursuit of our own narrow interests, but in the purpose and meaning of life.
As we cultivate the art of gratitude and surrender in prayer, we may find that our relationship with the divine deepens and becomes more intimate and trusting. We learn to approach life with a sense of openness and curiosity, knowing that every experience, no matter how challenging or confusing, is an invitation to grow and evolve.
Moreover, the qualities of gratitude and surrender that we cultivate in prayer naturally begin to infuse our daily lives, transforming our relationships, our work, and our sense of purpose. We become more attuned to the blessings and opportunities that surround us, and more willing to let go of our attachments and fears in service of the highest good, our spiritual evolution.
Ultimately, the art of gratitude and surrender in prayer is a powerful means of aligning ourselves with the divine will and opening ourselves to the transformative power of grace. By approaching prayer with these essential qualities, we accelerate our spiritual evolution and become ever more radiant expressions of the divine in the world.

Chapter 5
## Karman Active Meditation
### Body, Soul, Mind, and Spirit Maintenance
### The Origins and Significance of Karman Active Meditation
Karman Active Meditation is a sacred and transformative practice that originated in the Wayist tradition of spirituality. It is a holistic system of mindful movements, breathwork, and spiritual attunement known to be a holistic "body, mind, spirit, and soul maintenance program".
Karman Active Meditation traces its roots back to Bodhidharma, a Wayist teacher from the 6th century. He journeyed from India to China to teach our customs and gained considerable fame (or notoriety) in China and Korea. Bodhidharma once observed that monks in monasteries were weak and unhealthy due to lack of exercise and being pampered by their followers. He instructed them in the practice of Karman Active Meditation. In addition to officially adopting it, the Chinese monks went above and beyond to transform it into the martial art we now know as KungFu.
This holistic practice serves as a catalyst for awakening our innate capacity for healing, self-realization and communion with the Divine. By consciously working with the vital life force energy of prana, Karman Yoga Meditation clears and balances the chakras, enhances the radiance of the aura, and unblocks the flow of the meridians. As we engage in this moving meditation, we not only strengthen and purify the physical body, but also cultivate mental clarity, emotional equilibrium, and spiritual attunement.
The 14 core movements of Karman Active Meditation are inclusive and suitable for everyone, regardless of age, fitness level, or spiritual background. Regardless of their physical limitations or preferences, each participant in the class can partake in as much physical exercise as they desire using the identical movements. The ability to do this movement is attributed to the fact that we push against our own muscle resistance, creating a sensation similar to being immersed in oil. With the aim of fostering a deep connection to the divine, each movement is carefully infused with symbolic meaning, while being complemented by a specific mantra and mudra. Together, these aspects help to center the mind in a state of sacred intention. Through regular, dedicated practice, these movements become a pathway to embodied prayer and a means of aligning our individual will with the greater will of the Divine.
The term "Karman" itself comes from the Sanskrit word meaning "action" or "work," reflecting the active and engaged nature of this meditation practice.
At its core, Karman Active Meditation is a form of embodied prayer and moving meditation. Through a series of fourteen graceful and fluid postures, each imbued with deep symbolic meaning and spiritual significance, practitioners learn to awaken and circulate the subtle energies of the body, purify and reset the energies of the chakras, and align themselves with the natural flow of life.
The significance of Karman Active Meditation lies in its ability to bridge the gap between the physical and spiritual dimensions of our being, and to cultivate a direct and intimate connection with the Divine. By engaging the body, mind, heart, and soul in a unified practice of mindful movement and spiritual attunement, we open ourselves to the transformative and energizing power of divine grace, love, and wisdom.
One of the fundamental principles of Karman Active Meditation is the understanding that our physical bodies are not separate entities from our soul and spiritual essence, but rather an integral and interconnected part of our entire being. This holistic perspective acknowledges that when a soul-mind energy becomes debilitated, it can eventually impact the body-mind, and if left unchecked and unaddressed, the imbalance may spread to other soul-minds and even manifest as physical ailments in the body. This recognition emphasizes the importance of maintaining harmony and balance across all aspects of our existence --- spiritual, mental, and physical.
By cultivating awareness and bringing conscious intention to our movements and actions, we can begin to dissolve the perceived barriers between the physical and spiritual realms. This practice allows us to experience a profound sense of unity and wholeness, recognizing that our spiritual well-being is intimately tied to our physical health, and vice versa. Karman Active Meditation encourages individuals to engage in mindful movement as a means of facilitating this integration, promoting healing, and fostering a deeper connection between the body, mind, and soul.
Ultimately, by acknowledging the interdependence of our physical and spiritual aspects, we can work towards creating greater harmony within ourselves and experience the transformative benefits of a truly holistic approach to well-being.
Another important aspect of Karman Active Meditation is the cultivation of mystical awareness and communion with the Divine. Through the use of mantras, visualizations, and subtle energy work, practitioners learn to attune themselves to the whispers of their own soul and the guidance and energizing of divine energies.
In the Wayist tradition, this mystical connection is understood as a direct experience of the Divine presence that dwells within and all around us --- the infinite source of love, wisdom, and creativity that animates our existence. By surrendering to this sacred presence and allowing it to guide and inspire our practice, we open ourselves to profound states of healing, insight, and transformation.
As we move through the postures of Karman Active Meditation with mindfulness and devotion, we may experience a range of mystical phenomena --- from subtle sensations of heat, energy tingling, energized vibration in the body, to expansive feelings of joy, peace, and connection, to profound visions, intuitions, and revelations. These experiences are not seen as ends in themselves, but as signposts and confirmations of our deepening alignment with the Divine.
## 5.1 The Sanctifying Movements of Karman Active Meditation
##
The practice of Karman Active Meditation revolves around a series of fourteen sacred movements, each imbued with deep symbolic meaning and spiritual significance.

The practice of Karman Active Meditation can help to regulate and harmonize our emotional energies, reducing stress, anxiety, and negative thought patterns. As we rid ourselves of negative energies and emotions, we are restored to our natural state. As we cultivate a sense of inner peace and equanimity, we may find that we are better able to navigate the ups and downs of life with greater ease and grace.
#### 3. Mental clarity
The focused attention and spiritual attunement of Karman Active Meditation can help to quiet the chatter of the mind and cultivate a state of inner stillness and clarity. As we learn to observe our thoughts and emotions with greater detachment and wisdom, we may experience heightened levels of self-awareness and self-craft. We also train brain-mind to focus, be mindful of every muscle, the blood flow, the energizing of cells, and the flow of metaphysical energies in various parts of our holistic self. This trains the brain-mind to acknowledge and embrace the metaphysical component of our entire self.
#### 4. Spiritual awakening
The ultimate goal of Karman Active Meditation is to awaken us to our true nature becoming immortal spiritual beings, and to cultivate a direct and intimate connection with the Divine. As we surrender to the flow of prana and divine energies within us, we may experience a renewal of the self and empowerment to face the day ahead with peacefulness, authenticity and assured stability.
#### 5. Increased self-awareness
Through the practice of Karman Active Meditation, we cultivate a deeper sense of self-awareness and self-understanding. As we learn to observe our patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior with greater clarity and compassion, we may gain valuable insights into our own growth and healing, and develop a greater capacity for self-reflection and self-transformation.
#### 6. Enhanced relationships
The practice of Karman Active Meditation can help to deepen and enrich our relationships with others. It is frequently seen as a group activity, for which it ideally suited because people of all abilities can participate. As we cultivate greater empathy, compassion, and understanding. As we learn to see the Divine in all beings and to approach each interaction with an open heart and mind, we may experience greater harmony, connection, and love in all of our relationships.
#### 7. Energy Hygiene and Protection
During the Karman Active Meditation session we also practice daily clearing out of "unwanted" or "stale" energy, as if we are doing energy ablutions. We cultivate and practice creating energy shields to filter out the negative energies from our environment and to clean the energies we allow in.
Ultimately, the transformative effects of Karman Active Meditation are not limited to any particular aspect of our being, but extend to every facet of our complex selves. As we cultivate a direct and intimate connection with the Divine through this sacred practice, we open ourselves to the infinite possibilities of growth, healing, and awakening that dwell within us.
By incorporating Karman Active Meditation in your lifestyle you are taking care of your mind, body, soul-minds, and spirit-minds, as well as nurturing your relationship with your Divine Guide. You empower yourself with the very best of energies to face every day as your authentic self with pure energies and an energy filter and shield for protecting your power and wholesomeness.

## Mystiception
### Experiencing Divine Connections
### Understanding Mystiception and Its Significance in Wayist Spirituality
In Wayist spirituality, Mystiception (mystical + perception) refers to the state of direct experience of divine connection and spiritual awareness that transcends ordinary consciousness. It is a state of heightened perception and intuition, in which we access profound levels of insight, guidance, and healing.
At its core, Mystiception is a way of knowing that goes beyond the limitations of the rational mind and the physical senses. It is a form of direct, intuitive understanding that arises from the depths of our being and connects us to the infinite wisdom and love of the divine.
Mystiception transcends any form of consciousness. Consciousness is a product of the brain and its brain-mind. Mystiception is intelligent awareness in the higher-self, in the spirit-minds of Vishuddhi, Ajna and Sahasrara.
In Wayist practice, Mystiception is seen as a natural and essential part of the spiritual journey, a way of aligning ourselves with the highest truth and accessing the guidance and support of the divine realm. By cultivating a state of openness and receptivity to divine connection, we can enter into a profound source of inner knowing and transformation.
One of the key aspects of Mystiception in Wayist spirituality is the understanding that it is not limited to any particular time, place, or form. While certain practices such as meditation, prayer, or contemplation may help to induce states of Mystiception, the experience itself is not confined to these practices.
Rather, Mystiception can arise spontaneously in the midst of daily life, often in response to a heightened state of awareness or a sincere desire for divine connection. It may come in the form of a sudden insight or realization, a feeling of profound peace or joy, or a sense of unity with all of life. It can come when you suddenly sense a strong soul-energy presence or a spiritual-energy presence.
Another important aspect of Mystiception in Wayist spirituality is the recognition that it is not a passive or receptive state, but rather an active and co-creative process. When we open ourselves to divine connection, we are not simply receiving information or guidance from an external source, but rather participating in a dynamic exchange of energy and consciousness.
In this way, Mystiception becomes a means of aligning ourselves with the divine will and accessing our own inner wisdom and creativity. By learning to trust in the guidance and support of the divine realm, we can become more effective agents of change and transformation in the world.
Of course, the path of Mystiception is not always easy, and it requires a certain level of dedication, discipline, and discernment. We may encounter many obstacles and challenges along the way, from the distractions and limitations of the soul's egoic minds and the brain mind to the fear and resistance which can arise in the face of profound spiritual awakening and how we change in the process.
However, by approaching these challenges with patience, self-compassion, and a spirit of surrender, we can gradually deepen our capacity for Mystiception and align ourselves more fully with the divine will. We can learn to navigate the inner landscape of our own being with greater clarity and confidence, and access the guidance and support that is always available to us.
Ultimately, the significance of Mystiception in Wayist spirituality lies in its potential to transform our lives and our world in profound ways. By opening ourselves to divine connection and aligning ourselves with the highest truth and love, we become more effective agents of healing, compassion, and positive change.
We learn to see the divine Universal Energy in all things, and to approach each moment and each encounter with a sense of reverence and purpose. We become more attuned to the needs and vibrant, often joyful and wise personalities of all soul beings, plant, insect, and all other, and are more willing to use our unique gifts and talents in service of the greater purpose of life --- to experience all different aspects of being human, at all levels of energy.
In this way, the practice of Mystiception becomes a powerful means of fulfilling our highest potential as spiritual beings, and of contributing to the evolution and awakening of the soul. By dedicating ourselves to this path with sincerity, humility, and an open heart, we can become ever more radiant expressions of the divine love and wisdom that is becoming our immortal nature.
## 6.1 The Mysticeptive Capacity and Mysticeptive States
In Wayist spirituality, the Mysticeptive capacity refers to an individual's innate potential for experiencing and cultivating states of Mystiception, or direct spiritual perception and awareness of communion and discourse with divine beings in the spiritual realm. This capacity is seen as a natural and essential aspect of our spiritual nature, a way of accessing the profound wisdom, guidance, and healing that is available to us through divine connection.
The Mysticeptive capacity is not something that is limited to a select few individuals or reserved for those with special abilities or training. Rather, it is a universal human potential of the spirit-minds, that can be developed, cultivated, and controlled through regular spiritual practice and self-reflection.
Mystiception doesn't refer to our ability to perceive the soul energy of others. Every soul-mind, regardless of being animal or plant, can sense soul energies. All souls have the natural capacity to perceive the energies of other souls, even those without an organic body. This is energy perception is different to Mystiception, which is direct spiritual perception and awareness of communion and discourse with divine beings in the spiritual realm.
In Wayist practice, the development of the Mysticeptive capacity is seen as a spiritual skill, a gradual and ongoing process, one that unfolds over the course of a lifetime and beyond.
As we engage in practices such as meditation, prayer, and contemplation, we gradually attune ourselves to the subtle energies and dimensions of our own being and open ourselves to the guidance and support of the divine realm.
Our Mysticeptive capacity deepens and expands. We may begin to experience what are known as Mysticeptive states --- heightened states of spiritual awareness in which we access profound levels of spiritual cognizance, clarity, and connection.
These states can take many forms, depending on the individual and the context in which they arise.
#### **Some common characteristics of Mysticeptive states include:**
-   A profound sense of inner peace and stillness, often accompanied by feelings of joy, bliss, or ecstasy.
-   A heightened awareness of the energetic interconnectedness of all life, and a sense of unity with the divine presence that underlies all spiritual existence.
-   A deep sense of meaning and purpose, and a clear understanding of one's role, duty, and mission in the world.
-   Access to profound levels of intuitive wisdom and guidance, often in the form of insights, visions, profound wisdom, or inner knowings.
-   A heightened capacity for empathy and chrestotes, and a deep sense of connection to the suffering and struggles of others.
-   A sense of being guided and supported by spiritual beings. People from different cultures use different names for the same entities, like Divine Tara, saints, angels, spirit guides, gods, God, or buddhas.
Because we make ourselves receptive to energy inflows and allow for personal transformation, it is important to approach the mysticeptive state with discernment and humility. For the Wayist, this is a primary reason for developing a deep relationship with one's Tara, and get to recognise their unique energy and character.
Not all instances of heightened metaphysical energy awareness are spiritual-energy connections or awareness of spirit-beings. Sometimes people experience soul-energy connections instead. It is important to be aware that inexperienced practitioners can mistake soul-energy for spirit-energy.
This distinction is crucial because it can mislead people into thinking they are connecting with a spiritual deity when they are actually experiencing a soul-energy connection. Soul-energy connections are most prevalent among individuals involved in soul-religions, where deities are often referred to as "holy spirits" but are actually described as beings with desires and qualities similar to soul-people, just with greater power.
Seasoned practitioners learn to discern the difference between soul-energy and spirit-energy connections. This ability to differentiate is an important skill in Wayist spiritual practice, as it ensures authentic spiritual experiences and prevents misunderstandings about the nature of divine beings.
It is essential to cultivate inner discernment and harmonize with spiritual beings who are inherently good. Spiritual beings are free from tribalism, speciesism, bigotry, genocidal notions, intimidation, and the need to inflict hardship or pain.
In Wayist practice, the cultivation of Mysticeptive states is seen not as an end in itself, but rather as a means of aligning ourselves more fully with the divine will to access the guidance and support that we need to fulfill our highest purpose in the world.
By approaching these states with a sense of reverence, openness, and surrender, we can gradually deepen our capacity for divine connections and become more effective agents of healing and transformation in the world.
Ultimately, the development of the Mysticeptive capacity and the cultivation of Mysticeptive states is a lifelong journey of growth, discovery, and alignment with the highest truth and love. By dedicating ourselves to this path with sincerity, humility, and an open heart, we can access the profound wisdom, guidance, and healing that is available to us through divine connection, and become ever more radiant expressions of the divine love and wisdom that is our true nature.
## 6.2 Navigating the Mysticeptive Gateway
The Mysticeptive Gateway is the metaphorical gates of heaven described in almost every spirituality and religion. The Mysticeptive Gateway refers to the threshold between lower energies of soul and brain-consciousness, and the metaphysical realm of profound spiritual experience. Crossing this threshold allows for deep states of Mystiception and communion with the divine.
According to Wayist Teacher , entering requires mastering the "opening and closing of the gates of heaven." Teacher Laotzi refers to the initial stage of spiritual connections when spirit-minds begin to resonate with spiritual energy. Lord Jesus said, "I am the gate of heaven. Whoever comes through me will soar and find peace in heaven." Lord Jesus indicates that a connection with a spiritual being of our heaven is necessary to navigate metaphorical gates.
The Mysticeptive Gateway is not a physical place or a specific technique, but rather a state of consciousness that arises when an individual's spirit-minds (Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara) approach resonance with the lower divine energies. This state is attained when there is a harmonious alignment between the individual's spiritual energies and the frequencies of the divine realm.
Navigating the Mysticeptive Gateway is a profound and transformative experience that requires a certain level of spiritual maturity, openness, and surrender. It is not something that can be forced or controlled by the brain-mind, but rather a natural unfolding that occurs as a result of sincere spiritual practice and alignment with the divine will. Some drugs are purported to bring one to the Mysticeptive Gateway, where time stands still and the Divine energies flow. But only spiritual maturity and skill will allow us to enter.
As an individual approaches the Mysticeptive Gateway, they may experience a range of deep encounters and phenomena, such as:
-   A feeling of being in the presence of the divine, often accompanied by a profound sense of love, awe, and reverence.
-   A very brief influx of intuitive insights, visions, or inner knowings.
-   A sense of unity and interconnectedness with all of existence, and a dissolving of the barriers between self and other.
-   A heightened awareness of the subtle energies and dimensions of reality, and an increased sensitivity to the needs and struggles of others.
Navigating the Mysticeptive Gateway can be both exhilarating and challenging, as it often requires a letting go of the familiar structures and patterns of the ego-minds. It is a process of surrendering to the divine will and allowing oneself to be guided and transformed by the infinite love and wisdom of the divine realm.
In Wayist practice, the skills of the Vishuddhi spirit-mind are particularly important for navigating the Mysticeptive Gateway. This spirit-mind, associated with the throat chakra, is responsible for making the initial connections and accessing the lower levels of divine energies.
As an individual cultivates their Vishuddhi spirit-mind through practice, desire for union from Anahata, and spiritual communication with Divine Tara, they become more adept at attuning themselves to the frequencies of the divine realm and navigating the Mysticeptive Gateway with greater ease and grace.
In Wayist spirituality, passing through the Mysticeptive Gateway is seen not as a destination or an achievement, but rather as a continual process of opening and surrendering to the divine will. It is a lifelong journey of growth, discovery, and alignment with the infinite love and wisdom of the divine realm.
By dedicating ourselves to this path with sincerity, humility, and an open heart, we can gradually deepen our capacity for navigating the Mysticeptive Gateway and accessing the profound guidance, healing, and transformation that is available to us through divine connection. As Teacher Laotzi said, "When the gates of heaven open and close, can you remain steadfast?" Can you regroup and try again? Can you learn to keep the gates open for yourself?
These experiences may last but one second in the beginning, but the significance is immense and the impact on your life is lasting. As we progress, we spend more and more time in the mysticeptive state.
When the Mysticeptive gateway closes, the individual may feel a sense of separation from the divine and a return to ordinary consciousness. This can be a challenging transition, as the individual must integrate the insights and transformative effects of the mystical experience into their daily life. However, with practice and dedication, the individual can learn to sustain a more consistent connection with the divine, even in the midst of the demands and distractions of the material world.
Ultimately, the Mysticeptive Gateway is a powerful symbol of the potential for spiritual awakening and enlightenment that lies within each of us. By cultivating a strong foundation of spiritual practice, self-reflection, and alignment with the highest truth and love, we can navigate this threshold with greater ease and grace, and become ever more radiant expressions of the divine love and wisdom that is our true nature.
## 6.3 Mysticeptual Insights and Their Role in Spiritual Growth
In Wayist spirituality, Mysticeptual insights refer to the profound wisdom, guidance, and understanding that arise from states of Mystiception, or direct spiritual perception and awareness.
These insights are not merely intellectual or conceptual in nature, but rather a form of intuitive knowing that emerges from the depths of our being and connects us to the infinite wisdom of the divine realm.
Mysticeptual insights can take many different forms, depending on the individual and the context in which they arise.
#### Some common characteristics of Mysticeptual insights include:
-   A clear and direct understanding of the nature of reality, often accompanied by a profound sense of unity and interconnectedness with all of existence.
-   A deep sense of meaning and purpose, and a clear understanding of one's role and mission in the world.
-   A heightened awareness of the subtle energies and dimensions of reality, and an increased sensitivity to the needs and struggles of others.
-   Access to profound levels of intuitive wisdom and guidance, often in the form of revelations of wisdoms and inner knowings (as if it is old knowledge that came to mind again) of the nature of reality, visions, or direct messages from the divine realm.
-   A sense of being guided and supported by higher forces or beings, such as angels, spirit guides, or divine entities (all of whom are, in fact, our personal Tara).
-   We sense that everything we once knew is now irrelevant and replaced by a new "sense of knowing" in the spirit. Realizing we knew very little despite thinking we knew a lot. Along with that comes the feeling of letting go of unnecessary knowledge and gaining a deep understanding that reveals how little we truly know. The nature of "knowledge" and "truth" becomes apparent: they are unpredictable and perpetually shifting. In our wisdom, the soul and brain-minds become notably arrogant about their cleverness, which ultimately amounts to nothing.
Mysticeptual insights play a crucial role in the process of spiritual growth and transformation. They serve as a form of divine guidance and support, helping us to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the spiritual path with greater clarity, confidence, and alignment with the highest truth and love.
On a practical level, Mysticeptual insights can provide us with valuable guidance and direction in our daily lives, helping us to make important decisions, overcome obstacles, and fulfill our highest purpose in the world. They can also serve as a source of comfort and reassurance, reminding us of the infinite love and support that is always available to us through divine connection.
On a deeper level, Mysticeptual insights serve as a catalyst for profound spiritual transformation and awakening. They help us to break free from the limitations and illusions of the ego-minds, and to align ourselves more fully with the infinite wisdom and love of the divine realm.
As we cultivate a greater capacity for Mysticeptual insights through regular spiritual practice and self-reflection, we begin to experience a profound shift in our consciousness and perception of reality. We become more attuned to the subtle energies and dimensions of our own being and that of the world around us, and more receptive to the guidance and support of the divine realm.
In Wayist practice, the cultivation of Mysticeptual insights is seen not as an end in itself, but rather as a means of aligning ourselves more fully with the divine will and accessing the guidance and support that we need to fulfill our highest purpose in the world.
By approaching these insights with a sense of reverence, openness, and surrender, we can gradually deepen our capacity for divine connection and become more effective agents of healing and transformation in the world.
It is important to approach Mysticeptual insights with discernment and humility, recognizing that not all experiences of heightened awareness or spiritual connection are necessarily authentic or beneficial. It is essential to cultivate a strong foundation of relationship with our Tara, by any name, and spiritual practice, self-reflection, and alignment with the purposes of Butterfly Path before attempting to interpret or act upon these insights.
Ultimately, the cultivation of Mysticeptual insights is a lifelong journey of growth, discovery, and alignment with the highest truth and love. By dedicating ourselves to this path with sincerity, humility, and an open heart, we can access the profound wisdom, guidance, and healing that is available to us through divine connection, and become ever more radiant expressions of the divine love and wisdom that is our true nature.

## Mysticeptive Experiences in Wayist Practice
### Mystical Perception
### Common Phenomena in Mystiception
Mystiception, the heightened spiritual awareness and perception experienced during mystical connections with divine energies, manifests in various ways within the spirit-minds of Wayist practitioners. The following section explores the diverse range of experiences that can occur during mystiception, offering insights into the transformative impact of these profound spiritual encounters.
#### 1. Brain-Consciousness Modification
Higher levels of mystiception create modified states of brain-consciousness, as if the brain's normal consciousness is temporarily downscaled or throttled and it allows awareness of spirit-mind activities. An untrained brain may perceive this unfamiliar scenario as a threat and attempt to interfere with the mysticeptive state by demanding a return to its normal consciousness and environmental awareness. However, with practice, Wayists learn to manage and ignore these demands from the brain-mind, allowing for prolonged and deeper mysticeptive experiences. Training methods, such as meditating in cold temperatures or busy, noisy environments, can help develop the skill to manage brain-mind consciousness for the purposes of mystiception.
#### 2. Aethereal Flow and Wholesome Energies
Mystiception almost always generates an experience of one's aethereal self "flowing" in divine energy, with divine energy flowing through the entire being, flooding the practitioner with repairing energies and wholesomeness. This profound sense of connection and rejuvenation is a hallmark of the mysticeptive state.
#### 3. Euphoria and Ecstasy
Mystiception frequently results in experiences of euphoria, leaving the practitioner in a state of ecstasy characterized by an immense flood of gratitude, humbleness, and wholesomeness. A remarkable sense of Goodness lingers, sometimes for days, accompanied by a deeper sense of bonding with one's Divine Tara.
#### 4. Mysticeptive Vision and Lucid Dreaming
Mysticeptive vision sometimes manifests as what researchers term "lucid dreaming," where the brain-consciousness interprets a set of metaphysical visuals to extract meaning. These experiences, which directly involve brain-consciousness, are often called "visions" by researchers. The brain holds pictures in mind, without the organic eyes having seen them. Individuals then derive meaning and wisdom for self-reflection and self-crafting by interpreting these visions. Some researchers think this is the foundation of certain types of dreams which occur while the brain's consciousness is sleeping.
#### 5. Out-of-Body and Near-Death Experiences
Mystiception can sometimes result in experiences described as out-of-body or near-death. The hybrid soul-spirit recognizes these as similar to the departure from the organic body at death, when the soul-spirit essence travels to Paradise for processing and awaiting reincarnation. During these experiences, the practitioner may feel their soul or spirit essence partially outside the organic body, as if floating above it or in another dimension, while remaining aware of the body's location. This "distance" is likely not a physical measurement but rather a separation in terms of energy types or energy domains.
During meditation or prayer, individuals may encounter what is often classified as a near death experience. In this particular scenario, the hybrid soul-spirit of the person enters the Psychomesion, a realm that will be further explained later on. It is in this state that they are able to witness the luminous glow of Paradise in the distance. This is also a place where your Divine Tara will sometimes take you to learn particular spiritual skills.
#### 6. Intuitive Influx and Wisdom
Mystiception often results in an influx of intuition recognized as originating from an external, divine source. This inspiration may relate to the practitioner's current endeavors or provide wisdom on seemingly unrelated matters, prompting contemplation and self-scrutiny. These insights, unrelated to brain-mind or sub-conscious processes, demonstrate the independent processing capabilities of the soul-minds and spirit-minds.
#### 7. Energetic Upward-Reach and Halo Effect
Mystiception creates a brain-conscious experience of one's spirit energies reaching upward through the Sahasrara mind on top of the head, into an energetic field of holiness. This phenomenon forms the basis for the graphics of a halo depicted around the heads of spiritually active or developed individuals. In certain African and Southeast Asian cultures, it is considered disrespectful to touch the top of someone's head as it disrupts their sacred energy and can allow negative energy to be transferred.
#### 8. Intense Love and Divine Connection
Mystiception, the perception of mystical experiences, involves sensing divine energies marked by an intense feeling of love, similar to the profound "falling in love" experience in human relationships. Due to the close resemblance between the experience of falling deeply in love with another person and the love felt from the Divine, it is common for mystics to develop a strong emotional attachment to their chosen deity or spiritual figure, such as Tara in some traditions.
This powerful connection explains the prevalence of love, matrimonial, and sometimes even sexual themes in the writings of mystics across various spiritual traditions. It is important to note that from a mystical perspective, there is nothing inherently "dirty" or "sinful" about sexuality or using the imagery of union with the divine in spiritual contexts.
During intense mystical experiences, this overpowering love dominates one's consciousness, often described as flowing into the Anahata chakra, the energy center associated with the heart. The immense, all-encompassing feeling of love seems to fill every fiber of one's being and wash transformative energies over the soul. As the heightened mysticeptive state subsides, a lingering sense of longing for the divine beloved may persist.
These are just a few examples of the common phenomena that can occur during mystiception. It is important to approach these experiences with discernment and humility, recognizing that not all experiences are necessarily authentic or beneficial. It is essential to maintain a strong foundation of spiritual practice, self-reflection, and ethical living, and to seek the guidance of experienced teachers and mentors when navigating these profound states of consciousness.
These experiences are different for everyone. Ultimately, the purpose of mystiception is not to achieve certain states or experiences, but to awaken to our true purpose becoming eternal spiritual beings, and to live in harmony with this truth in every moment of our lives.
It's best to avoid those who brag about their personal growth and share their experiences solely for show. Spiritual arrogance leads to karmic consequences.
By cultivating a steadfast and dedicated mystical practice, we dissolve the barriers of separation and illusion that confine us in the suffering of perpetual reincarnation, and discover the boundless love, wisdom, and unity that is our birthright.
## 7.1 Navigating the Psychomesion: The Intermediate Realm
According to Wayist spirituality, the Psychomesion is a term used to describe a realm or dimension that exists between the physical reality we experience and the higher spiritual realms. After death of the biological body, souls travel through the Psychomesion to Paradise. Paradise is a contained metaphysical space, like a heaven, within the Psychomesion. Paradise is the transitional heaven where souls process their past human experience and await the next incarnation.
One can understand the Psychomesion through the analogy of a two-lane pathway through a park that separates two cities. One lane, well-secured and guided by Divine Taras, serves souls coming from Paradise to be incarnated on Earth. The other lane is less organized and secured, it accommodates souls departing Earth on their way to Paradise.
Along the path to Paradise, some souls hesitate, unwilling to yield to the compelling force (like a gravity) that propels them towards the illuminating light. Divine Taras, or guiding spirits, accompany individuals on their journey to Paradise, helping to "book them in" to that divine destination. However, some souls may ignore their Divine Tara, or may have never encountered their Tara, and thus become afraid of the powerful energy being beckoning them onward, leading them to resist going to Paradise. As a result, numerous soul beings may remain on the path to Paradise for as long as their energy allows. Unfortunately, these hesitant souls are unhappy or afraid.
Practitioners with skilled Ajna minds may experience mysticeptive visions and encounters in the Psychomesion during their spiritual practice.
Navigating the Psychomesion requires a high level of spiritual discernment and protection, as not all entities encountered in this realm may have benevolent intentions. Wayist practitioners who choose to engage with the Psychomesion must cultivate a strong foundation of spiritual practice, self-reflection, and alignment with the guidance and protection of their Divine Tara.
One of the primary reasons for Wayist practitioners to visit the Psychomesion is to assist the so-called "lost souls" who may linger in this realm, resisting the natural flow toward Paradise and their Divine Tara's guidance. For a human to acknowledge these souls and assure them of the safety and rightness of proceeding to Paradise helps them a lot. One can even, occasionally, help them trust their Divine Tara. Wayists can provide comfort and support based on their own extensive experience with the birth-death cycle.
Wayist energy workers also engage in the practice of exorcism, using their superior spiritual powers to dislodge malevolent entities known as malipsyches (explained in the next section) from the bodies of afflicted individuals. Successful exorcisms banish the malipsyche to the Psychomesion, where they may face the end of their existence because of energy depletion, or the overpowering force of superior energies prevalent there.
It is important to approach the Psychomesion with caution and humility, recognizing that encounters with disembodied entities can be challenging and potentially dangerous. Wayist practitioners who choose to navigate this realm must cultivate a strong connection with their Divine Tara, and maintain a clear intention of service and compassion in all their interactions.
Ultimately, the purpose of navigating the Psychomesion is not to achieve personal power or gain, but to offer assistance and support to souls in need, and to contribute to the greater flow of spiritual evolution and awakening. By approaching this realm with wisdom, chrestotes, and a sound foundation of spiritual practice, Wayist practitioners can become powerful agents of healing and transformation, both for themselves and for the souls they encounter along the way.
## 7.2 Malipsyches: Understanding and Dealing with Malevolent Disembodied Souls
In Wayist spirituality, malipsyches are malevolent disembodied souls or entities believed to have harmful or manipulative intentions. These are souls expelled from Butterfly Path school by the Law of Karma, denied re-entry to Paradise for another human incarnation. Rather than accepting their fate and returning to the Soul Energy Domain, they expend their remaining energies attempting to inhabit a human body through nefarious means.
Malipsyches seek individuals resonating with low vibrational energies --- those harboring and generating the basest soul energies. Using this resonance, they attempt to co-inhabit the body with the resident soul. This phenomenon is akin to what religions term "demonic possession."
When individuals possessed by malipsyches congregate, a group-mind effect can "normalize" states of malintent. The original resident soul is deprived of wholesome nourishment, subsisting on energies leading to destruction. This can form a culture that "infects" others with weak soul energies, similar to how group mentality and popular narratives can sway people's minds and energies.
To illustrate, envision the path to Paradise through the Psychomesion as a park, with swamps flanking the main path. Malipsyches, unable to vibrate at higher frequencies necessary for the main path, lurk in these metaphorical swamps, unable to bear the "light" of the Path.
If a human allows their soul energies to descend to these "swamp levels," a malipsyche can enter through that frequency. If not ejected, it may manipulate the host to engage in the very behaviors that led to its banishment from Paradise. This cycle often ends in tragedy for the human host.
Wayist practitioners encountering malipsyches must approach with utmost caution and discernment. While not inherently more powerful than those with good energies, their capacity for evil often surpasses our imagination, potentially catching one off-guard.
Malipsyches typically employ seduction and deception, often with long-term strategies. They may offer false promises of power, wealth, influence, or secret knowledge. The myth of "selling one's soul" stems from this concept.
Possession or attachment by malipsyches often occurs when individuals are vulnerable --- during intense stress, addiction, or misguided spiritual seeking. In these states, people may resonate with extremely low frequencies, making them susceptible to malipsychic influence.
A poignant example is when those in positions of power descend to states allowing them to cause suffering or objectify others for selfish gains. Skilled malipsyches are drawn to such individuals, excited by the potential for large-scale destruction. They may occupy the soul space of an elected official or powerful person, utilizing all available resources to wreak havoc.
The karmic repercussions for such actions can be severe, potentially spanning multiple lifetimes of suffering under tyrannical rule. While religions might term this "hell," Wayism recognizes it as a form of grace --- a harsh but necessary learning experience for the soul to evolve and rejoin the Path.
It's crucial to note that those who enable or support such malevolent individuals also incur karmic debt. This interconnected web of cause and effect demonstrates the profound responsibility we bear for our choices and actions.
While this may seem like an ever-present danger, most individuals on a spiritual path are far removed from these "swamp energies." Many may have lost the ability to activate such low frequencies lifetimes ago.
For those suspecting malipsychic influence in others, swift and decisive action is necessary, involving experienced Wayist energy workers or exorcists. However, the affected individual must be ready and willing to change their energetic environment to prevent future attachments.
Prevention is key. Cultivating a strong foundation of spiritual protection through regular practices like prayer, meditation, and energy work can create a barrier against malipsychic influence. Self-awareness and reflection are crucial in identifying and transforming any vulnerabilities that malipsyches might exploit.
Through Divine Tarayoga and a deep relationship with one's Divine Tara, Wayist practitioners can develop the spiritual strength and discernment necessary to navigate these challenges and become agents of healing and transformation in the world.
While the topic of malipsyches may seem alarming, it's important to approach it with wisdom, compassion, and a commitment to spiritual growth. By doing so, we contribute to the greater flow of spiritual evolution and awakening, both for ourselves and others, while safeguarding against the very real and historically evident dangers of evil mindsets in our world.
## 7.3 The Transformative Impact of Mystiception on the Spiritual Journey
The experience of mystiception, or heightened spiritual awareness and perception during mystical connections with divine energies, can have a profound and transformative impact on an individual's spiritual journey. These experiences, which often involve a direct and intimate encounter with the divine presence, can catalyze deep shifts in spiritual awareness, and in brain consciousness as understanding becomes part of your knowledge bank. Our behaviour also changes, leading to a greater sense of purpose, meaning, and connection in life.
One of the primary transformative effects of mystiception is a heightened sense of self-awareness and self-understanding. Through the direct experience of divine energies and insights, individuals may gain new perspectives on their own thoughts, emotions, and behaviours, leading to greater clarity and compassion in their relationship with themselves and others.
Mystiception can also lead to a profound sense of interconnectedness and unity with all of life. By experiencing the divine presence that underlies and animates all things, individuals may develop a greater sense of empathy, compassion, and responsibility for the well-being of all beings. This can inspire a commitment to service and stewardship, as individuals seek to align their actions with the greater good of the whole.
Another transformative impact of mystiception is a deepening of faith and trust in the divine. Through the direct experience of divine love, wisdom, and guidance, individuals may develop a greater sense of surrender and receptivity to the flow of life, even in the face of challenges and uncertainties. This can lead to a greater sense of peace, resilience, and equanimity in the face of life's ups and downs.
Mystiception can also catalyze profound shifts in an individual's sense of identity and purpose. By experiencing the immortal and boundless nature of their own being, individuals may begin to let go of limiting beliefs and attachments, and to align their lives with their deepest values and aspirations. This can lead to a greater sense of authenticity, creativity, and fulfillment, as individuals seek to express and embody their unique gifts and talents in service of the greater good.
In addition to these personal transformations, mystiception can also have a profound impact on an individual's relationships and social interactions. By cultivating greater empathy, compassion, simplicity, and humbleness comes understanding. Through the experience of divine connection, individuals may develop more harmonious and fulfilling relationships with others, based on mutual respect, trust, and support.
Mystiception can also inspire individuals to become agents of change and transformation in their communities and the world at large. By aligning their actions with the wisdom and guidance of the divine, individuals may feel called to use their unique gifts and talents to address social and environmental challenges, and to contribute to the greater flow of spiritual evolution and awakening.
Ultimately, the transformative impact of mystiception on the spiritual journey is a deeply personal and individual process, shaped by each person's unique experiences, beliefs, and aspirations. However, by approaching these experiences with openness, humility, and a commitment to spiritual growth and service, individuals can harness the power of mystiception to catalyze profound shifts in their lives and in the world around them.
Through the practice of Divine Tarayoga, Karman Active Meditation, and other Wayist spiritual disciplines, individuals can cultivate the conditions for deeper and more transformative experiences of mystiception, and can develop the spiritual strength and discernment necessary to integrate these experiences into their daily lives.
By embracing the transformative potential of mystiception, and by aligning their lives with the wisdom and guidance of the divine, Wayist practitioners can become powerful agents of healing, awakening, and transformation, both for themselves and for others.

## Theopathy:
### Experiencing Profound Divine Connection
In Wayist spirituality, Theopathy represents the pinnacle of the mystical journey, a state of profound divine connection and communion that arises as a result of sustained spiritual practice and devotion.
It is a state in which the individual's spiritual cognizance merges with the infinite expanse of divine love and wisdom, and they experience the deepest sense of unity, understanding, and purpose that transcends the limitations of the soul and brain minds.
At its core, Theopathy is a direct and immediate experience of the divine, one that is not mediated by concepts, beliefs, or intellectual understanding. It is a state of pure awareness and presence, in which the individual becomes a clear and radiant channel for the flow of divine grace and inspiration.
## 8.1 Theopathic Attunement and Resonance
In Wayist spirituality, Theopathic Attunement and Resonance refer to the progressive stages of spiritual development that follow the Theopathic Nexus, and represent a deepening of an individual's connection and communion with the divine. These stages are marked by a profound alignment of the individual's spiritual awareness and energy with the subtle dimensions and frequencies of the divine realm, and a growing capacity for direct and sustained experience of divine presence and love.
As an individual progresses in their practice of Theopathic Attunement, they begin to experience a gradual refinement and purification of their consciousness and energy bodies. They may begin to perceive subtle dimensions and frequencies of reality that were previously hidden or obscured, and to experience a growing sense of inner peace, clarity, and connection to the divine.
At the same time, the individual's capacity for spiritual discernment and wisdom begins to deepen and expand. They become more attuned to the guidance and inspiration of their Divine Tara, and more skillful in navigating the complex terrain of the spiritual path.
As Theopathic Attunement deepens and matures, it begins to give way to a state of Theopathic Resonance, in which the individual's consciousness and energy become fully aligned and harmonized with the divine. In this state, the individual experiences a profound sense of unity, love, and understanding, as their own being begins to merge with the infinite expanse of divine presence and awareness.
Theopathic Resonance is often described as a state of ecstatic communion and oneness with the divine, in which the individual's sense of separate self dissolves into the vast ocean of divine love and wisdom. It is a state of profound surrender and trust, in which the individual becomes a clear and radiant channel for the flow of divine grace and inspiration.
In Wayist practice, the cultivation of Theopathic Attunement and Resonance is seen as a gradual and ongoing process, one that requires a deep and sustained commitment to spiritual practice and devotion. It is not a state that can be achieved through force of will or ego-driven striving, but rather a natural unfolding that arises as a result of sincere and consistent effort.
## 8.2 Theopathic Mystical Experiences: In the presence of Heavenly Energies
### In the presence of Heavenly Energies
### The Theopathic Nexus: A Pivotal Point in the Mystical Journey
Deep within the state of Mystiception, we progress toward a pivotal point known as the Theopathic nexus. The Theopathic Nexus represents a more refined manifestation of the Mysticeptive gateway. When we are properly prepared, we can enter the Theopathic Nexus and resonate with the lowest available energy domain of the theopathic state. In that deeply sacred sanctuary, which has no utility other than to receive those of us who reached that level of training. There, the energies of the higher-ranking deities, God our Father and God our Mother in heaven, is not shielded to the same degrees than before. As fledgling spiritual beings, we can access the Theopathic state, where the presence of God is overwhelmingly intense. Step by step we proceed through the grades of preparing for rebirth as immortal spiritual beings.
> When Lord Jesus was about to leave this world, his Galilean followers expressed their willingness to go after him, saying, "*Lord, where are you going? We are ready to follow you.*" Lord Jesus replied, "*You are not able to go where I am going.*"
> 
> The ability to survive in the presence of deities and navigate beyond the Theopathic Nexus requires spiritual maturity, spiritual skills, wisdom, exceptional love for the Divine, humbleness, simplicity, and loving-kindness. Without these qualities, one will not be able to endure and may perish.
Through this training, we mature and develop our spirit and acquire greater capabilities than ever before. We learn to attune to the energies beyond the theopathic Nexus. We dedicate ourselves to mastering the management of Theopathic resonance.
> *One can draw a crude parallel to the above by imagining our spiritual machinery must be upgraded to manage a higher workload, so we need a more robust energy transformer, higher gauge wiring and industrial sized fail-safe protectors and insulators.*
One of the key practices for cultivating the Theopathic Nexus is the practice of Divine Tarayoga, or the yoga of union with one's Divine Tara. Through this practice, individuals learn to subject their soul-minds to the control of spirit-minds. The caterpillar yields to the call, and surrenders to the process of becoming transformed into a Butterly.
Once an individual has crossed the threshold of the Theopathic Nexus, they enter into a new stage of the mystical journey, one that is marked by a much more profound sense of unity, love, and understanding. In this stage, the individual's consciousness begins to merge with the divine spirit within, and they experience a deep sense of communion and oneness with all of creation.
Soon, it will be impractical to continue on earth and the spirit is reborn in Sukhavati heaven, where it will exist to the end of immortality.
## 8.3 Theopathic Communion: The Height of Mystical Experience
In Wayist spirituality, Theopathic Communion represents the ultimate height of mystical experience, a state of profound unity and oneness with the divine that transcends all dualities and distinctions. It is a state in which the individual's consciousness merges completely with the divine mind of Heaven which is characterized by energies of passion, divine love and wisdom so intense its light keeps all other entities away. Almost as the sun is too much energy to approach. In Sanskrit, the designation for God our father in heaven is, Amitabha, meaning Illimitable Light.
At its core, Theopathic Communion is a direct and immediate experience of the divine, one that is not mediated by any sense of separation or individuality. In this state, the individual's sense of self dissolves completely into the vast ocean of divine presence and awareness, and they become one with the eternal truth and love that underlies all of creation.
The experience of Theopathic Communion is often described in terms of profound ecstasy, bliss, and rapture, as the individual's entire being is suffused with the infinite love and joy of the divine. At the same time, it is a state of profound stillness and peace, in which all the turbulence and agitation of the mind and emotions are stilled, and the individual rests in the eternal present moment.
In Wayist practice, the cultivation of Theopathic Communion is seen as the ultimate goal of the spiritual path, the fruition of all spiritual practice and devotion. It is not a state that can be achieved through any technique or method, but rather through the grace of Butterfly Path. It takes many, many, human lifetimes to graduate from our school of divinity for souls.
> Many of us will reach the completion of the mystical path in Paradise, where we will be immersed in eternal serenity and beauty. Those of us with the intense training and wisdom of Wayism will be spared the need to fully master the skills of the Theopathic nexus on Earth, instead reserving it for our time in Paradise.
> 
> With the guidance of buddhas and deities, we will undergo coaching and workshops to cultivate the skills needed for the butterfly to break free from its cocoon and expand its fragile wings, symbolizing our own journey into immortality.
> 
> We will then ascend to Sukhavati, guided by our Tara, and be received in Heaven as a member of the Holy Lotus Family.
To prepare for and cultivate the experience of Theopathic Communion, Wayist practitioners engage in a variety of spiritual practices and disciplines, such as Divine Tarayoga, Karman Active Meditation, and devotional service.
These practices help to purify the mind and heart, and to attune the individual's consciousness to allow spirit to dwell in the subtle energies and dimensions of the divine realm.

Chapter 9
## Integrating Mystical Practices
### A Lifestyle of Spirituality
We start this chapter with the story of when Mirabai (16th century) went to the market to buy a stone statue of the Lord for her home shrine, an act that scandalized her family's reputation.
Mirabai's public religious devotion was heavily scrutinized due to her upcoming marriage to a prominent individual. Public displays of emotion was not up to her social class. And so was going to the market, not her class, that is a job for staff. And to attract attention to self by singing, or worse, be so uncouth as to play an instrument like a lowly entertainer, the worst allegation. But to add insult to injury is when the husband's family acuses you of overpaying for an item in the market.
Mirabai's mystical relationship with her Lord, however, was her primary focus and she completely disregarded societal class rules, which caused many a scandal. She was set against the royal wedding and tried many times to wrangle out of it. She would much rather beg on the streets and worship all day, than marry into a wealthy household with its inauthentic lifestyle. One particular day, she went to the market and again stirred up gossip. She wrote a poem to confirm the allegations of the gossip.
Mirabai bought a black stone sculpture of Lord Krishna, who, in Sanskrit texts, is described as having dark, dusty-blue skin like monsoon clouds. Folk poetry celebrates his dusky complexion, emphasizing his connection to nature and the cosmos. As a pastoral and grounded deity, his tanned skin reflected his earthly existence as an avatar wandering through forests and fields as a peasant boy. This embodied his compassion and empathy for humanity. Mirabai beat her drum, singing prayers while in the market. This is her poem about the event:
#### * It's True I Went to the Market*
*My friend, I went to the market and bought the Dark One.*
*You say by night, I say by day.*
*.*
*Actually I was beating a drum all the time I was buying him.*
*You say I gave too much; I say too little.*
*.*
*Actually, I put him on a scale before I bought him.*
*What I paid was my social body, my town body, my family body, and all my inherited jewels.*
*.*
*Mirabai says: The Dark One is my husband now.*
*Be with me when I lie down Lord; you promised me this in an earlier life.*
*~ Mirabai*
## 9.1 Creating a Sacred Space for Prayer and Meditation
Creating a sacred space for prayer and meditation is an essential aspect of integrating Wayist practices into daily life. By setting aside a dedicated area for spiritual practice, individuals can cultivate a sense of reverence, focus, and intention, and can create the conditions for deeper experiences of connection and transformation.
A sacred space can be any area of the home or workplace that is set aside for spiritual practice, whether it is a separate room, a corner of a bedroom, or a small altar on a desk or shelf. The key is to create a space that is reserved exclusively for this sacred purpose, and feels peaceful, uplifting, and conducive to inner reflection and divine connection.
### When creating a sacred space, here are a few considerations to keep in mind:
#### 1. Location
When selecting a location, it is important to choose one that is both quiet and private, ensuring that you are free from any distractions that may hinder your focus. If it is feasible, we recommend choosing a space that offers natural light and fresh air, as these elements have been known to contribute to a heightened sense of clarity and vitality. It is customary for us to refrain from placing images of deities on the floor or at a height lower than ourselves. Additionally, it is important to remember that these images should never be treated as home décor, but rather as sacred objects for devotional purposes.
#### 2. Cleanliness
It is important to maintain cleanliness in the shrine space as a way to show respect for oneself and the sacred process, therefore keeping it clean and free of clutter is highly recommended. When your home and surroundings are kept clean and organized, it can greatly contribute to a heightened sense of mental and emotional clarity. To maintain a fresh and uplifting atmosphere, it is worth considering the use of natural oils and cleaning products.
#### 3. Altar
One way to enhance your spiritual practice is by creating a small altar or shrine that can serve as a central point for your prayers and meditation. Some of the items that can be included in this category are candles, incense, crystals, sacred images or statues, and personal mementos that hold spiritual significance.
#### 4. Cushions and Mats
Provide comfortable cushions or mats for sitting or kneeling during meditation and prayer. Choose materials that are natural and breathable, such as cotton or wool, to promote a sense of grounding and connection to the earth.
#### 5. Lighting
When it comes to lighting, it is recommended to utilize soft and natural lighting as it has the ability to establish a calming and inspiring ambiance. To create an atmosphere of maximum focus and enhance the ambience in darkened rooms, one can incorporate various lighting options such as candles, low light salt lamps, or string lights, each of which will contribute to a warm and inviting glow that fills the space.
#### 6. Sound
To create a more immersive experience in the sacred space, you might want to think about including a sound element, such as a singing bowl, chime, mantra music, or even a small fountain. In order to cultivate a mindset of devotion, it is recommended to carefully choose a sound that you reserve for sacred purposes and regularly train your brain-mind to it. By utilizing these specific sounds, individuals can cultivate an atmosphere of calmness and tranquility, thereby enhancing their meditation and prayer sessions.
#### 7. Nature
To enhance the sacredness of the space, consider introducing natural elements such as plants, flowers, butterfly wings, feathers, or stones. By incorporating these natural elements into your life, you can establish a deep connection with other soul beings, the earth, and the divine, ultimately fostering a profound sense of grounding and vitality.
Once the sacred space is created, it is important to use it regularly and consistently for prayer and meditation. By setting aside dedicated time each day for spiritual practice, individuals can cultivate a sense of discipline, focus, and commitment to their spiritual path. This is important not only for devotional practice but also for character building and self-empowerment.
When entering the sacred space with your energies, it is important to do so with a sense of reverence and intention. This may involve taking a few moments to centre oneself, to offer a prayer of gratitude or invocation, or to set an intention for the practice session.
During the spiritual practice session, it is important to maintain a sense of presence, openness, and receptivity to the divine. This may involve using techniques such as breath awareness, mantra recitation, or visualization to cultivate and maintain a state of intention, inner stillness and clarity.
After the spiritual practice session, it is important to take a few moments to integrate the experiences and insights that arose during the practice. This may involve journaling, contemplation, or simply sitting in silence and allowing the energy of the practice to settle and permeate one's being.
By creating and maintaining a sacred space for prayer and meditation, individuals can deepen their connection to the divine, cultivate greater self-awareness and insight, and support their overall spiritual growth and transformation.
Through the consistent and dedicated use of this space, individuals can create a powerful anchor for their spiritual practice, and can access the wisdom, guidance, and support of the divine in all areas of their lives.
## 9.2 Developing a Regular Practice: Tips and Strategies
Developing a regular practice of prayer, meditation, and other Wayist spiritual disciplines is essential for cultivating a deep and transformative connection with the divine. By committing to a consistent and dedicated practice, individuals can create the inner conditions and brain-mind training for profound spiritual growth, insight, and transformation.
However, developing a regular practice can be challenging, particularly in the midst of busy and demanding lives. The following tips and strategies can help individuals to establish and maintain a consistent and effective spiritual practice:
#### 1. Develop a Practical Schedule
Decide on the most suitable time of day for your practice and make a genuine commitment to follow it. It is important to find a time that feels manageable and sustainable, whether it is first thing in the morning, during a lunch break, or before bed, and try to stick to it as closely as possible. It is important to note that there are no religious or spiritual expectations dictating the need to follow a schedule, pray, or engage in meditation. We engage in this activity for multiple reasons: firstly, for our personal growth and development, proving to ourselves and Tara that we are prioritizing the purpose of life; secondly, to cultivate self-discipline; thirdly, to enhance our spiritual and cognitive faculties; and lastly, to relish the sacred joy of spending time with our beloved Tara. Now, keep in mind that the seasoned Wayist master may not have a schedule like this because they have cultivated the skills and lifestyle to be immersed in spirituality, they live a sacred mindset, a meditative state, and in very frequent connection with their Tara. It becomes a lifestyle. But it starts with self-discipline, commitment, and desire for the divine.
#### 2. Start Small
If you are just beginning your journey into spiritual practice, it is advisable to start small by engaging in short sessions lasting only a few minutes. As your comfort level and experience grow, you can progressively increase the amount of time you spend in each session. Consistency is key when it comes to practicing, and even just a few minutes a day is better than attempting long sessions that may feel overwhelming or impossible to maintain. As you continue to develop your spiritual skills, it is crucial to allow for organic growth in your practice, adapting it to meet your increasing needs.
#### 3. Use Reminders
Set reminders on your phone or calendar to help you stay on track with your practice. Subscribe to a reminder service from a Wayist community for notices about upcoming observational days and events. You can also use physical reminders, such as leaving your meditation cushion or prayer beads in a visible location, to help you stay accountable to your practice.
#### 4. Create a Supportive Environment
As discussed in the previous section, creating a sacred space for your practice can help to create a sense of focus, intention, and reverence. Make sure your practice space is comfortable, inviting, and free from distractions.
#### 5. Experiment with Different Techniques
There are many different techniques and approaches to prayer, meditation, and other spiritual disciplines. Experiment with different methods to find what works best for you, and don't be afraid to modify or adapt techniques to suit your individual needs and preferences.
#### 6. Practice with Others
Joining a spiritual community or practice group can provide support, accountability, and inspiration for your practice. Whether it is attending a weekly meditation class, participating in a prayer circle, or connecting with others online, practicing with others can help to deepen your commitment and enhance your experience of the divine.
#### 7. Be Patient and Compassionate
Developing a regular spiritual practice is a gradual process, and it is important to be patient and compassionate with yourself along the way. If you miss a day or have a difficult session, simply acknowledge it and recommit to your practice without judgment or self-criticism.
#### 8. Enhance your sense of humor and your senses of joy and awe
Sharing space with soul-beings of all so many kinds provides a lot of material for a comedy show. Life is truly very funny if you allow yourself the freedom to go there. Go there! Life with nature so close and the miracles of biology and physiology at our fingertips provides more than ample opportunities to be overwhelmed by awe. Only caterpillars have problems with joy, butterflies give themselves to joy with pagan abandon, like little children. Go there! There are no dour or austere beings in Heaven. Start practicing to be a deity.
Some religious traditions mandate scheduled regular prayer times and strict observance of religious events throughout the year. Often, these are accompanied by dietary specifications, such as fasting, eating particular foods, cutting out certain foods, wearing certain clothes, and making sacrifices like donations to the movement to further awareness among those who are unfamiliar with it.
In Wayism, we believe that spirituality is a personal journey, and each individual must take responsibility for their own spiritual growth. We do not enforce strict rules or mandates regarding prayer, meditation, or spiritual practices. Instead, we encourage devotees to engage in these activities voluntarily, driven by their own desire to cultivate a deeper connection with the divine and to follow a higher path.
We understand that simply attending religious events or following a set of practices without genuine engagement will not lead to substantial spiritual growth. Wayism attracts individuals who are committed to their personal development and who aspire to embody the teachings of senior spirit-people. By embracing the principle that they are the masters of their own spiritual journey, Wayists take ownership of their progress without fear of judgment, punishment, or shame for non-attendance.
While this approach may be more challenging for devotees, as it requires self-motivation and discipline, we believe it is essential for true spiritual maturity. Our lack of enforced rules, moral codes (you have your Dharma, your own personal moral code), and regulations, does not stem from a lack of care or concern for our members' spiritual well-being. Rather, we recognize that authentic spiritual growth occurs when an individual willingly chooses to walk the higher path, not because they are compelled to do so by external pressures.
In Wayism, we meet you where you are on your spiritual journey, respecting your unique needs, desires, and level of commitment. We acknowledge that no one can force another to mature spiritually; it is a process that unfolds naturally as a result of one's inner longing and willingness to grow. Your presence and participation in our community reflect your personal readiness to embrace the teachings and to walk the path of Wayism.
All of Wayist spiritual discipline build self-discipline and character, which in turn brings wholesomeness and prosperity to the devotee. Ultimately, people judge the spirituality as a whole based on the actions and behavior of its adherents.
#### 9. Integrate Practice into Daily Life
Look for opportunities to integrate your spiritual practice into your daily life, such as bringing mindfulness to your work, relationships, or leisure activities. By infusing your daily life with the energy and intention of your practice, you can create a more seamless and integrated experience of the divine.
#### 10. Seek Guidance and Support
If you are struggling with your practice or have questions about your spiritual path, don't hesitate to seek guidance and support from experienced teachers, mentors, or spiritual counselors. These individuals can provide valuable insights, encouragement, and resources to help you deepen and sustain your practice.
#### 11. Celebrate Your Progress
Take time to acknowledge and celebrate your progress and growth along the way. Whether it is noticing a shift in your perspective, experiencing a moment of profound insight, or simply showing up for your practice each day, celebrate the small victories and milestones that mark your spiritual journey.
#### 12. Incorporate the Devotional Calendar into your life
The Wayist Devotional Calendar celebrates various events of significance to your spirituality throughout the year.
By implementing these strategies, individuals can develop a regular and transformative spiritual practice that supports their overall growth, well-being, and connection to the divine. Through consistent and dedicated effort, individuals can cultivate the strong character, inner resources, wisdom, and resilience needed to navigate the challenges and opportunities of life with greater grace, clarity, and purpose.
Ultimately, developing a regular spiritual practice is a deeply personal and individual journey, shaped by each person's unique needs and aspirations. By approaching this journey with openness, curiosity, and a willingness to learn and grow, individuals can create a practice that is both deeply meaningful and transformative, and that supports their highest aspirations for spiritual growth and service.
## 9.3 Overcoming Common Challenges and Obstacles
Developing and maintaining a regular spiritual practice is not always easy, and individuals may encounter a variety of challenges and obstacles along the way. By anticipating and preparing for these challenges, individuals can develop the resilience, flexibility, and determination needed to sustain their practice over time.
### Some of the more common challenges and obstacles to spiritual practice include:
#### 1. Lack of Time
In today's fast-paced and demanding world, finding time for spiritual practice can be a significant challenge. Between work, family, and other commitments, it can be difficult to carve out dedicated time for prayer, meditation, and other spiritual disciplines.
When you commit to the higher path of Wayism, you make a conscious choice to prioritize spirituality in your life. This decision involves making changes to your lifestyle to incorporate and elevate spiritual practices. It is a significant step that should not be taken lightly, as it requires a shift in perspective and a willingness to adjust your priorities.
As Wayists, we adopt a spirituality mindset and worldview that permeates every aspect of our lives. We see the world and the meaning of things differently than we did before embarking on this path. It is as if we develop an attitude of spirituality that guides our thoughts, actions, and interactions.
Despite the challenges posed by our busy lives, we recognize the importance of making time in our schedules for regular sessions with our Divine Tara or chosen deity. These moments of connection and devotion are essential to our spiritual growth and well-being. By carving out dedicated time for spiritual practice, we reaffirm our commitment to the higher path and ensure that our spiritual development remains a central focus in our lives.
#### 2. Distractions and Interruptions
Even when people do find time for their practice, they may be easily distracted or interrupted by external stimuli, such as noise, technology, or other people. These distractions can make it difficult to cultivate the focus, presence, and inner stillness needed for deep spiritual practice.
As Wayists, we view these inevitable disruptions as an integral part of the privilege of living in a community with people and other living beings. Rather than seeing them as obstacles, we recognize that they create the world in which we hone our spiritual skills. These challenges provide opportunities for us to take charge of our environment and structure it in a way that promotes wholesomeness and supports our spiritual growth.
In some cases, we may have the ability to modify our surroundings to minimize distractions and create a more conducive atmosphere for spiritual practice. However, there may be instances where changing our environment is not possible, such as in a past life when we lived with eight siblings in a single-room house. In these situations, we accept the challenge and work even harder to develop the skills necessary to zone out the distractions and focus our attention on Divine Tara.
By embracing the distractions and interruptions as part of our spiritual journey, we cultivate resilience, adaptability, and a deeper sense of commitment to our practice. We learn to find stillness and connection amidst the chaos, strengthening our ability to maintain a spiritual focus in all aspects of our lives. Through this process, we grow in our capacity to create a sacred space within ourselves, regardless of the external circumstances we may face.
#### 3. Physical Discomfort
Sitting for long periods of time, particularly in meditation or prayer, can be physically uncomfortable or even painful for some individuals. This discomfort can make it difficult to sustain a practice over time and can lead to feelings of frustration or discouragement.
It is important to recognize that the reason why many Westerners sit in a so-called "yoga position" during meditation is because they have observed Indian people sitting in this manner. In Indian culture, people are accustomed to a lifestyle that involves sitting closer to the floor, whether it be while working at low tables or when eating and lounging. As a result of their regular seating habits, Indians often report being able to sit for extended periods without experiencing "pinched nerves" or other forms of discomfort.
However, for individuals who are not from cultures with similar seating practices, attempting to sit in these positions may prove challenging and uncomfortable for their bodies. It is crucial to understand that there is no inherent connection between the effectiveness of prayer and meditation and the specific position in which one sits.
As Wayists, we encourage individuals to find a comfortable and sustainable posture that allows them to focus on their spiritual practice without undue physical strain. This may involve sitting on a cushion, using a chair, or even lying down if necessary.
The key is to create a physical environment that supports your ability to cultivate inner stillness and connection with the divine, rather than adhering to a predetermined posture that may cause discomfort and distract from your spiritual intentions.
By prioritizing comfort and sustainability in your physical posture, you enable yourself to engage more fully in your spiritual practice, allowing the focus to remain on your inner journey rather than on managing physical discomfort. Remember, the power of prayer and meditation lies in the sincerity of your intention and the depth of your connection, not in the specific way you choose to sit.
That said. Saying "good night" to Divine Tara before you fall asleep, and "good morning, Lord," upon waking, are perhaps the most beautiful and efficacious prayers or meditations one can do.
#### 4. Mental and Emotional Resistance
The mind and emotions can also present significant challenges to spiritual practice. Thoughts, worries, and other mental distractions can make it difficult to cultivate inner stillness and clarity, while difficult emotions such as anxiety, anger, or sadness can arise during practice and challenge one's equanimity and focus.
As Wayists, we encourage you to evaluate what is happening in your soul-minds and to understand why they are making such demanding claims on your attention. If, after careful consideration, you determine that it is appropriate to suppress their needs, you can do so by willfully taking charge over them with a higher mind. This involves consciously redirecting your focus and energy towards your spiritual practice, even in the face of mental and emotional distractions.
However, it is equally important to recognize that the feelings, worries, and emotions arising from your soul-minds may be an essential part of your spiritual development. In such cases, the most effective approach is to incorporate these concerns into your prayer and openly discuss them with your Divine Tara. Allow yourself to express your thoughts and feelings fully, elaborating on the details and nuances of your inner experience.
All too often when, as a concerned citizen, you take a stroll into the soul to investigate what the fuss is about, you must take a step back and watch. Often it's a zoo or a jungle, and the animals all have things to say, each insisting their needs must be the zookeepers priority. Why are the monkeys listless and demanding today? Oh, yes. That's what monkeys do. It's their nature. And the lion, why so assertive and bearing down on others with stern looks? Oh, yes, that's what Manipura chakra does. It's in his nature. And why are the warthogs, fire ants, and gazelle so worried and anxious? Yup, it's their nature. Manipura is like that. And those very noisy parrots and parakeets with their lavish clothing, pretending, acting, and oh so loud? Ah, yes, that's what Svadhistana minds do. The ego is a heck of a thing to live with. Often, the zookeeper comes away from introspection to conclude that not all emotions are valid and definitely not all shall be allowed to be expressed.
As you engage in this process, remember to pause periodically to allow your higher-self to receive guidance and wisdom. Create space for your inner being to receive and embrace Divine Tara's compassion and comforting presence. By doing so, you open yourself to the transformative power of divine love and understanding, which can help you navigate the challenges of your mental and emotional landscape.
This type of prayer, as you will note in the rest of this book, is of great significance and should lead to notable self-psychotherapy. By engaging in an honest and open dialogue with the divine, you create opportunities for deep self-reflection, healing, and personal growth. Through this process, you can gain invaluable insights into your own psyche and develop a greater sense of inner peace and resilience in the face of life's challenges.
#### 5. Lack of Motivation or Inspiration
Over time, individuals may lose motivation or inspiration for their spiritual practice, particularly if they are not experiencing the results or benefits they had hoped for, or when they allow life to get in the way, as it is designed to do by those who do social engineering. This lack of motivation can lead to inconsistency or even abandonment of the practice altogether.
Navigating through these "dry spells" can be one of the most challenging aspects of spiritual development. During these periods, we may feel disconnected from our Divine Tara and fear that we may never regain that precious connection. The struggle to re-engage with our practice can be overwhelming, leaving us feeling lost and alone on our spiritual path.
While it may offer little immediate comfort, it is important to remember that these dark periods are a natural part of the spiritual journey. All seekers, at some point, face these trials. We who have been there want to assure other that your connection to the Divine will return, if not in this life, then in the next, or when our Karma presents us with a profound learning opportunity that brings us back to our spiritual practice.
During these challenging times, it can be helpful to draw strength from the knowledge that countless others have walked this path before us and have emerged from their own dark nights of the soul. Whether lasting weeks or years, these periods of spiritual drought are temporary, and the light of divine connection will shine upon us once again. Often, when we re-engage, it is with a higher intensity because of what Karma helped us to learn during the dark period.
It is therefore crucial to cherish and fully embrace the times of spiritual clarity and connection when they are present in our lives. By holding these moments close to our hearts, we create a reservoir of inspiration and faith that can sustain us through the inevitable dry spells.
#### 6. Mind-altering medication
In the field of psychology and psychiatry, mind-altering medication is classified as either psychoactive drugs or psychotropic drugs. Their function is to modify the nervous system, causing changes in perception, mood, cognition, and behavior.
Some people may find it challenging or even impossible to establish a spiritual connection with the Divine while taking prescribed mental health medication. It is essential to understand that the challenge lies not within the spirit-minds, but rather in the chemically induced changes in the biological body's brain-mind and, to some extent, the soul-minds.
The brain-mind, under the influence of medication, may struggle to relate to the spiritual experience and the accompanying emotions. As a result, the body may not perceive the mystical connection and emotional resonance that occurs within the soul-minds. While this can be a source of consolation, knowing that the soul and spirit are still engaging in the spiritual experience, it does not negate the fact that the individual may lack motivation to continue their practice due to the absence of tangible rewards.
It is worth noting that people living with dementia face a similar challenge, as their brain's ability to recognize and process their spirit's active engagement with their Divine Tara may be compromised. However, it is crucial to remember that even when the organic brain sleeps or dies, the soul and spirit continue to exist, their minds as active and alive as ever.
So, when the brain-mind doesn't get in the way, the soul-minds and spirit-minds encounter fewer obstacles. Soul-minds may reveal their unpleasant side when not filtered by brain-mind. However, the spirit-minds can be highly active and make rapid progress.
Consider the early stages of human development, when the soul-spirit incarnates into the fetus. Despite the fact that the organic brain-mind is not yet fully developed, the age-old soul and spirit are already actively living within the body.
Remarkably, individuals who have maintained a consistent spiritual practice over many years often demonstrate greater resilience in the face of late-onset dementia. The strong neural pathways formed through years of devotion and practice become second nature, allowing them to maintain a connection to their divine even as their brain-cognitive abilities decline.
It is not uncommon to witness people with dementia in hospice situations expressing their love for the Divine and cherishing precious memories of their spiritual experiences. The knowledge that they will soon walk into Paradise with their Divine Tara brings them solace and optimism.
Bodhidharma, the 6th century iconic teacher of theWAY, describes a deluded brain-mind as someone who attaches importance to the forms and conventions of life, perceiving them as real.
The only way to experience authentic reality is for the brain-mind to be inactive and the spirit to be active.
#### * A Deluded Mind*
*A deluded brain-mind is hell.*
*Without delusions.*
*the mind is the country of the Buddhas.*
*When the brain-mind creates the idea of the mind.*
*people are deluded and in hell.*
*Those established on the path to Buddhahood*
*don't use the brain-mind to create the idea*
*of the mind and so are always*
*in the country of the Buddhas.*
*When the brain-mind is always moving, you travel*
*from one hell to the next hell.*
*If you use your brain-mind to try and understand reality.*
*you will understand neither your mind nor reality.*
*If you try and understand reality without using your brain-mind.*
*you will understand both your mind and reality.*
*~ Bodhidharma*
### To overcome the common challenges and obstacles, individuals can employ a variety of strategies and techniques, such as:
#### 1. Prioritizing and Scheduling
Make spiritual practice a priority in your life, and schedule it into your day as you would any other important commitment. Be willing to let go of lesser priorities or distractions in order to create space for your practice.
#### 2. Creating a Supportive Environment
As discussed earlier, creating a sacred space for your practice can help to minimize distractions and interruptions, and can create a sense of focus and intention. Consider using earplugs, white noise, or other tools to block out external noise and create a more conducive environment for practice.
#### 3. Modifying Postures and Techniques
If physical discomfort is a challenge, experiment with different postures, cushions, or other supports to find what works best for your body. You can also try alternative techniques such as walking meditation, or chi gong to incorporate movement and physical awareness into your practice.
#### 4. Developing Mental and Emotional Resilience
Cultivate a sense of patience, compassion, and non-attachment in the face of mental and emotional challenges. Recognize that thoughts and emotions are temporary and transient, and practice letting them pass without getting caught up in them. You can also use techniques such as labeling, noting, or visualization to work with difficult mind states and cultivate greater equanimity and clarity. Speak to your Divine Tara about soul-minds that are disturbing; sometimes soul-minds are like toddlers and need help with self-control --- spiritual energy can help to subdue them. Remember, the object of life is to one day sanctify all of our soul-minds, and then we will know true peace of mind.
#### 5. Seeking Inspiration and Support
Stay connected to sources of inspiration and support for your practice, such as spiritual texts, teachings, or communities. Attend retreats, workshops, or other events to deepen your understanding and experience of the practices, and to connect with others who share your aspirations and values.
#### 6. Energy-Hygiene
As we navigate through our daily lives and interact with various aspects of normative society, we inevitably come into contact with a wide range of energies emanating from people at different stages of their spiritual journey. Just as positive energy, such as that experienced during a devotional session or in the presence of a forest or large body of water, can profoundly affect us and linger, altering our own energies, strong negative energies also attach themselves to us and influence our energy field.
Just as a holy energy is infused in the structure of a well used temple or cathedral, so too the negative energies of a troubled household is infused in the structure of a home. It affects people who visit, changes their energies.
In the same way that we maintain a regular hygiene routine for our biological body, allowing waste and used food to be expelled and washing away the dirt and pollution of the day, we must also attend to the well-being of our metaphysical body. Similarly to how germs and toxins cling to the organic body, and how it can be present in the food we eat, so too with negative energies--they attach to our energy body. It is essential to engage in a metaphysical cleansing process, allowing the waste or used energies to flow out and return to the Earth.
Failing to adhere to a strict energy maintenance and hygiene routine can result in a tainted energy body, which may suffer adverse consequences.
#### How can we effectively cleanse and reset our energies on a daily basis?
There are several methods to accomplish this goal. The most efficient approach is to engage in a meeting with your Divine Tara, during which you metaphysically inhale the divine energies and allow them to wash through all your chakra minds, releasing the unwanted and waste energies into the fuel of the devotional candle, for instance.
Another effective way to cleanse your energies is to take a physical shower (as physical cleanliness is of utmost importance for a Wayist) and simultaneously perform a cleansing meditation. During this meditation, visualize discarding all the negative energy down the drain while absorbing Divine Tara energy through the Sahasrara chakra (located above your head) and allowing it to flow through your metaphysical body.
A third recommended method is Karman Active Meditation, which involves a series of movements and exercises designed to release unwanted energy and recharge your being with positive spiritual energy. Karman Active Meditation is known as a body, mind, soul, and spirit maintenance routine.
Just as brushing your teeth, consuming nutritious food, and maintaining proper hand hygiene are crucial for physical well-being, taking care of your energy hygiene is equally vital. By prioritizing energy cleansing and maintenance, you ensure that your metaphysical self remains balanced, harmonious, and conducive to spiritual growth and well-being. And that you are not infecting others, or your home, with the metaphysical equivalent of germs and toxins.
By employing these strategies and techniques, individuals can develop the resilience, flexibility, and determination needed to overcome the common challenges and obstacles to spiritual practice. Through consistent and dedicated effort, individuals can cultivate a practice that is both sustainable and transformative, and that supports their highest aspirations for spiritual growth and service.
Ultimately, the challenges and obstacles that arise in spiritual practice can be seen as opportunities for growth and transformation, rather than as barriers or limitations. By approaching these challenges with patience, compassion, and a willingness to learn and adapt, individuals can deepen their understanding of themselves and the divine, and can cultivate the inner resources and wisdom needed to navigate the complexities of the spiritual path with greater ease and grace.
## 9.4 The Role of Spiritual Community and Support
The role of spiritual community and support is crucial in the Wayist tradition, as it provides a sense of belonging, encouragement, and accountability for individuals on their spiritual path. By connecting with others who share similar values, aspirations, and practices, individuals can deepen their understanding and experience of the divine, and can receive the guidance, inspiration, and support needed to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the spiritual journey.
In the eyes of a Wayist, all communities of soul-beings at any level of development hold the potential for personal growth and learning. In our pursuit of owning our own mind, we actively listen to divergent opinions and carefully evaluate them. Were not talking about other spiritual philosophies, because we know what we have is right for us. But we do listen how others think, when it is interesting to learn. Which allows us to not only learn about ourselves but also gain insights into the perspectives of others. As part of our commitment to personal growth, we constantly challenge ourselves to explore social and political ideas that are beyond our usual frame of reference, including those that contradict our long-held beliefs. The community plays a crucial role in the development and honing of numerous spiritual skills. But do note. There will come a time in every Wayist's life when nothing much out there is interesting anymore, because life after life we find its all the same and its getting old hat now. Then, we prefer to keep the cocoon mindset and work our way Home to Heaven.
While all humans are by default on Butterfly Path, and are free to indulge in any religion or spirituality or nothing as such at all, only senior students on the Path are drawn to Wayism. Wayism is not attractive to people who do not yet have the spiritual skills to fall head over heels in love with Wayism when they first encounter it. For this reason, a very small percentage of people are attracted to Wayism.
For millennia we congregated in secret chambers in monasteries and temples of the religions, or in hideaway caverns or under the guise of members-only secret organizations. Persecution was never far away for People of theWAY when World Orders and empires ruled, and when censorship and tyranny that hates when people think differently, prevail. Fortunately in these times, internet communities are still possible, so people from anywhere in the world can get together and share online.
Communities share jokes, interesting stories, fascinating new learnings about the miracles of nature, poems, workshops, courses, videos, prayers, meditations, music, and chitty-chat.
### Some of the key benefits of spiritual community and support include:
#### 1. Shared Experience and Understanding
By connecting with others who are also engaged in spiritual practice and study, individuals can share their experiences, insights, and challenges, and can receive validation, encouragement, and guidance from those who understand and relate to their journey. This shared experience can help to normalize the ups and downs of the spiritual path, and can provide a sense of camaraderie and connection that can be deeply sustaining and nourishing.
#### 2. Learning and Growth
Spiritual communities often offer a variety of teachings, practices, and resources that can support individuals in their learning and growth. By attending classes, workshops, retreats, or other events, individuals can deepen their understanding of the Wayist teachings and practices, and can receive guidance and instruction from experienced teachers and practitioners. This ongoing learning and growth can help to keep the practice fresh, engaging, and relevant to one's life and aspirations.
#### 3. Service and Contribution
Spiritual communities also provide opportunities for individuals to engage in service and contribution, both within the community and in the wider world. By volunteering, participating in community management or social justice initiatives, or simply offering one's presence and support to others, individuals can put their spiritual values and insights into action, and can contribute to the greater good in meaningful and impactful ways.
For example. At this time, teaching of theWAY is freely available. This freedom is always threatened. When it is not anymore freely available, a most senior deity must take an avatar body to come down and re-establish it again, as so many times before. But consider how long that darkness lasts before its freely available again to all people. What happened to Lord Jesus' message about theWAY and rebirth, loving-kindness and crestotes, and soul-people and spirit-people, soul-religions and spirituality, and our personal holy spirit, our guide, our Tara? And Lord Krishna's teaching of complete Yoga? It gets buried in schemes to capitalize on it. In Lord Jesus' example, it was obscured and adapted to serve the social engineering of the Roman Empire and their reign of terror and destruction all over the world, for many hundreds of years. It was used to "justify" the annihilation of other spiritualities--because the tithe was a worldwide tax on most people, not only Italians. And that is what happens every time the Truth is re-established, it takes a long time for the seeds to sprout and grow strong. What can we do to ensure the continued availability of the teaching? We all inherited this service opportunity. And what will we do when it again gets buried under another new world order's schemes? Well, who knows? Its been the cycle of how things flow when soul-people design schemes.
Service and contribution can be a powerful source of purpose, fulfillment, and spiritual growth.
#### 4. Accountability and Motivation
Being part of a spiritual community can also provide a sense of accountability and motivation for one's practice and growth. By committing to regular attendance, participation, and engagement with the community, individuals are more likely to stay consistent and dedicated to their practice, even in the face of challenges or obstacles. The support and encouragement of others can also be a powerful source of motivation and inspiration, particularly during times of difficulty or doubt.
#### 5. Celebration and Ritual
Spiritual communities often come together to celebrate important milestones, holidays, or events, and to engage in shared rituals and practices. These celebrations and rituals can be a powerful source of connection, joy, and meaning, and can help to anchor individuals in the larger context of their spiritual path and tradition. By participating in these shared experiences, individuals can deepen their sense of belonging, purpose, and connection to the divine.
### To benefit from the role of spiritual community and support, individuals can take a variety of steps, such as:
#### 1. Finding a Community
Join a community with the intention to contribute and participate. Don't judge Wayist spirituality by what lacks in a community, rather see any lack of activity as a cry for help, we need people to contribute to make it work. Western communities are accustomed to paying taxes so the government will take care of things. That is not how it is in the rest of the world --- we create our communities and we keep it clean and vibrant and disciplined and we plant the shrubs and trees. The percentage of devotees who come to a spiritual community to receive only, is always so large that in order to survive communities become businesses. Nobody wants that.
By setting up a designated space in your geographic location, virtual or physical, you can provide a platform for individuals with similar interests to come together and engage in meaningful interactions. It is worth noting that the majority of Wayist communities and workshops are not driven by profit, and as of now, none that we are aware of have any employees on their payroll but the founders. Their focus is not on selling you products or services, but rather on creating a platform where you can contribute and actively participate in building a community. In order for individuals who come from consumerist societies to fully comprehend Wayist communities, they must undergo a significant shift in mindset. It is important to understand that these communities lack both the resources and the inclination to organize extravagant, energy-intensive events centered around celebrities or highly polished services. Our main objective is to be authentic and genuine individuals who enjoy sharing with others who share similar interests.
You may not know it at this time, but over the past 5,000 years of our history, People of theWAY have never had a charismatic leader, never had large crowds gathered. And whenever someone tried to do it, it turned out to be fake and came to naught. We don't have, and never had, charismatic leaders with long beards, frocks and grand carriages, grand temples. We have well trained elders who ensure the veracity of training material, and that is what Wayism has always been. That said, we have been around in writing since the first writing in Mesopotamia, we have been the foundation upon which almost every religion wove their plush carpets, and of course the religions just came and went, came and went.
The only surviving Wayist temples from antiquity are ruins in northern India and what is now Pakistan and South Western China. Even those temples were tiny in comparison to what the religions had, and still have today. We have always been and always will be the smallest minority of students on Butterfly Path.
#### 2. Participating Regularly
Once you have found a community that feels like a good fit, commit to participating regularly in classes, events, and other offerings. Make an effort to get to know others in the community, and to offer your own presence, insights, and support as appropriate. Be the prop to sustain it when the community slumps, and enjoy the wave when the community is on a roll again.
#### 3. Volunteering and Serving
Look for opportunities to volunteer and serve within the community, whether through helping with events, moderating, creating material, managing, or simply offering your time and energy to support others. By giving of yourself in this way, you can deepen your own sense of purpose and connection, and can contribute to the greater good in meaningful ways.
#### 4. Seeking Guidance and Support
Don't hesitate to seek guidance and support from teachers, mentors, or other experienced practitioners within the community. These individuals can offer valuable insights, encouragement, and resources to support you on your path. They can help you navigate the challenges and opportunities of spiritual growth with greater ease and grace.
It's important to understand that because religious traditions often have built-in ways to financially support their organizations, they frequently have teams dedicated to recruiting new members by offering free books, counseling, support, and other resources. In contrast, Wayists typically do not provide such services for free. Healing, counseling, seminars and other offerings are usually fee-based, as Wayist teachers and practitioners need to make a living just like grocers, doctors and pharmacists do.
One key difference is that Wayist teachers generally do not derive ego gratification from their roles as spiritual guides. As a result, students should not necessarily expect them to dedicate extensive personal time and energy, especially for free. The recommendation is to heed the advice offered, diligently apply the teachings, do your own part, and continue the dialogue with your teacher as you progress. Spiritual development in Wayism is a collaboration that requires effort and responsibility from both student and guide.
By engaging with a spiritual community and support in these ways, individuals can deepen their own practice and understanding, while also contributing to the collective wisdom and well-being of the larger community. Through this ongoing exchange of learning, service, and support, individuals can cultivate a sense of belonging, purpose, and connection that can sustain and nourish them throughout their spiritual journey.
Ultimately, the role of spiritual community and support is to create a sacred container for the unfolding of each individual's unique path and potential, while also fostering a sense of unity, compassion, and service that extends beyond the boundaries of the community itself. By participating in this larger web of connection and support, individuals can access the wisdom, guidance, and inspiration needed to navigate the complexities of the soul-growth and personal development path with greater ease, clarity, and purpose, and can contribute to the awakening and healing of all beings.
Chapter 10
## Poetic Expressions
### Divine Love in Mystical Poetry
Throughout history, mystics and poets from various spiritual traditions have sought to capture the profound and transformative experience of divine love through their words. These poetic expressions often employ passionate, romantic imagery to convey the soul's intense yearning for union with the divine, transcending the boundaries of religion, caste, and social conventions.
One significant turning point in the history of mystical poetry occurred during the 1st Century when the deity known in Sanskrit as Lord Avalok-isvara (Avalokiteshvara), who had on occasion taken human bodies and lived as avatar among us in the form of several historic personages, Lord Jesus and Lord Krishna among others, declared in the Lotus Sutra, that he and heaven's Taras would make themselves available for direct communication with all people. This truly revolutionary idea challenged the prevailing notion that only priests and monks could intercede between the divine and the common people, often in exchange for donations to religious institutions.
Avalokiteshvara's message was one of inclusivity and accessibility, stating that he would appear to devotees in the form most suitable for them, whether as a woman, a man, or any of the gods of their culture. This declaration resonated deeply with people from all walks of life, particularly those who had been marginalized by traditional religious hierarchies, such as women and those considered "untouchable" in Hindu society. This was the heyday of Theravada Buddhism and some forms of Hinduism in which it was believed that women cannot go to heaven, cannot get enlightenment, and should not enter the holiest temple spaces.
The idea that all individuals, no matter their caste or gender, could approach the divine directly, expressing their love and devotion without intermediaries, sparked a flourishing of mystical poetry in various languages and traditions. Home shrines and town shrines jumped up all over the Eastern worlds. Women, in particular, found in poetry and songs a means of emotional sustenance and a way to express their pure devotion to the divine, even as they faced societal oppression and exclusion.
One such poet was Mirabai, a 16th century Hindu mystic who composed passionate verses expressing her longing for union with Lord Krishna. In her poem "The Heat of Midnight Tears," Mirabai employs sensual imagery to convey the intensity of her devotion, comparing the path to God to a "road of the heart opening" and describing the "tears all night" shed in her lovers-quest for the divine.
Similarly, the 13th century poet Janabai fearlessly challenged social conventions in her pursuit of spiritual union. In her poem "Cast off All Shame," Janabai describes herself as a "slut", as that is how society branded her, who enters the crowded marketplace, cymbals, and veena (which are music instruments, reserved for low-caste street musicians), in hand, and the slip of her sari falling away (because she did not have a free hand to pull it up), but she does not care to stop her devotional song before the townsfolk could slander her. All in the name of discoursing with her Lord. Her words reflect the courage and single-minded devotion of a woman willing to face societal judgment in order to live her love for the divine.
Matrimonial mysticism refers to the phenomenon in which so many mystics "married" their Divine Tara. In western traditions it was most common among women. It also occurred in cultures that embrace multiple spouses in a marriage.
Lalleshwari, a 14th century Kashmiri mystic, also defied social norms in her pursuit of spiritual realization. In her poems, she celebrates the freedom and beauty of a life dedicated to the divine, even as she faces criticism and abuse from those around her. She was a homeless hermit and had to wash in the lake, and someone slandered her for having seen her naked, she wrote the poem, "Dance, Lalla, with nothing on but air," she writes, "Sing, Lalla, wearing the sky." Her words evoke a sense of joyful abandon and a deep connection to the natural world as a manifestation of the divine.
The tradition of mystical love poetry extends beyond Hinduism, finding expression in the works of Sufi poets like Rumi and Kabir, as well as Christian mystics like Catherine of Siena and Teresa of Avilla. These poets employ similar imagery of the soul as a lover seeking union with the divine beloved, often using sensual metaphors to convey the intensity of their yearning.
Kabir, a 15th century Hindu and Muslim mystic, writes of his body being "flooded with the flame of Love" and his soul living in a "furnace of bliss." He urges his listeners to "lift the veil that obscures the heart" in order to find what they are truly seeking. Similarly, Rumi, the renowned 13th century Persian poet, frequently employs the metaphor of drunkenness to describe the intoxicating nature of that wine of divine love, as in his famous line: "I am so drunk on the wine of Love, I have lost the way to my house."
These poetic expressions of divine love, spanning centuries and traditions, share a common thread: the recognition that the path to spiritual realization is one of intense devotion, surrender, and a willingness to transcend societal conventions and expectations. By giving voice to their longing for union with the divine, these mystic poets have inspired countless seekers across time and space, reminding us of the transformative power of love in its highest, most sacred form.
Wayism is the higher-self spirituality to which all students on Butterfly Path mature. No matter the religious frame within which a person must walk because of forced convention, all awaken to the same spiritual awakening, which we call Butterfly Path. They may not know the name we use, but they all awaken to the exact same principles of the higher-self spirituality that takes us Home.
When you walk in theWAY with us, you walk with the Sufi masters, the Rabia al Basra's of the world, the Kabirs, the Janabais and Lalleshwaris, the Gnostic seers and Hindu masters, the Jain sages and Christian mystics, the Sumerian sages and sisters of Isis, Lord Jesus and Lord Krishna, and countless others all of whom awakened to same --- who are all headed to live their immortality in the hallowed halls of our Heaven alongside the buddhas, gods, angels, deva, and devata as the various cultures named them. We have this life as a gift from the Divine, as an opportunity to evolve our souls to that degree.
Rabia Basri (8th c.) wrote in her Dream Fable:
*I saw myself in a wide green garden, more beautiful than I could begin to understand. In this garden was a young girl. I said to her, "How wonderful this place is!"*
**
*"Would you like to see a place even more wonderful than this?" she asked.*
**
*"Oh yes," I answered. Then taking me by the hand, she led me on until we came to a magnificent palace, like nothing that was ever seen by human eyes. The young girl knocked on the door, and someone opened it. Immediately both of us were flooded with light.*
**
*Only the God knows the inner meaning of the maidens we saw living there. Each one carried in her hand a serving-tray filled with light. The young girl asked the maidens where they were going, and they answered her, "We are looking for someone who was drowned in the sea, and so became a martyr. She never slept at night, not one wink! We are going to rub funeral spices on her body."*
**
*"Then rub some on my friend here," the young girl said.*
**
*"Once upon a time," said the maidens, "part of this spice and the fragrance of it clung to her body --- but then she shied away."*
**
**
*Quickly the young girl let go of my hand, turned, and said to me:*
**
*"Your prayers are your light;*
**
*Your devotion is your strength;*
**
*Sleep is the enemy of both.*
**
*Your life is the only opportunity that life can give you.*
**
*If you ignore it, if you waste it,*
**
*You will only turn to dust."*
**
*Then the young girl disappeared. *
As we explore these poetic expressions of divine love, we are invited to reflect on our own yearning for connection with the transcendent, to embrace the passion and surrender that characterize the mystic's path.
In a world that often feels divided and disconnected, these poems offer a timeless reminder of the unity and love that lie at the heart of all spiritual traditions, beckoning us to cast off our shame, dance with abandon, and open our hearts to the all-consuming love of the divine.
#### *The Heat of Midnight Tears*
*Listen, my friend, this road is the heart opening,*
*Kissing his feet, resistance broken, tears all night.*
*If we could reach the Lord through immersion in water,*
*I would have asked to be born a fish in this life.*
*If we could reach Him through nothing but berries and wild nuts,*
*Then surely the saints would have been monkeys when they came from the womb!*
*If we could reach him by munching lettuce and dry leaves,*
*Then the goats would surely go to the Holy One before us!*
*If the worship of stone statues could bring us all the way,*
*I would have adored a granite mountain years ago.*
*Mirabai says: The heat of midnight tears will bring you to God.*
*~ Mirabai*
#### *Cast off All Shame *
*Cast off all shame,*
*and sell yourself*
*in the marketplace;*
*then alone*
*can you hope*
*to reach the Lord.*
*Cymbals in hand,*
*a veena upon my shoulder,*
*I go about;*
*who dares to stop me?*
*The pallav of my sari*
*falls away (A scandal!);*
*yet will I enter*
*the crowded marketplace*
*without a thought.*
*Jani says, My Lord*
*I have become a slut*
*to reach your home.*
*~ Janabai*
#### *Dance, Lalla*
****
****
*Dance, Lalla, with nothing on*
*but air. *
*Sing, Lalla, wearing *
*the sky.*
*Look at this glowing day! *
*What clothes*
*could be so beautiful, *
*or more sacred?*
*~ Lalleshwari*
#### *I am indifferent to praise and blame *
*They may abuse me or jeer at me,*
*They may say what pleases them,*
*They may with flowers worship me.*

*What profits them whatever they do?*
*I am indifferent to praise and blame.*
*~ Lalleshwari*
At one time, Lalla was in love with her teacher. Regarding worldly love for a worldly lover, Lalla wrote:
*Why do you dote upon someone, my Soul, *
*who is not your true love? *
*Why have you taken the false for the true? *
*Why can't you understand, why can't you know? *
**
*It is ignorance that binds you to the false, *
*To the ever-recurring wheel of birth and death, *
*...this coming and going.*
*~ Lalleshwari*
#### *I will weep for you, oh mind*
*I will weep and weep for you, O Mind;*
*My Soul, the world hath caught you in its spell.*
**
*Though you cling to them with the anchor of steel,*
*Not even the shadow of the things you love*
*Will go with you when you are dead.*
**
*Why then have you forgot your own spirit Self ?*

## The Transformative Power
### of Wayist Mystical Practice
### Personal Growth and Self-Discovery through Wayist Practices
The Wayist spiritual path is a powerful catalyst for personal growth and self-discovery, offering a range of practices, teachings, and experiences that can help individuals to cultivate greater self-awareness, wisdom, and compassion.
By engaging with these practices consistently and wholeheartedly, individuals can undergo a profound process of transformation, shedding limiting beliefs, patterns, and identities, and awakening their spiritual nature as radiant expressions of the divine.
#### Some of the key areas of personal growth and self-discovery that can be supported through Wayist practices include:
#### ~ Self-Awareness
Through practices such as meditation, self-inquiry, and reflection, individuals can cultivate a deeper understanding of their own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, and can begin to identify the underlying beliefs, assumptions, and conditioning that shape their experience of reality. This self-awareness can be a powerful tool for personal growth, as it allows individuals to make more conscious and intentional choices about how they want to show up in the world.
#### ~ Emotional Intelligence
Wayist practices such as loving-kindness meditation, compassion cultivation, gratitude, and forgiveness can help individuals to develop greater emotional intelligence and resilience. By learning to use the immense power of Attitude to change and manage our energies, we become specialist emotional energy workers and healers of self and others. By learning to work skillfully with difficult emotions such as anger, fear, or grief, individuals can cultivate greater equanimity, empathy, and self-compassion, and can respond to life's challenges with greater wisdom and grace.
#### ~ Spiritual Insight
Through practices such as Divine Tarayoga, Karman Active Meditation, and mystiception, individuals can access profound states of spiritual insight and revelation, gaining a deeper understanding of the nature of reality, the self, and the divine. These insights can be transformative, helping individuals to let go of limiting beliefs and identities, and to align their lives with a greater sense of purpose and meaning.
#### ~ Relationship Skills
Wayist teachings emphasize the importance of cultivating harmonious and compassionate relationships, both with oneself and with others. By practicing qualities such as empathy, active listening, and non-violent communication, individuals can develop greater skill in navigating interpersonal challenges and conflicts, and can create more fulfilling and supportive relationships in all areas of life.
#### ~ Creativity and Self-Expression
Wayist practices can also support individuals in tapping into their innate creativity and self-expression, helping them to discover and share their unique gifts and talents with the world. Through practices such as art, music, dance, or writing, individuals can explore new dimensions of their being, and can cultivate a greater sense of joy, purpose, and fulfillment in their lives.
### To support personal growth and self-discovery through Wayist practices, individuals can take a variety of steps, such as:
#### 1. Cultivating a Regular Practice
As discussed earlier, developing a regular and consistent practice of meditation, prayer, and other spiritual disciplines is essential for personal growth and transformation. By setting aside dedicated time each day for these practices, individuals can create the conditions for deeper insight, healing, and awakening to occur.
#### 2. Seeking Guidance and Support
Working with experienced teachers, mentors, or spiritual counselors can be a valuable source of guidance and support for personal growth and self-discovery. These individuals can offer personalized insights, practices, and resources to support individuals in their unique journey of transformation.
#### 3. Engaging in Self-Reflection
Taking time to reflect on one's experiences, insights, and challenges through journaling, contemplation, or dialogue with others can be a powerful tool for self-discovery and growth. By examining one's patterns, beliefs, and assumptions with honesty and compassion, individuals can gain greater clarity and understanding of themselves and their path.
#### 4. Applying Insights to Daily Life
The ultimate test of personal growth and self-discovery is how it is applied and integrated into daily life. By bringing the qualities of mindfulness, compassion, and wisdom cultivated through Wayist practices into one's relationships, work, and other areas of life, individuals can create a more authentic and fulfilling way of being in the world.
Ultimately, the transformative power of Wayist spirituality lies in its ability to help individuals awaken to their true nature as radiant expressions of the divine, and to align their lives with the highest principles of love, wisdom, and service. By engaging wholeheartedly with these practices and teachings, individuals can undergo a profound process of personal growth and self-discovery, shedding the limitations and illusions of the ego, and embracing the boundless potential of their true being.
Through this process of transformation, individuals can not only experience greater joy, meaning, and fulfillment in their own lives, but can also become powerful agents of change and healing in the world, contributing to the awakening and upliftment of all beings. By embodying the qualities of compassion, wisdom, and service in all that they do, individuals can create a ripple effect of positive transformation that extends far beyond their own personal journey, touching the lives of countless others and helping to create a more just, loving, and awakened world.
## 11.1 Cultivating Compassion, Wisdom, and Chrestotes
At the heart of Wayist spirituality is the cultivation of the spiritual skill of chrestotes, which is compassion, and the wisdom of wisdom, of helpful loving-kindness --- a quality that are seen as the highest expressions of our spiritual nature, and the key to experiencing greater peace, happiness, and fulfillment in all areas of life. By dedicating ourselves to the practice and embodiment of chrestotes, we can not only transform our own lives, but can also contribute to the healing and awakening of others.
Compassion, in the Wayist tradition, is the ability to empathize with the suffering of others and chrestotes is the wisdom to respond with the right kind of help, at the right time, without interfering in another's karma but showing kindness and validation. It is rooted in the recognition of our fundamental interconnectedness --- the understanding that the wellbeing of others is inseparable from our own, and that by caring for others, we are also caring for ourselves.
Cultivating chrestotes involves a range of practices and approaches, but mainly to respond with skillful action and wise discernment. Most of the time acknowledgement of another who is having a hard time, or doing a menial job, is chrestotes. Sometimes a nod of the head, or just holding a door, a look in the eye, or carrying a bag, is chrestotes. Often, allowing someone to suffer the consequence of bad decisions but being kind nonetheless is chrestotes. Often, to not step in and shield someone from a karmic lesson but just being there as support is chrestotes. Through these practices, we learn to open our hearts to the suffering of others, to hold that suffering with tenderness and care, and to respond with skillful action and wise discernment.
As we deepen in our practice of chrestotes, we may find that our capacity for empathy, understanding self and others, and forgiveness expands. We may become more attuned to the subtle ways in which we contribute to the suffering of others through our thoughts, words, and actions, and more committed to aligning our lives with the principles of non-harm and non-violence.
Wisdom, in the Wayist tradition, refers to the direct and intuitive understanding of the nature of reality, the self, and the path to graduation. It is not merely an intellectual or conceptual understanding, but a deep and embodied knowing that arises from the practice of living life fully and deeply, self-inquiry, and spiritual discernment.
Through these and our mystical spirituality practices, we learn to investigate the nature of our own experience with curiosity, openness, and discernment, and to see through the illusions and distortions of the ego-minds.
As we deepen in our practice of wisdom, we may find that our understanding of reality becomes more clear, spacious, and luminous. We may experience profound insights into the impermanent, interdependent, and empty nature of all phenomena, and may begin to let go of our attachment to fixed identities, beliefs, and concepts.
Simplicity, Humility, and Chrestotes in the Wayist tradition, is the highest expression of our spiritual nature -- the boundless, all-embracing love that is the very essence of the divine. It is a love that is not dependent on external conditions or circumstances, but arises spontaneously from the depth of our being, and extends to all beings without exception.
Cultivating Simplicity, Humility, and Chrestotes involves a range of practices and approaches, such as Divine Tarayoga, devotional prayer, and acts of selfless service. Through these practices, we learn to open our hearts to the infinite love and wisdom of the divine, and to allow that love to flow through us in all of our thoughts, words, and actions.
As we deepen in our practice of mystical spirituality, we may find that our capacity for acceptance, forgiveness, and kindness expands, both for ourselves and for others.
Ultimately, the cultivation of Simplicity, Humility, and Chrestotes is a lifelong journey --- one that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to embrace the challenges and opportunities of the path. By dedicating ourselves to these practices with sincerity, humility, and an open heart, we can gradually transform our lives and our world, and can become ever more radiant expressions of the divine love and wisdom that is our spiritual nature.
As we cultivate these qualities in ourselves, we may find that we naturally begin to embody them in our relationships, our work, and our service to the world. We may find that we are more able to navigate the challenges and complexities of life with greater ease, resilience, and grace, and that we are more able to contribute to the greater good in meaningful and impactful ways.
Ultimately, the cultivation of Simplicity, Humility, and Chrestotes is not a solitary journey, but one that is deeply interconnected with the wellbeing and awakening of all beings. By dedicating ourselves to these practices, we are not only transforming ourselves, but are also contributing to the collective healing and evolution of our world.
By embodying these qualities in all that we do, we can create a powerful ripple effect of positive change and transformation, one that extends far beyond our own personal lives and touches the lives of countless others. We can become beacons of hope and inspiration for others, demonstrating the transformative power of these practices, and encouraging others to follow the path of awakening and service.
Ultimately, the cultivation of Simplicity, Humility, and Chrestotes is the heart of the Wayist path -- the key to realizing our full potential as spiritual beings, and to creating a world that reflects the highest values of love, wisdom, and unity. By dedicating ourselves to these practices with sincerity, humility, and an open heart, we can transform ourselves and our community, and can become ever more radiant expressions of the divine truth and love that is our true nature.
May all junior students on the Path awaken to the infinite love and wisdom that is their birthright, and may all beings discover Simplicity, Humility, and Chrestotes, in awakening their spiritual potential. May the practices of Simplicity, Humility, and Chrestotes continue to guide and inspire us on the path of awakening, now and always.
May it so be.
## 11.2 Embracing Authenticity and Simplicity in Wayist Spirituality
In the Wayist tradition, the practice of Udbhu-kanti extends beyond material possessions and encompasses a deep appreciation for the natural world and the importance of cultivating a sustainable and harmonious relationship with the environment. Wayists are encouraged to grow fruit trees and vegetable gardens, even in apartments where they can plant herbs and sprout seeds. Homes with yard space are encouraged to keep a few laying hens for eggs and to breed rabbits, as these animals can help to create a sustainable ecosystem by eating table scraps and providing natural fertilizer for the garden.
Wayists believe that all unused table scraps should go back into the soil, as the soil requires more than just inorganic fertilizers to thrive. They recognize that the overuse of chemical fertilizers in agriculture has led to the depletion of soil and the poisoning of water sources worldwide. By embracing natural, organic soil that is alive with a diverse array of nutrients and organisms, Wayists believe that we can cultivate healthier food and promote the well-being of both humans and the environment.
The practice of Udbhu-kanti also extends to the treatment of animals raised for food. Wayists believe that it should be a crime to keep animals in cages and not provide them with opportunities for a natural existence. Even pets should be allowed to live a natural life and not be confined to a leash or kept indoors permanently. Wayists believe that all beings deserve to live in harmony with their natural instincts and that we have a responsibility to treat them with respect and compassion.
In addition to cultivating a sustainable relationship with the environment, the practice of Udbhu-kanti also emphasizes the importance of rest and restoration. Wayists believe that the earth, people, and the environment must have time to rest and recover from the demands of modern life. Declare Planet Rest Days. To promote this, they advocate for shutting down all non-essential industries and jobs from Saturday afternoon until Monday morning, allowing for a day and a half of rest and rejuvenation.
During this time, people are encouraged to engage in activities that promote community and connection, such as repairing household items, tending to household plants, tending to neighborhood plants, sharing fruits and vegetables with neighbors, and allowing children to play freely in communal green spaces. Wayists believe that by returning to these wholesome ways and prioritizing rest and restoration, we can promote the well-being of both individuals and communities.
By shutting down all industry and jobs except for essential workers for a day and a half each week, we drop the generated air pollution by 15%. Additionally, declare one month a year, Slow Month. Businesses close for the month, or run half the hours, people take their holidays, some industries like construction, mining, manufacturing, education, anything except for government--they don't work enough as is, shut down or slow down. For the small number of people who choose to hold the belief that CO^2^ is a pollutant, this is the best way to go about resolving your problem. Make your Planet Rest Days a tree-planting exercise, which also gets you out into nature.
But don't ask economists about Udbhu-kanti because they will tell you all about the loss of taxes and fiscal balances that benefit only the investments of the super-wealthy. They weigh those interest as more important than the wholesomeness of the planet and society. Don't expect the Climate Crisis religion to agree to something as simple as this, it does not advance their true agenda.
Those who usher in new world orders, as they have been doing forever throughout human history, consider us as enemies because we strive toward self-sufficient communities. Wayists have the psychological means, life-skills, and spirituality to survive the hardships created to make people compliant and grateful for the little gifts of personal freedoms and cash handouts from the control systems. We have savings and little unfulfilled desires for stuff. We are not the people they need to make their systems work.
The practice of Udbhu-kanti also emphasizes the importance of education and the cultivation of basic human skills. Wayists believe that schools should teach children about gardening, food cultivation and preservation, and the importance of soil and nutrition. They also believe that homeless people should be given the opportunity to work in community gardens, as this can help to instill a sense of self-worth and contribution to the community. It is important to provide prisoners in jail with the opportunity to cultivate food, produce clothing, and construct or repair furniture for the penal system.
Ultimately, the practice of Udbhu-kanti serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of living with intention, mindfulness, and a profound respect for the beauty found in simplicity and authenticity. By embracing this philosophy, Wayists embark on a journey of self-discovery and spiritual growth, learning to find happiness and fulfillment in the things that truly matter. They cultivate a deep connection with the natural world and recognize the inherent value in all living beings, striving to live in harmony with the earth and with each other. In a world that often prioritizes consumerism and the pursuit of novelty, the practice of Udbhu-kanti offers a path towards a more sustainable, compassionate, and fulfilling way of life.
## 11.3 The Ongoing Journey of Spiritual Evolution
The Wayist path of spiritual growth and transformation is not a destination that can be reached in a single lifetime, but an ongoing journey of evolution and awakening that spans countless lifetimes and beyond. You have evidently been working on it for a very long time. This understanding is reflected in the Butterfly Path, the central metaphor of Wayist spirituality, which describes the soul's journey from the caterpillar's life in the underbrush of ignorance and suffering to cocoon of awakening and transformation, to the liberation and birth of the spiritual being.
According to Wayist teachings, the soul's journey begins in the realm of matter, where it is bound by the limitations and illusions of the physical world. Through the process of reincarnation, the soul gradually awakens to its future nature as an eternal spiritual being, shedding the layers of conditioning and karma that obscure its innate wisdom and compassion.
As the soul progresses along the Butterfly Path, it passes through various stages of spiritual evolution and awakenings, each with its own challenges and opportunities for growth and transformation. These stages are often likened to the metamorphosis of a butterfly, from the egg to the caterpillar and its many moltings of old self, to the chrysalis to the fully realized butterfly.
In the early stages of the journey, the soul may be primarily focused on its own survival and gratification, genetic group affiliations and seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in the realm of the senses. As it begins to awaken to the deeper dimensions of reality, however, it may begin to question the meaning and purpose of its existence, and to seek answers through spiritual practice and inquiry.
As the soul deepens in its practice and understanding, it may begin to experience profound states of insight, deep sadness for the despair in the world of caterpillars, anger at the deceit and abuse, compassion, and kindness, as well as a growing sense of unity and interconnectedness with all of life. It may also begin to recognize the impermanent, interdependent, and empty nature of all phenomena, and to let go of its attachment to fixed identities, beliefs, and concepts. This is a very confusing and heartbreaking phase of being in the human condition.
At the same time, the soul may also encounter various obstacles and challenges along the way, such as doubt, fear, or resistance to change. These obstacles can serve as valuable opportunities for growth and transformation, however, helping the soul to develop greater resilience, wisdom, and compassion in the face of adversity.
Ultimately, the goal of the Butterfly Path is not simply to attain a state of personal liberation or enlightenment, but to awaken to the fundamental unity and interdependence of all life, and to dedicate oneself to co-existing and helpfulness with all living beings.
As the soul progresses along the Butterfly Path, it may begin to experience a growing sense of purpose and meaning in its existence, as well as a deep desire to contribute to the healing and awakening of others. It may feel called to use its unique gifts and talents in service of the greater good, whether through spiritual practice, social activism, or simply being a force for compassion and wisdom in the world.
At the same time, the soul may also begin to recognize that the journey of spiritual evolution is not a solitary one, but a collective endeavor that involves all beings. It may feel a growing sense of connection and solidarity with others who are also walking the path of awakening, and may seek out opportunities for spiritual community, support, and collaboration.
Ultimately, the ongoing journey of spiritual evolution is a path of endless discovery, growth, and transformation --- one that requires patience, perseverance, and a deep commitment to the wellbeing of all. By dedicating ourselves to this path with sincerity, humility, and an open heart, we can become ever more radiant expressions of the divine love and wisdom that is our true nature, and can contribute to the collective awakening and healing of all on the Path.
As we walk this path together, may we always remember the words of Teacher Yusa the great Wayist teacher, who said:
"The Butterfly Path is not a path that can be walked alone, but a path that requires the community of all humans and living beings, and the support and guidance of deities. As we journey together, may we always extend chrestotes and the wisdom of theWAY to those who are struggling, and may we always be open to receiving the same from others. May we never forget that our own graduation is inseparable from the school that consists of all grades of students and living beings of all species, and may we dedicate ourselves to this highest aspiration with all of our heart, all of our soul, and all of our spirit. May the blessings of the Divine be with us always, guiding and sustaining us on this sacred journey of awakening and service. Om Mani Padme Hum."

## Applying the Tapestry Analogy to Wayist Practices
Understanding the analogy of the cosmic tapestry introduced in the Introduction to this book, provides a powerful framework for Wayist spiritual practices. Let's explore how the analogy can deepen our approach to key aspects of the Wayist path:
### Divine Tarayoga and the Master Weavers
In the tapestry of existence, Divine Taras can be seen as master weavers who have achieved perfect harmony with all layers of the cosmic design. They possess the ability to perceive and manipulate threads across all three energy domains with unparalleled skill and wisdom.
When we engage in Divine Tarayoga, we are essentially apprenticing ourselves to these master weavers. Through this practice:
-   We learn to attune our perception to the finer threads of the Soul and Spiritual domains.
-   Our Divine Taras guide our hands, teaching us how to weave our individual threads more skillfully.
-   We begin to see how our personal patterns connect to the greater design of the tapestry.
As we deepen our practice of Divine Tarayoga, we may experience moments where we seem to see through the eyes of our Tara, gaining profound insights into the nature of reality and our place within it.
### Prayer and Intention Setting
Prayer, in the context of the cosmic tapestry, can be understood as a way of sending intentional vibrations through our thread, influencing the patterns around us. When we pray:
-   We create ripples in the tapestry, affecting not only the visible threads of the Material domain but also the subtler threads of the Soul and Spiritual domains.
-   Our intentions, infused with the energy of the heart (Anahata), can attract similar vibrations, creating beautiful, harmonious patterns in the tapestry.
-   Consistent prayer practice strengthens our connection to the finer threads, making us more receptive to guidance and spiritual insights.
### Meditation and the Art of Seeing
Meditation, in this framework, becomes the practice of refining our ability to perceive and interact with the different layers of the tapestry. Through regular meditation:
-   We learn to quiet the constant movement of the visible threads (Material domain), allowing us to perceive the subtler layers.
-   We develop the ability to focus on specific patterns or areas of the tapestry, gaining deeper insights into the nature of reality.
-   We may experience moments of expanded awareness, where we perceive vast sections of the tapestry simultaneously, understanding the interconnectedness of all things.
### Karman Active Meditation
Karman Active Meditation can be seen as a dynamic way of weaving our thread through all layers of the tapestry. As we move through the fourteen sacred postures:
-   We actively engage with the visible threads of the Material domain through physical movement.
-   We attune to the shimmering threads of the Soul domain through breath work and emotional awareness.
-   We reach for the luminescent threads of the Spiritual domain through intention and spiritual focus.
This practice helps us integrate all aspects of our being, creating a more harmonious and balanced pattern in our section of the tapestry.
### Mystiception and Tapestry Exploration
Practicing mystiception can be compared to embarking on guided journeys through the deeper layers of the tapestry. During these experiences:
-   We may perceive patterns and connections that are normally hidden from view.
-   We might encounter other beings or energies represented by different threads or patterns in the tapestry.
-   We can receive profound insights about the nature of reality and our role in the grand design.
These experiences, while often ineffable, can significantly accelerate our spiritual growth and our ability to navigate the tapestry consciously.
### The Butterfly Path and Thread Transformation
The Butterfly Path, central to Wayist teaching, can be beautifully illustrated through the tapestry analogy:
-   The caterpillar stage represents our thread when it's primarily visible and thick, deeply embedded in the Material domain.
-   The chrysalis stage is a period of intense transformation, where our thread begins to incorporate more of the shimmering (Soul) and luminescent (Spiritual) qualities.
-   The butterfly stage represents our thread when it has become fine and radiant, capable of weaving intricate patterns that span all three domains.
This transformation is not instantaneous but occurs gradually through consistent spiritual practice and life experiences.
### Chrestotes and Tapestry Care
The practice of chrestotes, or helpful loving-kindness, can be seen as a way of caring for and maintaining the tapestry:
-   When we act with chrestotes, we send harmonious vibrations through our thread, creating beautiful patterns that positively influence surrounding areas.
-   By helping others, we're essentially assisting them in untangling knots or smoothing out rough areas in their section of the tapestry.
-   Consistent practice of chrestotes contributes to the overall health and beauty of the cosmic tapestry.
### In Sum
By viewing Wayist practices through the lens of the cosmic tapestry, we gain a deeper understanding of their significance and effects. We see how each practice contributes to our ability to perceive, navigate, and consciously participate in the weaving of existence.
As we progress on our spiritual journey, we become increasingly skilled at working with all layers of the tapestry. We learn to create more beautiful and harmonious patterns, not just in our individual section, but in the greater design. This is the essence of spiritual growth and service in the Wayist tradition.
Remember, every thought, every action, every moment of awareness is an opportunity to weave more skillfully, to align more closely with the divine pattern, and to contribute to the beauty and harmony of the cosmic tapestry. As you engage in your spiritual practices, hold this image in mind, and allow it to inspire and guide your journey on the Butterfly Path.

## Conclusion
### Recap of Key Insights and Teachings
As we near the conclusion of our exploration of Wayist spirituality and the transformative practices of prayer, meditation, and mystiception, it is valuable to pause and reflect on the pivotal insights and teachings that have emerged during this process.
At the heart of Wayist spirituality is the understanding that we are becoming immortal spiritual beings, forever connected to the divine Source of all life, which is also referred to as Universal Energy, forever serving soul-beings from our home in Sukhavati heaven under guidance of deities and God our father and God our Mother in Heaven.
Through the practices of prayer, meditation, and mystiception, we can cultivate a direct and intimate relationship with the divine presence of energies from our heaven and its multitude of divine beings, and can awaken to our true nature as radiant expressions of Chrestotes, Humbleness, and Simplicity.
We have seen how prayer can serve as a powerful tool for self-reflection, self-discovery, and self-transformation, allowing us to explore the depths of our own being and to align ourselves with the highest truth and purpose of our lives. Through the practice of gratitude, surrender, and devotion, we can open ourselves to the infinite blessings and guidance of the divine, and can experience a profound sense of connection, meaning, and fulfillment.
We have also explored the transformative power of mystical connections and how it can help us cultivate greater clarity, insight, and inner peace amid life's challenges and distractions. By learning to still the mind and align our consciousness with the divine, we can tap into the infinite wellspring of wisdom and compassion that flows from heaven into our essence, and can experience a profound sense of unity and interconnectedness with all of life.
Through the practice of mystiception, we have discovered how to cultivate a direct and intimate experience of divine connection and spiritual awareness, one that transcends the limitations of ordinary consciousness and opens us to the infinite possibilities of growth and transformation. By attuning ourselves to the subtle dimensions of reality and the guidance of our Divine Tara, we can navigate the challenges of the spiritual path with greater ease and grace, and can become powerful agents of healing and awakening in the world.
We have also explored the profound stages of devotional mystical experience, from the pivotal point of the Theopathic Nexus to the ultimate heights of Theopathic Communion. By cultivating a deep and abiding relationship with the divine through practices such as Divine Tarayoga and Karman Active Meditation, we can open ourselves to the most profound and transformative experiences of spiritual realization and awakening.
We learned about Udbhu-kanti, the Wayist practice that encourages a life of simplicity, authenticity, and harmony with the natural world. By embracing the principle of "*knowing your enough,*" cultivating sustainable relationships with the environment, and prioritizing rest and restoration, Wayists seek to find contentment and spiritual growth. Through the practice of Udbhu-kanti, individuals embark on a journey of self-discovery, learning to appreciate the beauty in simplicity and to live in alignment with their values and the well-being of all living beings.
Finally, we have seen how the cultivation of Humbleness, Simplicity, and Chrestotes (Helpful Loving-kindness) lies at the heart of the Wayist path, and how these qualities can transform not only our own lives but the lives of all beings. By dedicating ourselves to generating powerful positive energies we serve the greater good and the awakening of all juniors on the Path, we can create a powerful ripple effect of positive change and healing in our world, and can contribute to the collective evolution of spiritual awareness and the realization of our highest potential as spiritual beings.
### Encouragement for Continued Practice and Growth
As we come to the end of this exploration of Wayist spirituality and the practices of prayer, meditation, and mystiception, it is important to remember that the journey of spiritual growth and transformation is ongoing, requiring patience, perseverance, and a deep commitment to the path.
While the insights and experiences that we have explored in these pages can be profoundly transformative, they are not ends in themselves, but signposts and invitations to deeper levels of practice and realization. The true power of these teachings lies not in the words themselves, but in how we embody and integrate them into our daily lives.
As such, I encourage you to continue to deepen your own practice and understanding of these transformative practices, and to approach the journey of spiritual growth with a sense of curiosity, openness, and devotion. Avail yourself of other Wayist lifestyle materials that will help you take charge of your life and direct your energies to wholesomeness for all in your circle. Remember that every moment, every breath, every challenge, and opportunity that arises in your life is an invitation to awaken to your true nature and to align yourself with the highest truth and purpose of your being.
Whether you are just beginning your spiritual journey or have been walking the path for many years in this lifetime, know that you are not alone in this endeavor. The Wayist tradition is a living and evolving community in the West, of practitioners and seekers all dedicated to the realization of our highest potential as spiritual beings and to the service of all life.
As you continue to deepen your practice and understanding, I encourage you to seek the support and guidance of experienced teachers, mentors, and spiritual friends, and to take part in the life of the Wayist community. By connecting with others who share your aspirations and values, you can deepen your own practice and understanding, and can contribute to the collective's wellbeing.
Remember that the ultimate authority and guide on your spiritual journey is your own inner wisdom and intuition. While the ancient Wayist teachings form the foundation of truth for you to work from and fall back on, every sojourner is at their own level. Trust in the guidance and support of your Divine Tara, and listen deeply to the whispers of your own soul and the ecstasies of your developing spirit. Know that every step of the journey, every challenge, and opportunity that arises, is a sacred invitation to grow, heal, and awaken to your true nature.
Above all, approach the journey of spiritual growth and transformation with a sense of joy, wonder, and gratitude. Remember that the very fact of your existence is a miracle and a blessing, and that every moment is an opportunity to experience the infinite love and wisdom that is your birthright as a spiritual being.
May the practices and teachings of Wayist spirituality continue to guide and inspire you on your journey of awakening and wholesomeness, and may you always walk in the divine's light, truth, and love that dwell within you.
#### Parting words:
Before we part ways for now, let us ponder the magnificent tapestry of the universe and the remarkable opportunity that the Butterfly Path presents. Imagine, if you will, that the vast universe as you understand it is akin to the majestic Pacific Ocean. Now, envision the other oceans as unknown energy dimensions, interconnected yet distinct, with the same divine rain flowing through them all, nurturing and sustaining life.
Within the grand expanse of the Pacific, there exists a small coral reef, a mere 200 feet across, hidden away in its depths. It is within one of the hollows of this reef that you will find your Earth, a tiny yet vibrant community teeming with diverse species and intricate ecologies. Among these beings, the human-fish, despite their small numbers, have risen to become the dominant predators, their actions often destructive and far-reaching.
On that reef, few beings have every heard of Earth-hollow, and fewer even have ever heard of human-fish. In the vast expanse of the Pacific, Earth-hollow is totally insignificant. Should Earth-hollow implode or explode, it won't raise eyebrows on the reef, and the Pacific never even knew that it existed. Our planet is exceptionally insignificant. The Pacific is full of majestic life forms and awe-inspiring structures and trillions of species of beings.
And you, and I, are of these metaphorical human-fish, an insignificant speck in the Hollow, and non-existent in the grand scheme of existence. Yet, through the grace of the Butterfly Path, an extraordinary opportunity lies before you --- the chance to transcend your mortal predator form and ascend to another dimension, where you may live as an immortal, wise, and benevolent being, joining the ranks of the most powerful, peaceful, and beautiful entities in the Pacific and beyond.
A divine guide, a deity from that exalted realm, chose you, and extends their hand to you, ready to walk alongside you on this transformative journey. This gift, statistically impossible to calculate and express, rests within your grasp, a precious treasure waiting to be claimed.
What makes this magnificent gift even more precious, even more unlikely, is that the choice to embark on the Butterfly Path is entirely yours. Many humans will become distracted, choosing to ignore the true purpose of life. Only a small percentage will heed the call and walk the Path to graduation. Yet, the opportunity is freely offered to all, a sacred gift nestled within your heart.
The power to embrace this gift lies within you. The decision is yours, and yours alone. Choose wisely, dear one, for the Pacific will notice your transformation, because then you will be significant to the wholesomeness of the System.
### Invitation to Connect with the Wayist Community

## Glossary of Terms
**Mystical Practice:** The intentional and regular engagement in activities such as meditation, prayer, contemplation, or energy work to cultivate a direct, experiential connection with the divine, often leading to heightened states of awareness, spiritual insight, and personal transformation.
**Mystical Assimilation:** The ongoing process of integrating the insights, wisdom, and transformative effects of mystical experiences into one's daily life, relationships, and spiritual practice, leading to greater self-awareness, compassion, and alignment with divine purpose.
**Divine Tarayoga:** A sacred practice in Wayist spirituality that involves attuning one's spiritual energy and consciousness to the guidance, wisdom, and loving presence of one's Divine Tara through techniques such as visualization, mantra recitation, and deep devotion.
**Mystiception:** A state of heightened spiritual perception and awareness that transcends ordinary consciousness, characterized by profound experiences of unity, insight, and connection with the divine. During deep states of meditation, prayer, or contemplation, individuals primarily experience mystiception through the spirit-minds rather than the rational intellect.
**Mysticeptive Capacity:** An individual has an innate potential for experiencing and cultivating states of mystiception, which can be developed and enhanced through consistent spiritual practice, self-reflection, and attunement to divine energy.
**Mysticeptive State:** A heightened state of spiritual awareness in which an individual experiences a profound sense of connection, clarity, and spiritual awareness, often accompanied by feelings of peace, joy, and unconditional love. Individuals achieve this state through regular mystical practice and spiritual attunement.
**Mysticeptive Gateway:** A metaphorical term referring to the threshold between ordinary consciousness and the realm of profound spiritual experience, often described as the "opening of the gates of heaven." Crossing this threshold allows for deep states of mystiception and communion with the divine.
**Mysticeptual Insight:** The profound wisdom, guidance, and understanding that arises from states of mystiception, often providing clarity and direction for personal growth, spiritual evolution, and decision-making in daily life.
**Theopathy:** An intensely profound and transformative spiritual experience characterized by a direct, empathetic connection with the divine, often accompanied by overwhelming feelings of love, reverence, awe, and unity. Theopathy represents one of the most profound states of mystical experience and spiritual realization.
**Theopathic Nexus:** A pivotal point in the mystical journey where an individual experiences a profound convergence of their emotional, psychological, and spiritual energies with the divine, often leading to a transformative shift in consciousness and a deepening of their spiritual connection.
**Theopathic Attunement:** The process of gradually harmonizing one's consciousness and energy with higher divine frequencies through consistent mystical practice, self-purification, and devotion, enabling more profound and sustained experiences of theopathy.
**Theopathic Resonance:** A state of deep spiritual resonance in which an individual's consciousness vibrates in harmony with the energy and presence of the divine, often experienced as a profound sense of unity, love, and spiritual ecstasy.
**Theopathic Communion:** A state of profound spiritual intimacy and union with the divine, often experienced during intense states of theopathy, in which an individual feels a deep sense of belonging, understanding, and interconnectedness with all of creation.
**Spirituality:** In the Wayist context, spirituality refers to the holistic process of awakening to one's true nature as an eternal spiritual being and aligning one's thoughts, emotions, and actions with this understanding. It involves cultivating a direct, experiential connection with the divine through practices such as meditation, prayer, and self-reflection, while embodying qualities such as love, compassion, and wisdom in daily life. Spirituality is necessarily transformative --- it changes you as a person. It makes you wise and gives you insight into self, others, and the nature of being.
**Psychuality:** A term used to differentiate practices and beliefs that primarily engage the psyche or mind, such as devotion to specific deities, adherence to religious doctrines, and identification with soul-religious groups or traditions that worship entities with soul-like characteristics and qualities. While psychuality can provide structure and meaning for the soul-minds, it is distinct from spirituality, which emphasizes direct spiritual experience and inner transformation practiced mainly through spirit-minds.
**Soul-Minds:** The subtle energy centers or aspects of consciousness associated with the lower chakras, such as the Muladhara (root), Svadhisthana (sacral), and Manipura (solar plexus), which are primarily concerned with survival, emotional security, power, and identity. In Wayist teachings, the soul-minds are distinct from the higher spirit-minds.
**Spirit-Minds:** The subtle energy centers or aspects of consciousness associated with the higher chakras, such as the Anahata (heart), Vishuddhi (throat), Ajna (third eye), and Sahasrara (crown), which are primarily concerned with unconditional love, truth, intuition, and spiritual realization. In Wayist teachings, cultivating and aligning the spirit-minds is essential for spiritual growth and mystical experience.
**Psychomesion:** A term derived from the Greek words "psyche" (soul) and "mesos" (middle), referring to the intermediate realm or dimension between physical reality and the higher spiritual realms. The Psychomesion is a transitional space where souls may linger after death, and is sometimes associated with the astral plane in other spiritual traditions.
**Malipsyches:** A term derived from the Greek words "mali" (bad or evil) and "psyche" (soul), referring to disembodied souls or entities who are harmful or have malevolent intentions. In Wayist teachings, Malipsyches are souls who lurk in the Psychomesion and seek to live in a human body but have been expelled from Butterfly Path school.
**Karman Active Meditation:** A sacred practice in Wayist spirituality that combines mindful movement, breathwork, and spiritual attunement to cultivate a direct connection with the divine. Through a series of fourteen movements, each imbued with symbolic meaning, practitioners learn to harmonize their body, mind, soul and spirit energies.
**Brain-mind:** We have ten minds while in the human condition. The mind created by the biological brain is one of three minds created by the biological human body. The other two are the collective mind of the billions of non-human entities who live in and on the organic body, and some organs have mind. The other seven minds are the three soul-minds, the Anahata (heart chakra) mind, which is the bridge between soul and spirit, and the three spirit-minds.
**Chrestotes:** In Wayism, this is a fundamental principle. It surpasses compassion and love by translating into action and tangible support. Humility, Simplicity, and Chrestotes are the Three Gems that form the core principle of Wayism. Sometimes, people use the lesser correct term Compassion instead of Chrestotes, to avoid having to explain the deep meaning of Chrestotes. The term used by Lord Jesus in the Koine Greek which he spoke, denotes the spiritual competence of demonstrating loving-kindness and possessing the wisdom to determine the suitable form of helpful kindness in a given context. Sometimes no help is the best help, sometimes a simple encouragement is the best help. Chestotes is the most advanced spiritual skill we will learn, the wisdom of which takes multiple lifetimes to accomplish. The wisdom of the difference between "good and bad" is nowhere else so minutely studied as here, in chrestotes.
**Udbhu-kanti (n.):** A Wayist principle that emphasizes living a life of simplicity, authenticity, and harmony with the natural world, by embracing the concepts of "knowing your enough," and "authenticity is sufficient beauty".
**Dynamisometric:** Karman Meditation incorporates a unique form of physical exertion known as dynamisometric exercise. This practice transcends traditional isometric techniques by combining dynamic movement with self-regulated resistance. In dynamisometric exercise, practitioners engage their muscles against an imagined force, allowing for joint mobility and muscle elongation or contraction throughout the movement.
