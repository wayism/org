## This is her story \~ This is our story
In the year 33, as Roman legions cast long shadows across Jerusalem, and Sanskrit chants echoed through the valleys of the Himalayas. A great light was about to emerge from the intersection of East and West.
While Rome tightened its grip on Jewish extremism in Judea, and Buddhist monasteries in the East debated the nature of enlightenment for men. A story was unfolding that would bridge these worlds and transform them both.
This is not merely a tale of one woman's journey from darkness to light, though it is that. Nor is it simply an account of how a great spiritual teacher walked the Earth and changed it forever, though it is that too. This is the story of how love proved stronger than death, how wisdom flourished in the most unlikely places, and how the greatest spiritual revolution in human history began not in temples or palaces, but in the heart of a girl sold into slavery.
The world she was born into was one of rigid manmade divisions --- between pure and impure, holy and profane, man and woman, East and West. In India, the caste system declared some people untouchable and unworthy of divine Light while others were considered divine by birth. In Jerusalem, priests crafted elaborate rules about who could approach their god and who could be exploited because they are not the "chosen people" of their wrathful god. In Rome, emperors claimed divinity while keeping slaves. And everywhere, women were considered property, their voices silenced, their spirits crushed.
Yet beneath these human-made barriers, ancient wisdom persisted. In India's sacred groves, mystics taught that divinity dwells in every heart. In Persia, fire-worshippers spoke of light and darkness dancing in eternal balance. In Egypt's temples, priestesses preserved the knowledge that the Divine had both mother and father aspects. And in small communities everywhere, people whispered of a great teacher who would come to break down the walls between heaven and earth.
They did not expect this teacher to one day make an appearance in a brothel in Srinagar, in Kashmir, or to choose from there as his closest disciple, a girl whose life had been shattered by human cruelty. They did not expect wisdom to flow from East to West and back again, carried by them whom society had rejected.
They did not expect the greatest spiritual gateway in human history to open not through ritual or sacrifice, but through the simple recognition that love, humbleness, simplicity, and loving-kindness transcend all boundaries.
This is the story of Mother Mari of Magadha, known to some as the Magdalene --- though that name carries different meanings in different tongues. Born in India's ancient kingdom of Magadha, sold into slavery as a child, she would walk beside the greatest teacher history has known and become herself a light for countless souls. Her journey would take her from the depths of human degradation to the highest realms of spiritual attainment, proving that no soul is beyond redemption, no heart too wounded to be healed, no darkness too deep for light to penetrate.
It is also the story of a revolution --- not of swords and armies, but of hearts and minds. A revolution that would transform how humans understand their relationship with the divine, breaking down the barriers between heaven and earth, between male and female, between East and West, between religion and spirituality. A revolution that continues to unfold today.
In the end, it is a story about the power of love to transform everything it touches, about the wisdom that can emerge from the deepest wounds, and about the truth that divinity dwells not in temples made by human hands, but in the sacred space of the heart.
This is her story. This is our story. This is the story of how heaven and earth learned to dance together in a new way, and how a single soul's journey from darkness to light illuminated the path for countless others to follow.
Chapter 1
## He was murdered, by people who censor speech, thought, and minds
The sun has not yet risen over the hills beyond Jerusalem, but I am here, at his tomb. My body remembers other dawns, other stone paths, months and years of journeys beside him. But this morning is like none before. My Lord. My love, had died.
He was murdered, by people who censor speech, thought, and minds. He is in that grave carved into the mountainside. With that big stone covering its opening\...
Today, the air in Jerusalem holds that peculiar stillness it wore in my hometown in Magadha, before the Indian monsoons.
That was way back, when I was a child and still believed in fathers and justice. Before, I learned that men could look upon a young girl and see only coins. Before, I learned that gods could look upon a broken woman and see only light.
I touch the rough wall of the tomb. Real. Present. This is a habit he taught me --- to anchor myself in the moment, when memories threaten to pull me under. How can I ever forget his voice? Never\...
"Feel the stone, Mari," he would say, those blue eyes against his sunbaked skin holding mine steady. "Feel your feet on the earth. You are here now. You are safe."
Safe. Such a simple word. I did not know its meaning until that day in Srinagar when he walked into the room where I waited. I was a child in a young woman's tired body, owned by a brothel. Where I had spent seven years learning to make my soul small, to tuck it away where customers could not reach it.
He looked at me --- through me --- and I felt naked in a way no client had ever managed. But, for the first time\... nakedness brought no shame.
"Come." Was all he said, with his hand indicating to sit on the floor beside him. And I did. I have been with him ever since, for almost fifteen years through arid and harsh deserts and mountains, through rejection and acclaim, through miracles and mundane moments. Even now, still, I "came", though they sealed his broken body behind stone.
The sky is lightening. Perhaps the others will arrive --- Mother Mary, the teachers in training, the women who followed him. But it's Passover\... and the religious police ... maybe the others won't come today.
They call me his beloved disciple. True. But they don't understand what that means. How could they? Peter, especially. Jealous ---but he knows nothing. I think the Lord keeps him on the team, for some other purpose. Who knows? They never saw him wash the dirt from my feet after a long day's walk, never heard him laugh at my stubborn questions, never watched him defend my right to learn, to teach, to be.
Images, memories, flooding my mind. I, I'm rambling. My Lord. My Love. Is in that tomb\...
We've been serving others for so long.
But this morning belongs to me alone.
This moment between dark and light, between cruel religion and beneficent heaven, between death and whatever comes after. I am here because I know him. And because he knows me --- knows every scar, every failing, every secret place, where shame once lived. He knows my naked soul, and loves anyway.
The stone blocking the opening has been sealed with cement!
It was like a lifetime ago\... My home in Magadha, once the kingdom of the parents of Siddharta, who was destined to become the Buddha of the religion of male monks.
In Magadha, on a clear day, you can see the Himalayas over Nepal. Dreams taste of mango and monsoon rain. Clear waters rush down from the mountains, and create the mother of rivers, Mother Ganga. The boys used to lie to us and say, "If you fall asleep on your raft in the Ganges, you will wake up in Calcutta."
Even now, decades and thousands of miles from home, I sometimes wake with that sweetness on my tongue, that dampness on my skin. For a moment, I am ten years old again, watching the sunrise paint the stupas gold, listening to my mother's voice rise in morning prayer.
But memory is a treacherous companion. The sweetness never lasts. It shatters, always, against the hardness of what came after. Against my father's voice, tight with shame: "What else could I do? The official would have ruined us all. It is "YOUR" fault, playing dirty games with his daughter!" It shatters against, the rope burns on my wrists as the slave trader dragged me away. Shatters against, that first night when I learned how completely a human being can disappear inside herself.
These are not things I speak of often. Even now, when women gather around me to learn of theWAY, I tell them only what they need to know: that I understand. That I have walked through darkness. That light finds us in unexpected places.
But lately, I find myself returning to those memories.
Perhaps, because he warned us, his time was growing short. Perhaps, because I see in the eyes of Jerusalem's religious people the same god-sanctioned righteous cruelty, I saw in the faces of men who would visit the brothel, where they kept us before morning prayers. Power corrupts the soul, so quietly, so completely. I learned that lesson young.
Seven years in Srinagar's brothels taught me to read men's souls in their eyes as they sought their pleasures. The holy ones were often the cruelest. They would punish us for their sins, then purify themselves afterward with extra prayers, extra offerings, while we girls washed their sweat from our bodies, and counted our cuts and bruises.
Some of us died. Most of us wished we had.
"Oh, you must hate men so much," some would say. "Why?" I ask, "I see the souls of people and I have seen good men and evil women of all sorts. Souls have no gender. Good people built this city, bad people prey on them and rape this city."
I was different; they said. Too proud. I kept Sanskrit texts hidden under my pallet and taught myself to read by the light of ghee lamps, with wicks we made from lake grass. Most scrolls I had stolen from holy men, from priests and monks, temples, and pagodas where they took us for their pleasures. I asked questions that made customers uncomfortable, and then get beatings because it's not my place to ask.
"The Magadhalene thinks she's better than us," the other girls would whisper. They weren't wrong. Pride was all I had left.
Some would buy me just to break me. Because I still had my pride. In their minds, I was still whole, and they wanted to break something that was whole.
Self-righteous people are the worst, entitled, the self-styled elite ---the worst. They dehumanize others. No matter woman or man, the worst, because they take a moral high-ground and dehumanize us who are "the other".
The wealthiest, the Lord taught me, are the Predatorial class --- they hate, and enjoy that they are so evil, and call themselves the Elite, as if that will help.
But it was not me they abused, the Predators; I was not there. I never did give them anything of myself.
Chapter 2
## He sat on the floor, not on the bedroll
I was prepared for anything from customers --- violence, depravity, degradation, false piety, shame, sadness that the wives they loved had lost interest in carnality, loneliness.
I was always prepared for anything from customers, because you never could tell what was to come. Until the day he walked into his cell in the monastery, where they told me to wait for 'my monk' --- the monk I was to tempt simply by being a naked woman, a test of his vows of self-control. Despicable, yes, but that was how they graduated from the sect, and it made money for my owner.
But I was not prepared for simple light. For eyes that looked at me and saw\... me. Not flesh to be bought. Not an object for self-therapy. Not sin to be purged. Just a soul, "precious beyond measure," he said.
He walked in and sat down across from me on the floor. He sat on the floor, not on the bedroll. Without closing the door as others do. "You have questions," he said, in perfect Sanskrit and a disarming smile.
Not a customer's demand, but a teacher's invitation.
I must have stuttered in my mind because nothing came out of my usually quick-witted mouth. I couldn't look away from his eyes, and my voice failed me.
"Why do you go by Mari?" he asked gently. "Is that how you see yourself?"
That, I could answer - a question asked a thousand times before. "My father gave me that name. My other name died when I was small."
He looked deep into my soul and nodded slightly, he understood. "What questions in your heart," he prodded with a sincerity and ease that again caught me off guard.
"uhm\... About suffering?" I answered into the atmosphere of his cell, the words escaping before I could catch them. "About the divine --- that lets it happen?"
He looked at me with those piercing foreigner eyes. Blue eyes. Looking so deep into me. Yet, I did not feel unsettled by it. Usually, we are disturbed by those foreigner eyes, but not his. His, had the colour and peace of heaven. Perhaps his stature calmed me. Unlike the saffron-robed monks, had a full head of hair, long, black, strong, but different because of a slight wave in it.
His body. I was not interested in the male physique, but he was beautifully male by all standards. Tall. His body hard, muscled. His grey-white robe covered one shoulder, there was a big scar on his chest. Of course, it was from saving a damsel from a tiger or something. Calloused hands and feet, sun-drenched olive skin, like a worker. I guessed him to be about twenty-something years old, but his soul was ancient. His nails were clean, his natural fragrance was like a smoky agar wood, and of course, that smile; it can melt the sandals off the feet of a recently wedded.
Again, he smiled, and the room filled with such love I could hardly breathe. I was seated on his bedroll. "Come," he said, holding out his hand for support. "Sit here. Let us seek those answers together."
I hesitated only a moment. Making myself vulnerable to him by talking about myself. What was there to lose? I had already lost everything once.
But as I reached for his hand, I realized I was wrong. You can't lose everything. There is always more to lose, more to gain, more to become. I know, having watched the same hand that lifted me from darkness in that cell, just yesterday his hand was hanging brutalized and bloody, on a Judeo-Roman cross. The cross of hypocrisy, religion, and empire.
They say you can't look directly at the sun. Perhaps that's why he came to us veiled in human flesh --- so we could bear to see such light. But I saw it that first day, burning through his human eyes. And now I have watched that light seem to go out.
Three days. He promised three days and he will be back.
I touch the stone of his tomb, anchoring myself in the present moment as he taught me. The sky is lightening. Tomorrow, after Passover, others will arrive with their spices and lamps. But this day, this moment, belongs to me alone. This space between what was and what will be.
He didn't touch me that first day. No man had ever been in my presence without demanding touch, but he simply sat, those extraordinary eyes holding mine, and waited. When I finally found my voice again, the questions I had hoarded like precious stones came tumbling out.
He answered in Sanskrit so pure; it made my amateur studies seem like a child's babbling. He spoke Greek. Most of us had some Greek. But locals spoke a mixture of many dialects and languages south of here.
Yet his Sanskrit wove in concepts I recognized from the streets of Srinagar --- traders' tales of Persian fire-worshippers, Buddhist wanderers' talks of karma and dharma, even fragments of Greek philosophy that occasionally drifted up from the merchants' quarter.
When he mentioned God his Mother in Heaven, I was intrigued. He spoke of a Father in Heaven who was not like the stern, demanding gods of the priests --- a Father of Light, who looked upon all beings with infinite compassion. No judging, just compassion.
"Even me?" I asked, the words bitter in my mouth.
"Especially you," he said, and smiled in a way that made the room grow brighter. "Your soul has remained pure despite all attempts to defile it. Do you know how rare that is?"
I wanted to laugh, or perhaps weep. Pure? Me? But he was already continuing, speaking of things I had never dared to hope --- of wisdom that comes through suffering, of light that burns brightest in darkness, of a way that leads beyond all this pain to something beautiful beyond imagining.
He spoke of a Butterfly Path, of being reborn in heaven to live with God the Mother of Heaven and all the gods and buddhas.
He spoke about heavenly family, the holy lotus family he called it. Spiritual beings are beneficent by nature. They don't judge and don't punish or reward, they just love and protect.
God our Mother of Heaven. The divine feminine, a Yin-energy. He spoke about how all things, heaven especially, needs balance of energies. Deities don't have humanlike bodies, spoken language or gender, we only imagine them that way. But they specialize in either yin-energy or yang-energy work, and the works are different.
He said, "Because we can make our energies different, humans feel us as male or female, because they are male and female. And our difference brings balance. Everything needs that balance."
My soul melted, softening its reservations.
"Your questions," he said, "they come from a place of wisdom. You see through the lies men tell themselves about gods and power. You understand already that true divinity has nothing to do with the games of priests and kings, or words in books."
"And what do you know of priests and kings?" I challenged, though something in me already knew the answer, already biting my tongue because it cannot help itself being snarky.
He laughed then, a sound like mountain streams in spring. "More than I sometimes wish to," he said. "Come with me, and I'll show you."
"Now?" I asked.
"Now, and forever," he said gently.
"To be your servant?" I asked, my voice hardening with old bitterness. "Your concubine?"
"My student," he said simply. "My friend. My sister in The Way."
He stood up, and I noticed for the first time really how tall he was. Or was it how his presence seemed to fill the small room. "You are no one's property, Mari of Magadha. You never were. Those who bought and sold you will answer to Karma for that sin. And one day, your dead name will rise from its grave to embrace you. But now I offer you a choice --- freely given, freely taken. Will you come?"
I touched the scar on my cheek. I looked at him --- really looked. I trusted him, God knows why. I had not trusted anyone in more than seven years. But, for the first time in seven years, I felt my soul unfurl from its tight hiding place. "I don't even know your name," I whispered.
"I am called many things," he said. "But you may call me Iesous."
"It's Greek?" I asked, "Like Yesu? Or is it Bactrian, like Oesho?"
He didn't answer. He knew I was rambling just to not make up my mind. He waited for my answer, allowing me time to think.
Later, much later, I would learn all his names, all his titles. I would watch kings bow before him and priests gnash their teeth in rage at his words. I would see him heal the sick with a touch and raise the dead with a word. I would love him with a depth that transcended any human category of love.
But in that moment, in that small room that smelled of stale wine and old pain, he was simply the first person in seven years to speak to my soul instead of my flesh. And when he held out his hand again, to walk me out of there, I took it.
But then it struck me, and my soul sank to the floor where my sandals were, in the corner, "Sir. My owner will demand money. Much more than what you have."
"Money is not the problem, but I will not pay him. You are no-one's property to buy and sell. You are Mari, and you belong to God our Mother and God our Father in Heaven! Come, sister\..."
Chapter 3
## Running away with an idealistic homeless man
He walked me out of that monastery down to the brothel, past the security, and accompanied me to my room. I owned nothing but the clothes I wore, and the texts hidden under my pallet, and a letter from my mother from years ago. He waited while I gathered them. His mere presence and energy, keeping the fuming brothel owner and his security man at bay with nothing more than a look.
The man yelled, "I will make the monastery pay! You thief!"
Iesous said gently as we passed by the sweaty fat man, "What a wonderful idea, sir. May your life soon reward you with all the karma you have coming to you. And, if you ever reach for, or come for, this woman, I will come at you with everything that is holy, straight to help you meet your karma head-on."
As we walked into the bright chaos of Srinagar's streets, I expected to feel afraid, exposed. My life surely would end if Iesous was unsuccessful, I should have been afraid. But instead, I felt my spine straightening, my chin lifting. With each emotional step away from my prison, I remembered a little more of who I had been, who I might become\...
"Where are we going?" I asked finally, as we reached the edge of the city, weary of looking over my shoulder for someone who would bring this dream to end.
He looked at me, and in his eyes, I saw mountains and deserts, rivers and seas, paths that went on forever. "Everywhere," he said. "We're going everywhere."
And then, some traveler recognized him and came to kneel at his feet, and he touched the man's head. And more people stopped. They asked him questions. Some just stared, basking in the glow they saw in him, but others don't. Some asked for blessings, which he always refused, saying, "It is not for me to bless you, but for you to open your heart and discover heaven inside and all the blessings of heaven become yours." Then he touched them on the chest, and they would walk away in a swoon.
As we walked on, I asked, "Who are you? Are we going to your house? Where is it?\..."
Iesous interrupted me, "This is my house," he said, waving his hand over the valley and mountain. "We sleep where we end up, we eat what is available, and we heal and teach whomsoever the angels bring."
No home? He has no home\... The irony did not pass me by; the fantasy of the prostitute to be bought over by a wealthy and charming man to be his beloved consort. But no, Mari had replaced it by running away with an idealistic homeless man.
"Just the two of us?" I asked.
"Other students will join, stay for a while, and then more come. Wherever you go there will always be people ready to become teachers," he said.
"I don't think I can be a teacher," I said.
"Yes, I know," he replied.
I thought about that, and something in his manner I was learning, made me ask, "Iesous, will I become a teacher?"
"Yes," he said, and showed me how a centipede has caught its prey for dinner. "Only human predators hunt for competition, profit, and pleasure. Others take what they need for the moment."
"When, sir," I asked.
"People don't easily become teachers, because they are lazy and often don't care. They would rather others don't see the light, than make some effort, or they don't yet have the compassion to want to help others. But you, in a week or two, you will be teaching."
"I am not, lazy," I whispered to myself.
The first weeks were a revelation. I watched him speak to everyone --- merchant and beggar, prince, and prostitute --- with the same clear-eyed compassion. We were invited to dinner with his friend, the new King of Kashmir, the nephew of the Gonophores family, rulers of the Parthian kingdoms.
He sent me to the market to buy a new outfit. I almost died of fear the sex mafia would abduct me. Who was he? His friend is the King, his companion a prostitute, and he keeps the company of beggars and farm laborers, monks, philosophers, and academics.
He would sit for hours with anyone who had questions about the WAY, yet he could silence arrogant priests with a single look. His knowledge seemed limitless --- not just of holy texts and philosophies, but of healing herbs, of stars and seasons, of the secret languages and lives of plants and animals, and their domestic issues, which he says, "plagues all families".
My mind, like a sponge, it drank up his wisdom wine, and I was drunk in awe.
"Who are you really?" I asked one evening as we sat by our small fire in the hills above Srinagar. He had spent the day teaching a group of Shaivite monks, explaining their own texts to them in ways that made their eyes grow wide with understanding, how the Upanishads and Prajnaparamita sutra all connect in the warp and weft of the universal purpose of life, and the Butterfly Path.
I learned, Our differences are in our minds and the markings we put on our bodies to show our tribe, but it's not real, it's of soul-people games. Now he was showing me how to brew a tea that would ease the monthly pains that still cramped my belly.
"You're beginning to see," he said, stirring the herbs with careful attention. "Your soul recognizes what your mind still struggles to grasp."
He was right. I had begun to notice things. How animals came to him without fear. How the very air seemed to brighten in his presence. How he knew things he couldn't possibly know --- like the pain I hadn't mentioned to anyone. Sometimes, when he was deep in teaching, I caught glimpses of something vast and bright behind his human eyes, like sunlight through clouds.
"You're not just a teacher," I said slowly. "You're\... more."
"I am a son of the Father of Heaven," he said simply. "One of many. But I have been sent here with a specific task --- to show souls the way home to Sukhavati."
"Sukhavati?" The word was familiar from my Buddhist studies. "The Western Paradise, where Buddha lives? Where there are no women to defile the place?"
He smiled. "Spirit-Heaven, yes. Where souls go when they graduate from Butterfly Path, this school of life. And that story about women. It's only the Buddhists who say that, but they also say God our Mother of Heaven, and my sister Prajnaparamita live there --- so --- again, the hypocrisy of religion turns to devour its reason."
We do this work, because humans have forgotten theWAY, it got lost in religions. They've buried ancient truth under layers of ritual and rule, turned simple wisdom into complex religions, made religions into powerful movements. They've forgotten that the point of life is to learn wisdom through living full human lives with loving-kindness.
Know this --- all the great enlightened ones you revere, like the Buddhas and Lord Krishna --- they are beings of pure spirit who dwell in Sukhavati, guiding souls toward the light. They are spirit-gods"
"Spirit-gods?" I asked.
He explained to me, "Consider how different the gods of soul-people are from the beings of true spirit," he said gently, but he must have seen that I didn't get it. "Soul-people create gods in their own image --- beings who demand worship, wrathful, demand sacrifice, who wage war, who trade favors for devotion and are tribal. But true spirit-beings are beneficent, oppose violence, they are like the sun that shines on all equally, like the rain that falls without asking who is worthy. We serve without requiring praise, guide without demanding obedience, love without conditions. To human eyes, our abilities may seem godlike, just as your works might seem magical to an ant. But, we are simply further along the path that all human souls can walk, if they care to\..."
"And you're here to remind the people?"
"To remind them of the purpose of life, of walking the Butterfly Path. To teach them. To open a gateway through which all souls can find their way to the Father and Mother in heaven, despite the blockages of religion and greed and empire."
He handed me the cup of tea.
I sipped, feeling the warmth spread through my belly. The evening air quiet, and deep.
"Why me?" I asked finally. "Why choose me as your student?"
"Because you never stopped questioning, you never stopped being a spirit-person, thinking with your spirit-minds. Because looking into yourself to learn, suffering taught you to see through lies. Because your soul is old, wise, and ready." He looked into the fire. "And because you'll understand what's coming, better than most."
"What's coming?" I asked, a bit suspicious i may not like to hear.
"Change," he said. "Revolution. Not with swords and armies, but in hearts and minds. The religions of Earth need renewal. When you challenge people's beliefs, soul-people get violent. They've forgotten the purpose of life, why they came here, so they easily become tools of power instead of paths to wisdom. The men write books they call Holy Scripture from God --- and in it they write soul-people oppression. We must free people. It won't be easy. Those who profit from keeping souls in darkness will resist. They have stacked the kindling in their basements, we will bring divine fire to set ablaze the forces of renewal."
I thought of the priests and bureaucrats, rulers, I'd known, of their jealously guarded power. I said, "They'll hate you for this."
"They already do." His smile was gentle, but his eyes were ancient, knowing\... "That's part of why you're here. You've seen the worst humans can do, yet kept your capacity for love. You'll need that strength in the days ahead."
"I'm to help you then? With this revolution?"
"You're to learn everything I can teach you. About healing body, and soul. About the energy we manage though our palms. About the true nature of spirit and the laws that govern all things. About the Mother and Father's love that holds the school on Earth together." He looked at me directly then, and I caught another glimpse of that vast brightness.
"And then you'll teach others. Long after this body I wear has served its purpose. The work among women and children, is the larger work. Were laying foundations for future liberation, of spirit-people. Help them break the bonds of religions and regimes. The work to light fires of renewal, my part, is the easy part. I and the male teachers, we do the yang. You and the female teachers, you do the yin. And Heaven keeps it all together."
A chill went through me despite the warm night. "What do you mean, after this body I wear?"
But he only smiled and began teaching me the names of constellations in Sanskrit, Greek, and language skills I'd never heard before. I let him change the subject, but his words echoed in my mind. Much later, I would understand them as both warning and promise.
For now, I drank my tea and listened to him explain how even the stars are temporary, how stars are home to many, many living worlds and living beings. How all things change and flow except the cosmic love that moves them. Above us, the Milky Way stretched like a river of light. He explained that it is our home, and uncountable numbers of soul-beings live in it, and we become helpers to them when we graduate from this school of divinity for souls.
And for the first time in my life, I felt truly, completely safe.
Chapter 4
## It\'s what Heaven teaches - all in heaven share one truth
We travelled east through Nepali regions, where ancient ashrams and temples fascinated our Lord. We travelled through Lumbini. where Buddha Siddharta was born, and he visited a shrine. The monks taught him the history of their Buddha. Iesous laid some flowers at a place considered holy to the religious people, and he spoke to the buddha in heaven as easy as I speak to butterflies.
He was a little amused though, at "human history" as he said. "Fantastic tales naturally devoid of fact," is the sentence burned into my memory.
On our way to Magadha, Iesous asked me if I would like to visit Pataliputra with him, or stay behind and meet up later.
He was concerned for me; to go to my birthplace and see the neighborhood I grew up in. "I cannot protect you from demons you want to carry, so you tell me," he said.
I said, "I don't know how to feel, my lord."
He said, "One day when you feel nothing, then you will be free."
Watching the lord speak to monks and priests all over the countries we visited, I began to understand the scope of his work. Iesous moved through the world like a master weaver, strengthening threads of truth wherever he found them, gently unpicking tangles of dogma and fear that bound people's souls.
Some days later, I had made up my mind. I told the lord, "Acharya, I feel nothing. I want to see Pataliputra again."
He smiled.
Later, when the students started cooking and making our roadside shelter, Iesous called me to him. He asked, "How did you come to feel nothing about it?"
I had to think, analyze how I did it. I said, "In my mind, I, I decided that I feel nothing."
"Did you cut the bonds?" he asked.
I realized he knew, "Yes sir, I cut the energy bonds with everyone, then I decided, and the nothingness came."
"Is there an emptiness where it was," he asked.
I had to feel around myself and search. "No, sir. It is as if that place of ill inside, never existed."
He said, "You changed it with your power of attitude. It's a spiritual skill. With attitude, you moved your thinking about that part of life, from a soul-mind which holds emotions according to its character, to another mind which does not hold the same types of energies.
You use your spiritual skill of Attitude to reprogram your mind. The Greek word for that is metanoia. Remember, because you will teach it. Metanoia, it means, to make over your minds. The Sanskrit word *sahmvidhi* does not say the same."
It was such an important lesson for me. I asked, "which minds did I use, sir?"
He explained, "You moved those memories and thinking about your childhood from Muladhara and Svadhisthana soul-minds to Vishuddhi spirit-mind. That is why you could cut the emotional bonds that soul holds, and keep the information and wisdom that spirit holds."
I remember our journey through the mountains west of Chitral, where the tribal people spoke of ancient prophecies about a teacher who would come from distant lands. They too had blue eyes, some of them.
They recognized something profound in the Lord, treating him with a reverence that made me uncomfortable when it extended to me as his companion.
For days, he would sit with their Zoroastrian priests, discussing their understanding of the eternal battle between light and darkness. With infinite patience, he showed them how the Absolute transcended such divisions, how our Father and Mother in Heaven worked within creation itself, not in opposition to it.
Yet with the mountain people themselves, he spoke differently --- with deep respect for their ancestral wisdom, saying they had preserved fragments of theWAY from times before their tribes existed.
They began building a shrine to honor his presence, and I saw them gathering materials for a second shrine. The Lord quietly led us away before they could complete their work, leaving our male companions bewildered by his reluctance to accept such devotion. "Truth needs no shrine," he told me later. "The human heart is temple enough."
"The human heart is temple enough". Those words made me cry. Oh, what a beautiful teaching, this Way, of Iesous!
In every town, every temple, every roadside camp, people were drawn to him. Yet he never sought to start a new religion, never asked anyone to abandon their traditions. Instead, he showed them the pure truth at the heart of their own beliefs, stripped of human complications. Yet. Many followed him, thousands of people of theWAY, all over the world continued the teaching and the healings.
"How do people know you are here, where do they come from?" I asked one day as we entered a town and people awaited him.
"The angels work hard to bring people to 'discover' their own truth and healing," he said.
"Look how they've built walls around wisdom," he said one evening, after leaving a temple where the priests jealously guarded their sacred texts from common eyes, as if "unclean eyes" will defile the holiness. He said, "They think truth belongs to them alone, that the Father's love can be contained in their rules and rituals."
I understood then why he had chosen someone like me --- branded unclean by every religion I knew --- as his student. What better way to show that the Divine was available to all?
"Was that the reason you chose me, Lord?" I asked one evening.
His answer shook me. "You may think that, what's in your mind. It's good thinking. But know this. My sister in heaven, whom I call Moonlight, has been searching for the most suitable woman to work alongside me. She chose you. You will meet her one day. I cannot do this work all by myself. Hundreds of angels and nearly as many humans, all are doing their part. You and I, were just the show horses who look pretty in front, they do the heavy lifting in the back. When I came, i did not bring money. Kings are paying to make this possible."
"Moonlight?" I said, touched by the tenderness of the name.
"Would you like to know why I call her that?" he asked, though something else seemed to weigh on his mind.
"Yes, please."
"I work in yang-energy mostly --- direct and harsh, like sunlight in your face, my teaching, my arguments, confronting. She, however, she works in yin-energy --- subtle, subconscious, intuitive, like moonlight in dreams. We are a team; we work as one. One day, you too will work with her. In Sanskrit, the ancients called her Mahāsthāmaprāpta, and Prajnaparamita."
I remembered that Sanskrit word, Prajnaparamita --- the Highest Wisdom. "Lord," I said, "I remember your teaching in Gilgit. You called it the Prajnaparamita teaching. The people at the scroll duplicating monastery, the Brotherhood of White Light, recorded it as Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya --- the heart of the highest wisdom. Is that your sister's teaching?"
Iesous considered this carefully before answering. "There's an important lesson here. Simplicity is essential --- only the simple will survive. Teaching must be very simple. People tend to complicate what they don't understand. Once something becomes complex and illogical, they think it more valuable, and teachers sell their services explaining the unexplainable. In Gilgit, I told the monks this was the heart of the teaching, though there's more around it. Already they've named it 'Heart Sutra' in Greek. The process of complication began even before we left that monastery. Soon no one will understand it, making it even more precious to them, because of its obscurity. They will have to explain it to people, so they have jobs and status. We, we must keep truth too simple to complicate."
I nodded my understanding, but pressed on: "Is it your sister's teaching, Lord?"
He continued, "There is no 'my' or 'her' teaching. It's what Heaven teaches --- all in heaven share one truth. If people make up their own stories, that's their teaching. Heaven has only one teaching, and we all share that. Mari, be careful with divisions and separations. Soon you'll see more than enough of divisions, categories, and the hardships of soul-people."
I willfully ignored that last warning. I didn't want to hear that our current peace and beauty would change. It was too much to bear. I pushed it from my mind --- that was for later, for when I would be ready.
Chapter 5
## Soul-people see kindness through the lens of power
I remember so many incidents of Iesous learning more and more about how society treats women. It wasn't easy for him --- for me, it was just normal life. When he began teaching me to do energy healing, some of his other followers objected. "Master," they would say, "she is a woman. She touches people. And her past\..."
"Her past is why she understands suffering," he would reply. "How better to heal than through wounds that have already been transformed into wisdom?"
Once I said to him, perhaps if I cut my hair and bound my breasts tight and be covered all the time they will stop. He said, "And then? What would your presence teach them?"
He taught me everything --- how to read bodies and soul-minds for signs of distress, how to channel healing energy, how to speak to the disembodied souls who hover near the sick and dying. How to stop malipsyches from inhabiting weak people. But more importantly, he taught me to trust my own inner knowing, the wisdom that my harsh life had planted in me.
Sometimes we would go days without speaking, walking the dusty roads in comfortable silence. Other times we would talk through the night, his answers sparking new questions in an endless dance of discovery. He never treated me as less than any male disciple. If anything, he seemed to delight in my stubborn internal struggles, my refusal to accept easy answers.
"Why do you let me challenge you so? I feel ashamed, so many times. And sometimes I speak more than the other students," I asked once, after a particularly heated debate about the nature of Karma.
"Because you're not really challenging me," he said, his eyes twinkling. "You're challenging your own understanding, because you're open to change. You can and do change your mind. That's what a good student should do. Why you get so loud and animated about it, so much that you apologize frequently, well, that changes by the moon, by the wind, and by what we eat. One day you will know to manage your energies and always be even-minded."
"I'm sure you would like that, sir. When that time comes," I offered, hanging my head for recognizing myself.
He looked at me with earnest eyes, "I pray to the Father and the Mother for them to call me back before life gets boring like that. Change for your own sake, my dear, but slowly please."
"But why do I burn with such fire when I struggle to understand, sir?"
"Think of how a tree grows," Iesous said gently. "Its roots run deep into the earth, anchoring everything above. That is like your Muladhara soul-mind. The roots of the soul. That is where people hold their beliefs. When you question deeply held beliefs, it is like pulling at those roots. People become fearful, even angry, because these beliefs are the foundation of their whole world. This is why some lash out when their beliefs are challenged --- they fear everything they know might crumble. But you, Mari --- you have the courage to examine your roots and let them grow stronger."
"I know people who have no beliefs. What of them?" I said.
He said, "They are like waterside plants. They do well when it's wet, not so well when seasons change, and when strong winds or heavy rains, they are uprooted and swept away."
How then do people change their beliefs if they cannot be uprooted? I wondered by myself. He read my mind. He said, "Think of yourself as a tree. Yes, uprooting is hard. You were planted in a nursery for seedlings, in Magadha. Then you were uprooted and planted in a place with harsh conditions. It made the young plant hardy. Then came along a good gardener, uprooted you and planted you in very good soil, rich with cultural manure and decomposing waste that people shed. And now you bloom, and your fragrance sets forth, inviting women and children to come to your shade and comfort."
I shall never forget that. I so love the teaching of The Way.
But his teaching went far beyond words and wisdom. In those first years of travel, when my body still carried the rhythms of womanhood, he would appear silently at dawn with clean cloths, as if he had divined my need before I spoke it. During nights when memories stalked me like wolves in darkness, when I would wake gasping and trembling, he would materialize beside my pallet.
His presence alone seemed to anchor me to the present moment, his quiet voice teaching me how to find solid ground when the past threatened to drag the hidden teenage-me under.
The endless walking left all our feet blistered and raw, but I remember one evening with particular clarity the way he knelt without ceremony, bowl of herb-scented water in his hands, and began to wash my torn feet. The tenderness in his touch brought tears I couldn't explain.
"The Master shouldn't serve the student," I protested, my voice rough with emotion.
His hands never paused in their gentle work as he replied, "When the master teaches, he is serving the student. True teaching is among the hardest labors there is." Then he looked up, his eyes holding that infinite compassion that could break open the hardest heart. "But I'm not serving you. Only soul-people see kindness through the lens of power - master and servant, high and low. Spirit-people understand that God the Father and God the Mother in Heaven are the greatest of servants, sustaining the Butterfly Path and souls in the school of life moment by moment, yet theirs is the greatest power of all."
In those words, in those divine hands that had healed lepers, yet did not disdain to bind my blistered feet, I began to understand what real power looked like. And slowly, watching him day after day, the others in our group began to see it too, how true strength shows itself not in dominance, but in the capacity to serve with an open heart.
Some students stayed for a few months, then went home to serve People of theWAY in their countries. I watched him closely, learning not just from his words but from how he moved through the world. How he could be gentle with the broken, yet terrifyingly fierce with those who broke them. How he could debate philosophy with scholars in the morning and play with children in the afternoon. How he could be fully human yet somehow more than human at the same time.
He had ultimate power, but never called on it. I remember once when a scoundrel grabbed a bag of food and a bag with scrolls, Iesous ran after him but without touching him from behind, made the man stop. Iesous stepped in and took our bags. The scoundrel tried to kick and grab at the Lord. Iesous looked at him sternly and said, "Don't fight me, fight her," and pointed to me. The next moment it was as if four invisible people punched the man from all sides, while he looked at me in painful disbelief. as if I was the one doing it. Iesous said, "Give him some food if you think he deserves it."
I gave the man some flatbreads and a dried fish, and I said to him, "Next time, be nice. Ask. And if you want to punch someone, always remember how this little girl punched your face, and you cried."
That lesson for me was about chrestotes learning what is true help, and true kindness. We helped the man in a way that he needed most.
I began to understand that Iesous can command immense resources from Heaven, from true and real gods. He can also command immense resources from at least one king that I know of. But he only needs the resource of being human. He is doing it all just by being an exemplary human. Calling on friends to beat the scoundrel up was just for a smile, and teaching him a loving lesson in a language he understands. I learned the gods have a well-developed sense of humor, and several languages that different people understand.
And I began to understand something else, something that both thrilled and terrified me. He was preparing us for a time when he would no longer walk beside us in flesh.
"All things change, Mari," he said one night, after healing a dying child had left him unusually weary. "Even this body must serve its purpose and then return to dust. But what I truly am --- what we all truly are --- that is eternal."
I wanted to protest, to deny the shadow I sometimes saw pass over his face when he spoke of the future. Instead, I asked the question that had been growing in my heart:
"Who are you really, my Lord?"
He turned to me then, and for a moment the human veil dropped away entirely. I saw him as he truly was --- a being of such light and power that my mind could barely comprehend it. A son of Heaven, temporarily clothed in flesh to help souls find their way home.
"You know," he said softly. "You've always known."
And I had. From that first moment in Srinagar, some part of me had recognized him. Had recognized something in myself too, a capacity for devotion to the divine I'd thought long dead, transformed now into something deeper than any human love.
Chapter 6
## God our Mother in Heaven
Teaching came naturally to me once I learned to trust my voice again. Perhaps because I remembered my own questions, my own desperate search for meaning in suffering. Women especially sought me out, sensing that I understood their wounds, their hopes, their need to find something sacred within themselves that no one could defile.
Iesous would often sit quietly at the back of these gatherings, his presence a warm encouragement. But he let me find my own way of teaching, different from his, but no less true. Where he would use parables about farmers and fishermen, I drew on my knowledge of sacred texts and my own harsh experience. Where he spoke of the Father's love, I spoke of the Mother's wisdom lying hidden in every soul, waiting to be awakened.
"You see?" he said one evening after such a teaching. "This is why you needed to keep your Sanskrit texts, even in the brothel. Why you needed to question everything, even when it brought you pain. All of it was preparation."
"For what?"
"For helping others find theWAY." He smiled. "Because you worked on your own healing. Your wounds make you a better guide than someone who has never been lost."
But not everyone welcomed a woman who dared to teach spiritual truths. At one monastery, the monks refused to let me enter, calling me unclean because I can have a monthly. Iesous' eyes flashed with that terrible brightness I had come to recognize as divine anger. I knew he controlled that energy, for I swear it could kill a man, that gaze.
"You who claim to teach wisdom cannot recognize it when it stands before you," he said, his voice carrying an authority that made them step back. "She has earned her place through suffering and dedication while you hide behind your walls, hoarding knowledge that was meant to be shared. You dare present yourself as intermediary between people and deities, but that is like putting a linen covered with cow dung, between the milk and the pail..."
He would have said more, but I touched his arm. "Let them be," I said softly. "Their time will come."
He looked at me with pride then, seeing how I had learned to meet rejection with compassion rather than anger. We left the monastery and taught instead under the trees, where anyone could come to listen. And they did come --- not just women and outcasts, but seekers of all kinds, drawn by the freedom they sensed in our teaching. And the monks watched from a distance.
"The truth cannot be contained in buildings," Iesous told the people. "It lives in your hearts, in your questions, in your deepest longings for something more than what your religions have given you."
I watched their faces as understanding dawned --- the same liberation I had felt that day in Srinagar when he showed me I was more than my past, more than my wounds, more than what others had made of me.
But with growing success came growing danger. I could sense the resistance building among religious authorities, could see the fear in their eyes when they realized how many of their followers were beginning to question their authority. They watched us especially closely when we taught about the Father's direct love, available to all, without priestly intervention.
And I watched them, time and again, squirm when Iesous talked of God his Mother in Heaven.
"Why, Lord? Why do these people of the Buddhist lands don't like to hear that God the Father has a wife, that she is Queen of Heaven?"
"Oh, you must see the people in the West. The Jews. They have the real problem. Soon...," he said and his voiced trailed away.
"They will try to stop us," I said one night.
"They will try," he agreed. "They have always tried. But truth cannot be killed, beloved one. Remember that in the days ahead."
There was that shadow again in his voice, that hint of foreknowledge that made my heart ache. I wanted to ask more, but just then a group of sick people were brought, seeking healing, and we turned to the work at hand.
This was how we lived --- teaching, healing, showing through our own example that the divine could work through anyone who opened themselves to it. My past became not a source of shame, but a testament to the transforming power of love. My questions became not a sign of disrespect, but a path to deeper understanding.
Months turned into years.
And through it all, I watched him --- my teacher, my lord, my closest friend --- walking steadily toward something I could not yet see but could feel approaching like a storm on the horizon.
The last thing he taught me in the East, was about death. Not in words --- he had already given me more teaching than most humans could hold --- but through an incident that would stay with me forever.
We were in a village near Takshashila, when they brought him a dead child. Not recently dead --- the body was already stiff. The family's wailing had gone hoarse with hours of grief. The mother clutched her son's small form, rocking, while the father stood silent, tears cutting clean tracks through the dust on his face.
I had seen Iesous heal before --- countless times. Had learned to channel healing energy myself under his guidance. But this was different. Death was final, or so I had always believed.
He knelt beside the family, his presence somehow both infinitely gentle and crackling with power. "Do you trust me?" he asked the mother in her own language.
She looked up at him --- really looked --- and I saw the moment she recognized what I had seen that first day in Srinagar. Something more than human, clothed in human flesh. "Yes, Lord," she whispered.
"Do you believe he is now in Paradise, and he wants to come back to help you on the farm?"
"Yes, my Lord," she whimpered and cried, "I believe that so."
He took the child's cold hands in his. And then\... I still struggle to describe what happened next. The air itself seemed to bend around him. Light that wasn't light filled the room. For a moment, I saw him as he truly was --- a being of such power that my mind could barely comprehend it. He spoke a word in a language, or just a sound, a vibration, I had never heard before and will never forget.
The child opened his eyes. And his wounds were healed.
Later, after the family's tears of joy had subsided, after the village's celebration had quieted, I found him sitting alone under the stars.
"How?" I asked simply.
"I did this for you to observe. We don't interfere in karma, but this was an accident, not Karma. Death is not what humans think it is," he said. "It is a doorway, nothing more. I simply called him back through it." He looked at me intently. "Remember this, Mari. Remember that death has no final power. You will need this knowledge soon."
"In Jerusalem?" I asked, that now-familiar chill running through me.
"Yes." His smile was sad, but somehow triumphant. "They think death is an ending. We will show them it is only a beginning."
"What is it like in Jerusalem?" I asked. "Is it like here, the mountains, or like Magadha?"
"Not," said Iesous. "Perhaps more like the area west of Mathura."
I was happy to hear that. "Oh, so it's desert-like, with beautiful temples and art, but it's dry?"
"Not," said Iesous, and looked at me sideways, studying my soul-minds. I have learned when he does that, he sees something new in you. "They don't have art. Not as you know it. The Romans have art. But the people of Jerusalem..." His voice trailed off.
I wanted to ask more, but a group of villagers approached, eager for teaching, and the moment passed. We spent several more days there, teaching, healing, and showing people how to find the divine spark within themselves. But something had shifted. I could feel us turning westward, like plants bending toward the sun.
The night before we left, I had a dream. I saw him standing on a hill, silhouetted against a dark sky, his arms stretched wide in what could have been either embrace or agony. Light poured from him. Not the gentle radiance I was used to, but something fierce and terrible and beautiful beyond words. A gateway opened behind him --- not a physical door, but a tearing in the fabric of reality itself. Through it, I caught a glimpse of such glory that my soul ached.
I woke to find him watching me, his eyes full of stars and secrets. "Now you begin to understand," he said softly.
"I'm not sure I want to," I answered honestly.
"No." He smiled. "Understanding comes at a price. But you are stronger than you know, Mari of Magadha. Strong enough to bear witness. Strong enough to remember. Strong enough to show others the WAY when I am no longer walking beside you in flesh."
"They will kill you?, Lord" I asked with hesitant breath, almost inaudible. He could have ignored it, as if he didn't hear me.
"It's not me I am worried about so much as them. I think, and think, but cannot see a way to help them break free to save their own souls. But, that is why we go there, Mari. They worship earthly power and greed, and they will make religions and break religions. But we will try."
I didn't sleep much.
Dawn was breaking over the mountains. Soon we would begin the long journey west, leaving these lands where wisdom was honored for places where prophets were stoned. But in that moment between night and day, he began teaching me prayers in the heart-language of angels --- energy prayers; I would need in the dark hours coming, he said.
Chapter 7
## Galilee
The journey west to the country of Galilee, took us through lands where gods wore different faces, where prophets spoke of judgment rather than enlightenment. Where people are said to be inherently sinful and vile, in need of salvation from a wrathful god.
And where popular deities seemed like soul-mind people, given too much power.
I felt the change in Iesous too --- not in his teaching or his compassion, but in a new intensity of purpose. He began speaking more directly about our Father in Heaven and how our god is different to theirs, about the need to strip away layers of ritual and rule, to find the simple truth of divine love --- the love of a spirit God.
In Mesopotamia, we met people hungry for this message of direct spiritual connection.
But we also encountered the first violent resistance from religious authorities. They were different from the Buddhist monks, who had merely closed their doors to us --- these priests had political power and an entitlement because we were the dehumanized animals on the planet, and were quick to use it.
"Watch," Iesous told me one evening after we'd been forced to leave a town under threat of arrest. "See how they react when their authority is questioned. It will be worse in Jerusalem."
"Because their god demands obedience?" I asked, thinking of the harsh desert-deity these people feared.
"Because they have forgotten that no human can own divine truth," he replied. "They have built cages of law around their people's souls, convinced them that God's love must be earned through ritual and sacrifice." His eyes held that dangerous brightness. "They will not easily surrender that power."
As we moved closer to Galilee, I began to understand what he meant. Here, religion was not a path to wisdom, but a tool of control. Priests did not sit with seekers under trees, discussing the nature of reality --- they stood in magnificent temples, demanding tithes and sacrifice, slitting throats of animals and making blood sacrifices to the thirsty god, binding people's lives with endless rules.
Yet even here, people were drawn to Iesous. His message of simple truth, of direct access to divine love, spread like fire through dry grass. But unlike the peaceful reception in the East, here it sparked immediate opposition.
He always spoke in Greek. The only times I heard him speak Aramaic, I rushed over and tried to be near, because it would be harsh talk. Not that I understand what he said to those men, but anyone could see they were being verbally destroyed. He was different here, than he was back in the East.
I remember the first time I heard someone call him "dangerous." We were in a marketplace, and he was teaching about how the Father's love was freely available to all --- even women, even foreigners, even those whom the priests declared unclean. A well-dressed man pushed through the crowd, sneering.
"Dangerous nonsense!," he spat. "Would you have us throw away the Law? Let women and foreigners pollute our worship?"
Iesous looked at him with such compassion that the man stepped back. You see. He could glare at someone and make him freeze up. And he could exude so much compassion, someone would freeze up. "The Law was meant to lead you to love," he said quietly. "But you have made it a barrier instead of a bridge. Your father teaches you, 'Fear is the love of the Lord'. But not my Father. Our Father is a spirit being, not a soul being."
The man stormed off to report us to the local authorities, and I saw something spark in Iesous' eyes --- not fear, but a fierce determination, and a sadness.
"Now, it begins," he said softly.
Galilee was both homecoming and foreign land to him. Here, where he had spent barely a few of his early years, people remembered him as Joseph's son, the clever boy who asked too many questions, and never helped his father much in the woodwork shop. They could not, would not, see what I saw --- a being of light wearing human form, the son of Heaven walking dusty streets. To them, he was the carpenter's son, who left home and came back a wandering idealist preacher who turned his back on their god.
His family was different. His mother Mary saw him clearly --- I recognized in her eyes the same awe and love that filled my own heart. She welcomed me too, with a warmth that made my long-buried longing for mother-love ache anew.
The scent of fresh-baked barley bread and herbs filled her modest home, where dried flowers hung from the rafters. Remedies she'd learned from her own mother, she told me. The clay floor had been swept smooth and sprinkled with fresh mint leaves, a humble touch that spoke of both poverty and dignity.
In quiet moments between his teaching, she would tell me stories of his childhood, her hands never idle as she worked the dough for tomorrow's bread or mended a worn garment. The rhythmic motion of her fingers against the cloth seemed to help the memories flow more easily. "I knew," she told me one evening as we prepared food together, the sharp scent of fresh-cut onions making our eyes water, "from the moment the angel appeared to me. Knew he wasn't mine to keep. But oh, how it hurts sometimes, watching him walk toward what's coming."
I looked at her sharply. "You see it too? The shadow?"
She nodded, her hands steady as she kneaded bread, though her eyes were bright with unshed tears, saying, "From the beginning. It's part of why he was born --- this sacrifice that's coming. Maybe the sacrifice of a deity to live on Earth is just a moment in history, and the rest will take time. I don't understand it fully, but I trust. As you do."
Others joined us in Galilee --- local men and women drawn to his teaching, though few had the courage to follow openly.
Most memorable was his cousin John, fierce and uncouth yet pure as a desert storm, who had been preparing people for Iesous' message, though he hadn't fully understood it himself. He only heard bits of it as a child, before Iesous left town. But he was a man of theWAY, through and through.
But it was in the countryside around Galilee that Iesous seemed most himself, most free. Here he taught as he had in the East --- under olive trees whose silver leaves whispered in the afternoon breeze, by lakeshores where fishing boats bobbed gently on the water, their nets drying in the sun, on hillsides carpeted with spring wildflowers. Here his parables flowed like wine, his healing touch was freely given, his laughter rang pure as temple bells.
I asked him, "Why, Lord? Why are they different up here than down there in Judea?"
"Samaritans," is what he said, and went about his business. It was not until a long time after, I learned what that meant, that they were another clan of Jews, but despised because they dare have different beliefs. That was when I realized, our Lord is working very hard to secure in the minds of soul-people the idea that freedom of speech and belief is the first and foremost of all human rights, and from there, people become people.
The very air seemed different here --- fresher, cleaner than Jerusalem's crowded streets. The Lake of Galilee stretched like polished silver in the morning light, fishing boats already out since dawn, their crews calling to each other in a dialect I was slowly learning to understand. Market days filled the air with the scent of fresh fish grilling over olive wood fires, flatbread cooking on hot stones, and the sharp tang of locally pressed olive oil. Women sold balls of fresh white cheese wrapped in grape leaves, and children ran through the crowds with handfuls of just-picked figs, their faces sticky with the sweet fruit.
Yet even here in Galilee, shadows lengthened. Spies from Jerusalem began following us, noting down his words, watching for any transgression of their Law. They were particularly incensed by how he treated women as equals, how he touched the sick whom they had declared unclean, how he spoke of God as a loving Father for all. Not only for them who say they are the "chosen" people of the God they made, the elite of the Scriptures they made. And rather than a stern judge, he spoke of God our Mother in Heaven, as the inspiration and whispers of wisdom, deep inside our souls. They hated that!
The evenings in Galilee held their own special beauty. As the heat of the day softened, women would gather at the community wells, their clay jars making hollow sounds as they filled with cool water. Their conversations mixed with children's laughter, and the distant bleating of sheep being led home. The aroma of evening meals drifted from courtyards --- lentil stew seasoned with wild herbs, fish fresh from the lake sizzling with garlic and local olive oil, the sweet scent of date honey drizzled over warm flatbread.
In Mother Mary's home, where we often stayed, the walls held the warmth of the day's sun, releasing it slowly as evening fell. She kept a small garden where mint, sage, and thyme grew alongside vegetables, the plants thriving in soil enriched by years of careful tending.
"These herbs," she told me one evening as we gathered some for dinner, "I planted when Iesous was a boy. He used to help me tend them, always asking about their healing properties." Her fingers moved surely among the plants, knowing each one by touch.
The local wine was nothing like the refined vintages of Jerusalem's wealthy. Here it was stored in clay jars, carrying the earthiness of the soil where the grapes grew on hillsides too steep for other crops. "The best grapes," a weathered vintner told me, "grow where the roots must struggle to find water. Like people," he added with a knowing look, "strength comes from overcoming difficulty."
It's a dry country, so they mix wine and bits of water to make the water safer to drink. A necessity for life in these areas. Wine and bread, with a cucumber, was lunch.
Women washing clothes by the lake would sing work songs in Aramaic, their voices carrying across the water. The rhythm of wooden beaters against wet fabric provided percussion to melodies that must have been ancient when Mary was a girl. Sometimes they would let me join them, teaching me their songs with patience and good humor, as I stumbled over the unfamiliar words. Their hands were rough from work but gentle as they showed me their technique, the importance of beating the cloth just so\... to clean without damaging.
Mother Mary took special pride in showing me how to prepare the local specialties --- the proper way to layer spices in the cooking pot, how to tell when the bread was ready for baking by the feel of the dough, the secret to preserving figs in honey for the winter months. "He always loved these," she would say, setting out a plate of honeyed figs, her eyes distant with memory. Though she never said it directly, I understood she was sharing more than recipes --- she was passing on the memories of his childhood, ensuring they would not be lost.
The local fishermen, many of whom became his followers, had their own customs and superstitions. They could read the weather in the way smoke rose from cooking fires, in the behavior of birds over the lake, in the way the light changed on the water. Their boats, built of local cedar and oak, were works of art in themselves, each plank carefully shaped and fitted by hand, the wood smoothed by generations of hands and lake water.
"Each boat has its own soul," one old fisherman explained as he mended his nets, the weathered rope rough against his calloused hands. "You must learn its ways, how it moves in different winds, how it responds to the depth of the water." His fingers never stopped moving as he talked, the net growing whole again under his practiced touch. "The Lord understands this --- how each soul is different, needs different handling. That's why we follow him. He sees what each person needs."
Yet amidst this pastoral beauty, tension simmered. The spies from Jerusalem were not the only shadow. Agents of Roman tax collectors made regular rounds, their presence a constant reminder of foreign rule. Local collaborators grew wealthy while their neighbors struggled.
Some wanted Iesous to declare himself a political messiah, to lead an uprising against Roman oppression. They couldn't understand that his revolution was of a different kind entirely.
"Can't they see?" I asked him one evening as we sat watching the sunset paint the lake in shades of gold and rose. "All this talk of war and resistance --- it's so far from what you really teach."
His smile held both love and sadness. "They see what they're ready to see, Mari. Remember how long it took for your own eyes to open fully?"
"They'll try to trap you," I warned one evening, after seeing yet another self-appointed moral police one skulking at the edge of our gathering.
"They already are," he said. He was teaching me to read the local script, his shoulder warm against mine as we bent over a scroll. "But their traps will catch only themselves in the end. They, I don't care about, its their karma, why they were born here. And they must walk that path, and save themselves. But the millions who follow their example and ideology, my heart bleeds to find a way to save them. But. Alas. People can only save themselves. All we can do is to show them a way out, but they have to take that way."
I looked at his beloved profile, gilded by lamplight. "Must it be Jerusalem?" I asked, not for the first time. "There are so many other places where teaching of theWAY flourishes."
He set the scroll aside and turned to me fully. "Mari," he said gently, "what is the greatest truth I've taught you?"
"That love is stronger than death," I answered without hesitation.
"Yes." His eyes held mine, filled with starlight and sadness and something that blazed brighter than both. "But soon I must show you how much stronger. Show everyone. What comes in Jerusalem\... it is not an ending, beloved one. It is the beginning of a new gateway."
I tried to ponder Iesous' words, but I was exhausted. I looked up to my beautiful Lord, now looking deep into the yonder skies. Then asked, "Lord, my heart is so dark. Please lighten my mind, tell me a truism I can teach people who try to make sense of every-day life. It will put my mind at rest."
The Lord smiled gently and said, "Your mind is like a skilled merchant who seeks what you tell him to find. If you send him to search for bitter herbs, he will return with arms full of wormwood and rue, proving the world is filled with bitterness. This is not because sweetness has vanished from the Earth --- it is because you commanded him to seek only bitter things."
"But consider this wisdom: if you send that same merchant to find honey and flowers, he will discover them in abundance, showing you a world rich with sweetness. Your mind serves you faithfully, gathering evidence for whatever truth you believe dwells in the world."
"This is why the wise farmer looks for signs of rain in the dry season, while the foolish one sees only dust. Both will find what they seek, for the mind is like a faithful servant - it brings back exactly what its master requests."
"So be mindful of what you ask your mind to seek. If you dwell on misfortune, it will show you endless troubles. But if you seek signs of the divine presence, moments of grace, and opportunities for growth, these too will be revealed in abundance. The world you see tomorrow grows from the seeds you plant in your thoughts today."
The evening meal was winding down, the last rays of sun painting the mountains in deep purple. Thomas had been unusually quiet, focused intently on grinding some fiery spice from his homeland into a paste.
"Not those red demons again," Peter groaned, recognizing the chilies. "My tongue still hasn't forgiven you from last time."
Thomas grinned, the mischievous expression transforming his usually serious face. "Ah, but these are special ones. From Kashmir. They say they're so hot, they'll make you see visions."
"The only vision you'll have is of your own death," Andrew muttered, but he was smiling too.
I watched the interaction with amusement. I remembered how Thomas had once convinced a group of austere Essene monks that these chilies were "purifying herbs for meditation." The resulting chaos had even the Lord himself laugh until tears ran down his face. Thomas could not have known they had never tasted a hot pepper before.
"Here," Thomas said, offering a tiny portion to Ruth on a piece of bread. "Just a taste. It builds character."
Ruth, always eager to learn, accepted before I could warn her. The effect was immediate --- her eyes widened, her face flushed, and she made a sound somewhere between a gasp and a squeak.
"Water only makes it worse," Thomas advised cheerfully as Ruth lunged for her cup. "Try some milk instead. Or better yet, surrender your soul to the fire. It's like enlightenment --- a purifying fire."
"Is that what you tell all your victims?" I asked, passing Ruth the milk pitcher.
"I learned from the best," Thomas replied, his eyes twinkling. "Remember that time in Takshashila when the Lord convinced those stern Brahmin priests that they needed to laugh more? He told them the path to liberation required at least three belly laughs a day. You told me that story yourself."
I remembered. "They thought he was joking until he proved it with scripture. Even the temple elephants seemed to be laughing that day."
"The Lord knows how to have fun," Thomas said, becoming more reflective. "People forget that about him. They think spirituality means being serious all the time. But he taught me that joy is as holy as wisdom. Even these chilies --- they remind me not to take myself too seriously."
"Is that why you offered them to that pompous merchant in Sepphoris?" Andrew asked. "The one who kept boasting about his religious devotions?"
"That was a spiritual service," Thomas said with dignity. "Nothing cures self-importance and pompous dignity quite like hopping around with your tongue on fire."
The laughter that followed was healing in its own way --- disciples and teachers sharing a simple moment of joy, the evening air filled with the scent of spices and the sound of genuine happiness.
Chapter 8
## Jerusalem
As our ministry drew closer to Jerusalem, the air itself seemed to thicken with foreboding. We traveled slowly through the towns and villages of Judea, Iesous teaching at each stop, though I noticed he spoke differently now --- with greater urgency, less in parables and more in direct challenges to those who would listen.
The crowds grew larger, more demanding. There was a desperation in the people. Desperate to get away from an oppressive religious regime, thought police, and cruel laws.
Some came seeking healing or wisdom, but others wanted revolution --- they hoped he would declare himself King of the Jews and lead an uprising against Rome and break the religious unjust. They didn't understand that his kingdom was not of this world, that he spoke of a revolution of the heart, not the sword.
"Can't they see?" I asked him one evening as we rested by a well outside Bethany. "All this talk of war and retribution, race, tribe, and politics --- it's so far from what you really teach."
He smiled that gentle smile which never failed to pierce my heart. "I told you before, you asked the same question. Soul-people see what they're ready to see, Mari. Remember how long it took for your own eyes to open fully, and you are fully awakened in spirit."
I did remember --- those first days in Chitral when I still thought him just another wandering teacher --- a wonderful man, above all else, but just another human. How gradually the truth of his nature had dawned on me, like sunrise over the mountains. "But we don't have time now for them to learn slowly," I protested. "Jerusalem is only days away."
"Time?" He laughed softly. "Mari, my beloved friend, you're thinking in human terms again. It will take them lifetimes to awaken. What's coming in Jerusalem is not an ending but a beginning. The seeds we've planted will grow for generations --- in the East, in Africa, here in Judea. You'll see\..."
But I didn't want to see a future without his physical presence. Despite all his teachings about spirit and transcendence, my human heart clung to his human form --- the warmth of his hand when he blessed the sick, the way his eyes crinkled when he laughed, how he would absently brush dust from his robe while deep in thought.
His mother Mary understood. She had joined us for this final journey, and often in the evenings we would sit together, not speaking, just watching him with the others. Sometimes she would reach for my hand and squeeze it, a gesture that said more than words could express.
Even Thomas, usually so quick with a joke, grew subdued as we neared the so-called holy city of the Jews, a city of wars and violence. One night, I found him sitting alone, staring at the distant lights of Jerusalem.
"He could stop this, you know," Thomas said without looking at me. "He has the power. I've seen him calm storms, heal the dying. Why won't he use that power now?"
"Because that would be force," I answered, understanding coming to me even as I spoke. "And force is not the way of love. To stop it by force is not theWAY of how people will learn, become wise, and change, that is how the people advance from soul to spirit --- inner change."
Thomas turned to me then, his face wet with tears. "I don't know if I'm strong enough for what's coming, Mari."
I took his hand, feeling my own tears fall. "None of us are, brother. Not alone. That's why we must hold to each other."
After a while sitting in silent self-absorption, Thomas said, "I think it's the hot peppers you get from Sepphoris, it makes our eyes tear up."
I kicked his shin and went to bed, leaving him to stare at the sky some more.
The next morning, we began the final ascent to Jerusalem. Iesous walked ahead, his steps purposeful. Sunlight caught his hair, surrounding him with a golden halo, and for a moment, again, I saw him as he truly was --- a being of pure light merely wearing human form. The vision passed, but the truth remained.
"Remember this," I told myself, trying to burn every detail into my memory. "Remember him like this, in the morning light, walking toward his destiny with such love that it will shake the foundations of the world."
The spring air was heavy with the scent of blooming almond trees as we approached Jerusalem. Along our path, blood-red anemones dotted the hillsides --- flowers we called "Solomon's crowns," though soon they would take on a more somber meaning in my mind. Birds darted overhead, their wings catching the morning light, while in the distance the great city's walls rose like a promise\... or a threat.
A man came up to the group and spoke with one of the new student teachers. He turned and left, but the student stood frozen for a long time. After a while, everyone watching, he came over and whispered to Iesous. The Lord got up and went to a quiet place to meditate and he sat there, relaxed, as if talking with a friend, having a conversation.
That's how we heard the King of the Jews had Iesous' cousin, John, killed because of some political thing, and that John and the king's wife were involved in something.
My heart went out to Mary and her family in Galilee. Iesous, he seemed to be talking more to John now, than he did in the past few years. They even shared some joke, by looks of it.
The Mount of Olives became our refuge in these last days. We would gather there in the cool of the evening, the gnarled olive trees offering shelter as Iesous taught. Their silver leaves whispered in the breeze, like countless tiny voices echoing his words. Sometimes I would press my palm against the ancient bark, drawing comfort from its weathered strength. These trees had stood here for centuries --- they would witness what was coming and live on to remember.
Even the marketplace in Jerusalem seemed to hold its breath when we passed through. The usual clamor of haggling voices would dim, then surge again in whispers. Merchants who had welcomed us before now turned away, fearing association with one whom the religious authorities had marked. Yet the common people still reached out to touch his robe as he passed, still brought their sick for healing, still hung on his every word. Still, the crowds of hearers were in record numbers.
One evening, as the setting sun painted the Temple walls in shades of fire, I found the Lord standing alone, gazing at the magnificent structure.
"Beautiful, isn't it?" he said as I approached. "Yet see how the shadows lengthen across its stones. Like time itself marking the hours until change must come."
The fading light caught the gold of the Temple's decorations, making them blaze against the darkening sky. Swallows wheeled above, their wings black against the sunset as they returned to their nests in the high walls. The air was rich with the mingled scents of incense from the Temple, cooking fires from the homes below, and the ever-present dusty sweetness of Jerusalem's limestone streets.
"I remember," I said softly, "when you first taught me about impermanence. How even the grandest temples are just temporary shelters for the spirit. But this\..." I gestured at the magnificent building before us, "this seems so solid, so eternal."
"I was speaking of the human body, being a temple for the holy spirit we put inside it. And the human body is much more magnificent that this stone building. Spirits, deities, we don't live in temples. Can you see me living in that place, day in and day out. People coming to kill poor innocent goats and sheep, bringing me the blood as a gift to appease my anger and bribe my mood? Begging me to help them get richer and win contracts, help them win in a war they started, in my name?"
He smiled, though his eyes held shadows deeper than those gathering around us. "Look well, Mari. In a generation, not one stone will stand upon another. But the truth we've taught --- that, will outlast all stones and temples. That's why we came east first, to plant the seeds in fertile soil. the WAY must have deep roots before the storm comes. The dark shadow you sense, coming for this place is not my death as much, but more\...oh so much more\... It's the karmic destruction of a million people you see all around you. They will believe the god will save them from it, but no soul-type god, can save anyone from group karma."
I was shocked to my marrow at the imagery he spoke. He is a true deity who took the human avatar for our sake. But to envisage his immensity in pure form, to envisage him even in human form sitting in the temple to receive those awful offerings... I had to snap my mind out of it, and think something beautiful to fix my energy.
A cool breeze stirred his hair, carrying with it the sweet scent of night-blooming jasmine from someone's garden. Far below, lamps were being lit throughout the city, like earthbound stars. The first evening star appeared above the Mount of Olives, bright as hope.
"When I was small," he said suddenly, "I used to watch the stars come out over Galilee and wonder if I could see Sukhavati from Earth. Now I know better --- it's not a matter of physical distance but of spiritual sight. Heaven is as close as breath, as near as love."
I wanted to preserve that moment in amber --- the deepening twilight, the glittering lamps below, his beloved profile against the darkening sky. I loved him so much. But like all moments, it slipped away into memory, carried off by the night wind that rustled through the olive trees and stirred the Temple curtains like a sigh.
Chapter 9
## Last Supper
The last supper together was both simpler and more profound than later telling would paint it. We gathered in a small upper room that smelled of fresh bread and dried herbs hanging from the rafters. Through the window, the evening star hung like a lamp in the deepening indigo sky, while below, the streets of Jerusalem hummed with Passover preparations.
Iesous broke bread with a tenderness that made my heart ache. "Never not do this," he said, "Say --- my body is the bread, salt is the soul, wine soaked into the bread is the spirit."
Iesous looked over at me. He noticed the men had pushed me to the side of the room, as they do. He called me over to him. "Mari," he said, "say it, how you taught hundreds of your disciples in the eastern lands."
I took the bread he held out to me, dipped it in the salt and the small bowl of wine, and said in my most teacher's voice, "This is our Way, sharing food with friends, being present in the simple things of life. I am in The Way, and in the love that binds us together. The WAY is in the bread that sustains you, in the salt that is like the soul, and the spirit of wine that flavors and sanctifies all, brings healing, courage and compassion."
Only Thomas smiled. He enjoyed it and probably didn't even have to learn the words. He knew what Iesous was doing there, giving me the senior role.
The candlelight caught the angles of Iesous' face, casting shadows that made him look both more human and more divine. His eyes held a depth of love that seemed to embrace not just those of us present, but all beings everywhere, across all time.
Looking at him like that, I realized. No-one knew how it would go down, but we knew what was coming. For us, the end, but the Lord said it was the beginning. He felt sad for us because it will be harder on us, and he wished he could walk that path alone, but it was not meant to be. We thought he meant the mourning. We didn't know, he saw decades into the future.
Later, when others had drifted into sleep or quiet conversation, he turned to me. "Mari," he said softly, "you know what must happen now."
I nodded, unable to speak past the tightness in my throat.
"Your work will be the hardest," he continued. "To witness, to remember, to teach others the true meaning of what comes next. They'll try to make it about death and sacrifice, but you --- you know it's about love and transformation."
"How?" I whispered. "How can I bear to watch? I will fight them..."
He took my hands in his. They were warm, callused, so humanly real. "The same way you've borne everything else --- with courage and compassion. You'll understand soon enough that death is just another gateway, and love\..." He smiled, and for a moment, his face shone with an inner light that transformed him. "Love goes both ways. It is the force that opens all gates."
Outside, a night bird called, its song pure and piercing in the darkness. The candles guttered in a sudden breeze that carried the scent of blooming jasmine from some hidden garden. Jerusalem slept, unaware that by this time tomorrow, everything would change.
In that moment, watching him in the flickering light, I finally understood what he'd been teaching all along. The event, the gateway wasn't just him being executed by the soul-people and their self-important delusions, their self-appointed status as the elite of the world, their social engineering mindset and ideology of intolerance and religion of death --- it was an opening between worlds, between ways of being. It was a new and easier path to true spirituality, an easier path to heaven.
And he would show us the way through, as he had always done, with love as our guide and compass we can follow him on theWAY. He is becoming the easy way for us to flow in the WAY.
The night deepened around us, stars wheeling overhead in their ancient dance. Soon it would be morning. Soon everything would change. But for now, in that quiet room above the sleeping city, we held onto these last precious moments of simply being together, knowing what lay ahead would reshape not just our lives, but the very fabric of reality itself.
The shadow of arrest hung over us like storm clouds gathering before a monsoon. We all knew they would come for him any moment now --- the question was only when.
I had seen this pattern before, how those who hold power use fear to control others. They are forever warning the final days are upon the people, the sky if falling, the waters are poisoned, the new Great Flood is upon us, the Great Freeze is coming, our arch enemy is about to attack us. Fear.
The temple authorities had their spies everywhere, watching our gatherings, twisting our words about freedom into accusations of sedition. Sedition, as if we must be totally loyal to the god they created and his commands that come from their priests.
"You see how it works?" Lord Iesous said one evening, his voice soft but carrying an edge of sadness. "The wealthy ones who call themselves the Elite live in comfort in Rome and Antioch while engineering the destruction of their own people, the tribe of Judah. They push them toward rebellion, to burn the city in protest, knowing Rome will respond with force. Then, when the blood has dried and the mourning is done, they will buy the land for copper coins."
I remembered similar patterns from my childhood in Magadha --- how the powerful would pit one group against another, profiting from the chaos they created. But this was different, more calculated.
These self-styled elite were sacrificing their own people, feeding them stories of divine destiny. Encouraging divine war and the Messiah will come at the last moment to save them, and take the martyrs to heaven to be rewarded with earthly pleasures, even abundant feasts, sex and virgins, in heaven, until they burned with such hatred for the "other" the non-believers, that they welcomed martyrdom.
The Lord said they have been doing it in the past, and they will continue to do it for millennia to come. It's their way.
"There were twelve tribes once," he continued, gazing into the fire. "Now only three remain. And still they haven't learned. Each tribe will start their own offshoot of the same religion, but different names. They will hate one another, just like now. They will create a new Rome, under their control. They will use our name and deceive people. The self-styled elite ride their dark horse of moral righteousness, while leading the others toward destruction. When it's done, they'll claim it was all God's will."
His words carried the weight of prophecy. We knew why they would arrest him --- not for any crime, but for daring to teach people to think freely, to question their moral and religious authority --- - teaching them to seek divine truth within their own hearts, rather than from self-appointed holy intermediaries. His real offense was showing people they could own their own mind, follow their own Path, and be free to become immortals.
I felt my heart ache, remembering how liberation had come to me in that hell cell in Srinagar. Freedom of mind, he had taught me, was the only freedom that truly mattered. Now I watched as those who claimed to speak for God, preparing to strike down one who truly did speak for God, and my soul trembled with the terrible irony of it all.
Chapter 10
## The Cross
After Iesous' arrest by the religious police, Mari and Thomas rushed to the Roman government offices to seek help. It was a long day and night. The next day, instead of an answer to intervene, she heard a barbaric commotion in the streets and rushed down there.
When Mari finally caught up with the procession, she could not believe her eyes. The religious police, now parading Iesous, had beaten him to the verge of death. His body was covered in bruises and deep cuts from their whips. He bled profusely. Iesous was a strong man, but even someone as tough as him would not last long under these conditions. She tried, but could not even catch Iesous' eye --- the Lord could not see his own feet for the swelling and blood in his eyes. He stumbled from time to time. There was no way she could speak to him above the ruckus and pushing of the horrible crowd, all too happy to join in on a torture.
Her greatest fear was the Jewish radicals would kill Iesous before she could speak with him. She knew it was all a mistake. This is not how it is supposed to be, so cruel, so degrading. She could help to fix it, but first she had to speak to the Lord. Mari was relieved to see Roman soldiers take over from the religious mob. By Roman law, they had to protect the prisoner from unnecessary abuse, and guarantee a humane execution, as best as possible under the circumstances.
Mari turned around and ran back to seek permission from the Roman governor to be allowed near the cross, a privilege reserved for family members only. She did not look her best; her hair was a mess, she was sopping wet from perspiration and her dress was dirty from running in the dew and muddy streets. But, she had to try.
After a quick wash-up in the horses' drinking trough, Mari used the names of some important people in town, sponsors of theWAY movement, to get an interview with the Roman governor. Soon, she was out of there and ran as hard as she could with her official permission in hand.
Although she ran all the way up the hill, Mari was not in time to speak to Iesous before they nailed him to the cross. They were still busy with their gruesome work when, exhausted from the run, she almost collapsed in front of the chief soldier with her note in hand. Gasping, desperate. He told her to stay back while they were working, and to come back after they had erected the pole.
From a distance, Mari watched as they drove the huge spikes through her beloved's wrists. She watched as they wrestled the cross upright and drove the stake in the ground to hold it secure.
Convicted criminals on a cross had their crime stated on a sign above them. Iesous' sign read, 'King of the Jews', the trumped-up charges of hate speech, blasphemy, and insurrection, beloved by the weakest of people in the world.
Below the hill, soldiers kept the bloodthirsty crowd at bay. Many of them were known regulars who attend every crucifixion, as a hobby of sorts. Many were professional "supporters" of a cause, any cause that needed a boisterous crowd, any funeral that needed wailing mourners ---there's money to be made. They were the moral prostitutes --- they will give their soul to the highest bidder and go yell at people. They were the punters of the Roman circus and the protestors on every cause you can dream up on a drunken night out.
They were not allowed up the hill, but as Iesous' cross went up, a roar of satisfaction sounded. Mari looked down at them; she searched and searched her heart but found nothing, no love. She had no hate, no curses, just nothing\..., as she had no feelings for her slave-owner and the men who raped and stole her childhood --- just nothing.
The officer sent for Mari when they were done, saying, "He won't last long. We would have broken his legs, to help him die sooner. But someone with influence must have arranged that they spare his bones. That's why they beat him so much, so he bleeds more. The wounds will help him to die in time. Take courage."
"In time?" asked Mari. "What do you mean in time?"
"Its some sort of Jewish thing. He must die before sunset. Tomorrow is a holy day. They want him dead by then, because their god would not approve of it otherwise."
"Their god approves of this?" Mari bit her tongue, thanked the officer, and ran up the hill to the Lord.
There was a chill in the air as she approached the cross. She could not get herself to look up at the Lord's face. A terrible cold in her heart. She feared, a cold that would be the death of her. Swollen, too big for its small space, her heart hurt. "Not today Mari, not today. Be strong now," she told herself as she approached the cross, not yet looking up. She walked up to the raw wooden pole; there was blood on the rocks below it. Thick. Iesous' blood! Large drops fell not too far from her; she resisted the urge to reach for it, to hold it.
Finally, she composed herself and tried to look up at her love, but when her gaze came to his feet, looking at the massive piece of iron driven through the bones, the blood flowed. And the flies\... The anger that Mari tried to keep at bay overcame her.
She stepped back, forced herself to look at Iesous' humiliated, naked and broken body. She said loudly, demanding almost, "My Lord, that's enough now. Get down from there. Let's go!"
Iesous did not answer. He had been watching her all the time. Although much blood crusted around his swollen eyes, and still more flowed freely from head wounds, Iesous looked at Mari with more compassion, more love than she had ever seen in him.
"He hurts, for my sake\...Oh, God, this is too much\...," her knees buckled. She held on to the cross and started to cry, "You said, Lord. After this, its Egypt. Are we going now, Lord? The sisters, Isis Temple, we should go there for a while. They will give us safety, and rest. We are so tired. I watched you. You have been losing weight. You work too much."
She stepped back and looked in the Lord's face, saying through the tears. "Egypt should be nice this time of year\... You said, when we are done here, I would enjoy the island so much."
Iesous interrupted her, it was hard for him to speak since his mouth was dry and the wounds, "\...we have work\... to do\... here. When done\... go down\... to the island\... rest\..."
The soldier in charge, who watched closely, stepped forward with a wetted sponge of wine and herbs, and held it up for Iesous to drink.
"And you?" said Mari, not able to stop the flood of tears. "Lord, where will you go?" It was such a relief to hear him talk and speak of the future; she almost laughed from relief.
"I will tell you\...but first\... this body, must die."
"Then where will you go?" asked Mari, alarmed.
"Sukha\...vati," said Iesous.
"I'll go with you. Don't leave me here!" said Mari as she looked around for something to kill her body.
"Mari!" said Iesous in his stern voice. She jumped in fright, and calmed down. "Trust me. \...a few\... more hours. All will be well," he said, looking deep into her soul with those blue eyes that drove demons of worry and bad thoughts away. He sent her peace, and she accepted him in her soul, like so many times before.
She closed her eyes and savored his peace. "God. How will I ever exist without that? I never want to live without that beauty. I wilt when he is not near me. I am nothing without him," she thought.
When Mari had composed herself, Iesous said, "My, shadow, look." Mari looked at the shadow of the pole. It was late afternoon, the shadow extended, a cross with a tortured human being nailed to it. An awful picture. She looked up at the Lord, puzzled, questioning.
Through the pain and lack of air in his lungs, his words came slowly, "Yantra. The crossroads of decision\...sign of free will," Iesous tried to cough but the pain from broken ribs, and his extended arms prevented it. He was slowly suffocating; needed more breath to speak.
He tried again, "Life is full of opportunities, have the freedom to choose the way to turn. That is the symbol. Freedom of thought and speech."
Mari heard, but all she could think was the horror, and recalled Iesous saying, "In the actions of a god's devotees, you see the heart of the god."
Mari pleaded with him again, "My Lord, it was not supposed to be like this. Come down here, walk away with me. I know you can. Mahasthamaprapta, she can help, Lord. She can help, your Moonlight sister --- just ask."
Abha Father, or our Mother, they can help. Together we will create beautiful yantra images all over the world. You don't have to do this! What will that yantra mean? And who will ever want to look upon such an image! An image of a tortured divine man suffering on a cross! killed by someone's god, It's so cruel\..." She cried again, wiping his blood from the rocks with her shawl. It was too much for her to see the one she loves in such pain.

Chapter 11
## "Eli heli bhagajati homa"
Over the next few hours, Mari sat at the foot of the cross crying and watching how the strong man became weaker. She wanted to clean his wounds, wash his feet, give him something to drink, cook a nice meal --- but she was not allowed.
Mother Mary and her sister arrived. His mother gained permission from the senior soldier to approach the cross. She gently touched Iesous' feet and looked up at him. Tender, as she used to when she fed him.
Iesous smiled at her through the wounds and blood. She smiled back, tears streaming down her cheeks. Mari watched, and realized that although her own relationship with Iesous was unique and deeply special, there was something more profound happening there, between mother and child.
She thought, "Mary understands things from a different perspective than I. She sees the big picture, the true Reality. I, I am focused on the ministry." Those observations gave Mari some peace, some hope to cling to. She knew things would work out well, she trusted, but she could not see it, could not understand the cruelty.
"It is too easy to hate the people of this god," she thought.
Together, the three women waited, watching. "We are waiting for him to die. It feels wrong\...," said Mari after a while, into the silence. Mother Mary held her hand and tried to sound reassuring, "He is still losing blood, it won't be long."
The next moment Mari looked up, was when Iesous coughed again. And she saw, clearly saw, how the deities of Sukhavati were all around the Lord. She saw Gautama Buddha, Lord Krishna, Lao Tzi, and others she did not recognize. Clear as day, there they were. And all that came to mind was, "Heaven came here to judge these people and their god, for what they did to one of their own."
Mari got up and was about to prostrate to the gods of heaven, to beg them for help, but realized neither the soldiers nor Mary and her sister saw it.
She looked up at Iesous, and saw that he knew, they were there all along. Mari greeted each with her namaste, to each and all.
Iesous could do a small smile, happy that she could see them. She could only trust they would do what was right.
Hours, that felt like days later, when evening finally rolled in, Iesous knew the time was right.
He lifted his head, opened his eyes and readied himself to speak. "Mother\...," he said, first in a whisper, then tried again, "Mother this is your daughter. Mari, your mother." His mother nodded and put her arm around Mari.
Iesous looked at Mari. Her suffering touched him deeply. He prayed to Sukhavati. Then, raising his torso for breath, he said lines of a poem for her in Sanskrit. But it came one by one, he needed to gather all his strength, and air in his lungs, to say a line. The three lines were:
> "ehi ila rame śabdaya cittāni"\
> "ehi elaya ramaya śabdāt cittāni"\
> "ehi elaya rame sabhāṃ ca atāni"
The meaning of it is:
> Come, be calm, delight the hearts by teaching the Word.\
> Come, be calm dear, show and speak to the hearts.\
> Come, be calm dear, I shall always wander amongst the assembly.
One of the Roman soldiers whispered, "I think he prayed in Aramaic to his god El."
Mother Mary and her sister were puzzled by the strange language. "What did he say?" Mother Mary whispered, leaning over to Mari, "Do you know?"
Mari stuttered, she was flustered. Too many things\... a peace came over her and a deep insight filled her soul, but\..., "I\...mother\...I don't know, not yet."
When the next line came, his mother asked again, more urgently this time, "Mari, what did he say? Sounds the same as before?"
"Not exactly the same, mother. Similar sounds, alliteration, different words, different meaning\..." Mari's mind rushed. She wrestled her emotions away from the moment.
Iesous was a master at Sanskrit. She remembered her lucid mind while studying, her training in the mountains with Iesous, his poetry, his love of word-play with Sanskrit.
Then came the third line, and she knew. "It's a poem! He is saying a poem, mother! My Lord is saying a poem with layers of meaning: We must be calm. We must show theWAY in our behavior. We must teach it in their hearts. We must delight their hearts by teaching the Logos. The Divine Feminine. We must be calm. He will always be with us when we assemble."
The Lord lifted his head again and looked at his mother for a long time. She looked back at him, holding his gaze; his swollen mouth blew a kiss to her. Slowly, she lifted her hand and waved. Then he looked at Mari, smiled, and said, "It is done." His human body died.
The wealthy benefactor who had arranged for Iesous' bones to not be broken, sent workers to quickly remove the body from the cross after he had died. They rushed to wash him and laid his body to rest in a private burial cave before dark. The Jewish Law got what they wanted, removing the "competition", even to the last minute, all was fulfilled.
Mari stared, her mind gone blank. In her inner self, she whispered, "And now, it starts." Her soul crushed, fighting the anger, hatred, the disgust, desperately seeking for holy calm. And then, she opened her eyes and saw the holy ones from Sukhavati watching over Iesous, and her.
Chapter 12
## At the Tomb
Mari remained at the grave. Not having grown up there, she had nothing to lose. Her family would not suffer infamy from being associated with a convicted blasphemer and insurrectionist, and she had no ritual obligations on Passover.
The city was quiet that night because of the holy day. Mari was very tired. It was the most traumatic day of her life, and her beloved lay dead in a grave.
She held on to a glimmer of hope, the trust she had in her Lord was all she had\... nothing else. She wiped perspiration from her brow and noticed there was blood on her sleeve. "Iesous' blood," she whimpered. "On Passover. Innocent blood, as a sign for the angels to not kill the first born of that household...! How cruel these people and their gods are in the west\..." Mari cried herself to sleep.
When she opened her eyes again, there was a light-being sitting in meditative posture in front of her. "Don't be frightened child," it said, "I come in peace."
Mari was more than frightened. She could hardly get her mouth to say a word, "Who\...what are you? What do you want?" Mari thought, "Is the Jewish Lucifer God coming for me because I am weak? Because the Lord is not here to protect me?"
She struggled to get up; her leg had gone to sleep. She was about to run when the light being said in Magadhi, her home language, "You must write something, I will tell you about a meeting in Sukhavati, you write it. Send it to Gilgit, to the Brotherhood of White Light. This is what our Father wants."
Mari said, "Show yourself if you are true. How do you know my language?" Before her eyes, slowly, the light changed dimmer and the figure of a monk in robes became apparent.
He said, "I was a monk once, as you are now, now I am a buddha, as you will be. Come, write."
"With what, Lord? I did not bring\..."
"In your hand child," said he. Mari's hands trembled. Around her was what she needed to write and the glow from the angel's being provided light for her eyes to see. The light guided her hands and filled her mind. 'Thus Have I Heard,' she wrote the first line, and the words flowed from her pen as if coming out of nowhere. She could not even comprehend the meaning of the words because they were put into her and flowed right out onto the parchment. It was as if she were taking notes of a meeting of the Council of Heaven. The Father, many Buddhas, spiritual beings talking, discussing. There was concern about humans and their spirituality. There was word of a coming universal gateway of enlightenment, savior of the world, a deity who appears as all deities to anyone.
When the Buddha had finished, he said, "The next person you meet. Give the books, and tell her to send it." At that, Mari seemed to wake up. It was mid-day; the sun was high. Mari thought she had been busy for only a little while. She checked the cave, it was still sealed. Packets of parchment were stacked around her --- written in her own hand, in her own language. She gathered the books, wanting to read it; when she noticed Mother Mary coming down the pathway toward her.
She remembered the instruction to send it away with the next person --- "was it, could it be Mary," she thought. "No, cannot be. How would she be able to...," then she remembered the buddha said, 'tell her to send it'. It was her!
Mary carried bread and food tied in a large cloth. She was instantly worried about Mari, who looked worse for wear, as if she did not sleep a wink. Concerned, she said, "Come child. It is over. Let's go home."
She said, "You really must rest. Look at you! You didn't sleep at all? You need a bath."
Mary sat down and opened the cloth. "Oh," said she, holding a large salmon-colored flower out to Mari, "your friend said I should give it you, he would bring it, but he had to be somewhere else in a hurry."
Mari held the flower, perplexed she said, "My friend?"
Mother Mary broke bread, "The bald fellow up the path, he was right there\...," she pointed with a loaf of bread over her shoulder. "What is it? The flower, what sort of flower is it? I haven't seen them around here?" asked Mother Mary as she prepared the meal.
"It is a lotus flower mother," said Mari, staring at it. "I don't think they grow around here. Last one I saw was near the harbor, before we left India."
"Well, let's eat and go home. You cannot sit here. It is over. We have to continue; have to go on. The last thing Iesous would want, is for us to sit here and pine."
"It is not over, mother. I know the man in that grave. It's not over. I am waiting."
"What are you talking about child?"
"Mother, I know him. He has too much compassion to leave us like this, the job unfinished. When his heart sees a child wronged, even the angels in heaven feel his pain. I tell you mother; this is not over. This is the beginning\..."
Mother Mary did not understand, but she discerned well enough. Ever since the angel said that her baby would be a spiritual being sent from heaven, she had learned to accept things she did not understand. She also appreciated that Mari was more enlightened than what she was. She leaned over, put her arm around Mari\... the best she could do under the circumstances.
"What are you writing? Look! You have ink all over your dress," she said, trying to blot the ink away with her cloth.
Mari said, "The man with the lotus flower\..."
"What about him?"
"He, he's is an angel mother. He said I must tell you to send this sutra to the School of Translation in the mountain. Do you know how to do it?"
Mary looked behind her to where she last saw the man. Slowly she said, "An angel, like 'that'?" Mari did not answer.
After about a minute, Mother Mary went into a bit of a panic. "All right then. Put the books in the cloth; knot it up nicely. Here, let me help you. I will leave the food with you, there's a small sweet bread. The ones you like. And a dried fish from Galilee. I remember you said they taste like the fish in Kashmir. You stay if you need to my child, as long as it takes\..." She was rambling, her mind racing. "Now don't let the ants get into your food. You know how they come for the sweet things. Yes, pack them all in. Careful\..."
Mari put her hand on Mother Mary's arm to stop her. Then pulled her closer and hugged her, held her tight.
Mother Mary knew. Since the birth of Iesous, she received a visitor every month. Not always the same person, sometimes a man, other times a woman. For thirty years now, every month. They bring news of Iesous and money from the wealthy benefactors who helped her and Joseph and baby Ieosous escape to Egypt. They paid for his education and his travels. They, any one of them, can get the angel's book to the Translation School and the Brotherhood that Mari mentioned. She knew, because they have mentioned those names before. But Mother Mary was falling apart. It was all too much to bear.
Mari said soothingly, "It will be all right, Mother. It is not over. The Father is with us, Mother God is watching over us. Angels are among us, taking care of things. This is only the beginning. One day, soon, there will be peace. Just a little while, just a little longer. Let's sit together and eat lunch with Iesous, we haven't had time to do that, you know, it has been a long time, we could sit with him like this."
And so, Mari and Mary had lunch with Lord Jesus on Passover at the grave.
Chapter 13
## "To You, Resplendent Light Father"
On the third day after Iesous' burial, early in the morning, Mother Mary brought food, fresh clothes, and some water for Mari to wash. It was a misty Spring morning. She watched her step on the slippery little path to the cave. Mari came up to meet her and take the load from her.
Hardly had they sat down and opened the food parcel, when a noise.
The huge rock in front of the cave made crunching sounds, plaster broke free from the cemented sides and slowly, it rolled sideways. There, in the misty morning light, stood Iesous with two bright angels.
"Do you see it mother?" asked Mari in a hushed voice, double-checking to make sure it is not her imagination.
"Yes, I see," whispered Mary. "Do you see the angels\...?" she whispered, looking up ahead in awe.
"Yes," Mari said. Mother Mary gripped her arm and beamed at her. Mari saw that Mary's soul had been illuminated. For her to see light beings with her human eyes, means she will be reborn in Sukhavati.
Mari jumped up and ran toward the Lord. However, he indicated to her not to come closer.
He said to the women, "Don't touch me yet, this body is not ready for that, but go and gather the teachers in Olive Grove, we need to talk."
Mari ran back to Mother Mary, kissed her on the mouth, and hugged her. Through the tears, she could hardly see anything. "I will be back for you Mother!"
She ran into the city to where the Wayists were doing morning meditations. Like a child in a park, she ran, announcing to anyone and everyone, "The Lord is alive! Alive! He wants to talk to you!" People thought she had gone crazy.
Many Wayist teachers had gathered, waiting for the Lord. Others were still on their way, but Iesous appeared to each and every one at the same instant, no matter where they were, or what they were doing.
He said, "I have to go away for a little while, but I made a vow to Abha Father to come back and remain with you until the last one on Earth is enlightened. As for you, I have seen the future of this place. This land and its people will be ruined because of the extremes in their hearts."
You should go away in all directions, to all the nations, and teach theWAY. Lead your ministries by teaching and healing, and teach about medicines and energy healing. Thomas, you go to Kashmir and prepare a place for people of theWAY from here. Those not welcomed in other lands, will be welcomed in Kashmir.
You will see many religions going through reformations in the time to come, many sects will come and go, and false religions will try to undo our work. Tell them, theWAY is the foundation of all good spirituality. This is theWAY they must incorporate.
However, you will know those that oppose theWAY, for they cannot hide lack of love, pompous piety, and greed. They will teach of gods complicated and illogical. They will speak of love, but they will not be able to fake, for love is a verb. Tell the world, because many are ready for the Truth."
Later in the day, Iesous appeared only to those assembled in Olive Grove. A Wayist teacher from Rome asked in the Aramaic language, "Lord, how will we learn the language of strange countries, and how will we know where to go?"
Iesous said, "What language did you now speak?" The teacher spoke again and realized that a different language came from his lips. Another came forward and said, "I hear him". Yet another exclaimed, "I understand what he is saying. He's speaking my home language!" A commotion broke out as the group learned that each could speak a foreign language well enough to have a basic conversation. That day, Moonlight, in Sukhavati, worked hard.
Iesous said, "Now you know where to go, and you also know that you are never alone, a holy spirit accompanies you, you have a companion."
He continued, "I have teachers and devotees of theWAY in many places you dont know about. I speak these things to all. At once, I speak to you all. Be careful. Some will come and say, He appeared to me and made me a teacher of theWAY. They will change what I taught. What I taught is not in books, its in hearts. But they will add it to their own holy books and claim me as authority. But the fruits of their works will show. A deity's heart is reflected in their people."
Andrew said, "Lord, if you are going away, how will we know how to act, and what to do?"
Iesous said, "Look inside you, the energies of Source from the Absolute is closer to you than your hand. Your spirit within, is from our Father in Heaven. You have a little bit of heaven in your spirit-minds. Follow it. The Way flows through all; it is The Way of the universe. Find its rhythm and flow with it. Say, 'I am The Way, which is the Truth, and the way of life.' I tell you, no one comes to the Father but through harmonizing with The Way."
Peter said, "Lord, when you are not with us, shall we meditate differently, how do we pray to you? As leaders, we are responsible for praying on behalf of our households, how will we know?"
"Peter. You stand at the crossroad, facing the sign of the cross. Soon you will know which way your soul shall turn. But, for now because you are still struggling, learn from Mari. Spiritual children on Earth pray for perfection of wisdom. Mari can teach you the dharani in the Sanskrit, but for now, use this prayer," answered Iesous.
Upon that, Iesous said to her, "Mari, teach the elders the Nectar Dharani, not many have had opportunity to learn it."
Mari stepped forward into the group, sat down and assumed the meditative position, indicating for the senior teachers to follow her example.
Everyone complied, except Peter; he was reluctant to sit as a student before Mari. When Iesous noticed that, something he had been waiting for, he too sat before Mari in the student position. Peter followed.
Mari said, "First, I recite in Sanskrit. You repeat. We do this three times for your learning. After that, I will recite in Greek."
She closed her eyes, breathed, and slowly a glow, a tangible serenity came from her.
After a few minutes, she sang in an angelic voice that entranced her audience:
namo amitābhāya pandara-jananyai
tathāgatāya tathāgatyai
tadyathā
amṛtodbhave amṛta-jananyai
amṛtasiddhibhāvāya
amṛtavikrāntaye
amṛtavikrānta-gāmine gāminyai
gagana-kṛta-kare
svāhā
amṛtadundubhisvare
sarvakarmakleśakṣayaṅkare
svāhā
After the prayer, Mari said, "Now, we sing the translation, as our Lord teaches the prayer of Abha Father, we call it: 'Homage to You, Resplendent Light Father and Moon Light Mother'"
"We give Homage.
To God our Bright Light Father, and God our Moon Light Mother in heaven,
To the Ones who go thus in both radiant and gentle forms,
And thus we pay homage:
To the Source of nectar and the Mother who births it,
To the state of nectar's perfection,
To the path to victory and immortality,
To the Guide and Guidess on the deathless path,
To the Ones who create space for us in heaven,
Svaha!
To the Ones whose words are the immortal sound,
To the destroyers of all Karmic afflictions,
Svaha!"
Chapter 14
## Mari's ministry in Judea
Months turned into years. The teachers of theWAY were all over the world.
The numbers of People of theWAY in Jerusalem and Galilee increased significantly. The teachings are simple, humble, and compassionate. Easy to carry in one's heart, easy on the mind, and it needs no external symbols.
But things in Jerusalem brewed a great violence in the hearts of the people. The religious and political leaders could not stop themselves and they taxed people to death, and little money flowed back into the communities. As hatred for "the other" grew in Jerusalem, so did poverty.
Already the Jews had executed several other People of theWAY. Some extremists even said that the Lord appeared to them in a vision and told them he wants to be the Messiah of the Jews. That he repented and claimed his place as a Jew in the Judaic cult.
Mari and the other, of course knew better and saw it for what it was, a hijack of a growing movement they think to use for their own gain. But Peter. He seemed to be going with those people who made of theWAY a Judaic reform movement, under the same god and same scriptures.
But, the Lord had mentioned this would happen and so it also happened in India among the Buddhists, and Zoroastrians in Parthia. There is reform, and when it becomes popular, the potential for mind control and profit calls the soul-people with loud trumpets they cannot resist.
For Mari. The evening breeze carried the scent of desert sage as she gathered with her followers on the outskirts of Jerusalem. That evening, they met in a humble courtyard, its worn stones still warm from the day's sun. Women brought their children, who played quietly in the shadows while their mothers learned the sacred mantras. The soft murmur of Sanskrit, Armenian, and Greek hymns mingled with the call of doves nesting in the eaves above.
Mari's voice, melodious and clear, guided them through the ancient wisdom: "See how the setting sun paints everything in gold? That same divine light dwells within each of you, waiting to be recognized." Her dark eyes, bright with inner fire, moved from face to face as she spoke. The women nodded, their own eyes shining with understanding.
Her followers were mostly non-Jews from various religious backgrounds. The men of Judea would not allow their wives to attend, but some did so, secretly.
In these gathering twilight hours, Mari would often speak of her time with Iesous in the East. Her words painted vivid pictures of snow-capped mountains, vast deserts crossed by camel caravans, and temples where wisdom had been preserved for centuries. But always she brought the teaching back to the present moment, to the divine presence that could be found in a child's laugh, a mother's touch, a morsel of bread shared with the hungry.
The poorest quarters of Jerusalem became her special ministry. There, in the narrow alleys where the air hung heavy with the smell of poverty, she taught simple healing practices. Her hands, strong and sure from years of work, would guide others in preparing healing herbs and poultices. "The Creator's pharmacy grows wild on every hillside," she would say, pointing out humble plants that could ease suffering.
At night, after her students had returned to their homes, Mari would climb to the flat roof of her dwelling. There, under a canopy of stars, she would look toward Sirius and speak to her beloved teacher. Sometimes tears would trace silent paths down her cheeks as she remembered the terrible day of his crucifixion, but more often a gentle smile would play about her lips as she sensed his continuing presence.
"The time grows short," she would whisper to the night air. "I can feel it in the tension that grips the city, see it in the faces of the Roman soldiers who patrol with increasing frequency. Soon we must leave this place, just as you foretold. But first, my Lord, let me prepare as many hearts as possible for the destruction what is to come."
The summer heat lay heavy over Jerusalem like a wool blanket, but it did not deter those who sought Mari's teaching in these times when the people's energies were filled with anxiety and fear of a non-existent enemy. They would rile up one group against another, families against one another. The social engineers in charge of the politics got what they wanted --- a people ready to revolt. Soon, they would have an important city in ruins and all the property would be available --- property will be bought at a fraction of its value --- as if almost stolen from those left without choices.
Mari and her folk gathered in the relative cool of early morning, in a small garden where fig trees offered blessed shade. The sweet scent of ripening fruit mingled with the herbs Mari had planted --- mint, rosemary, and healing plants brought from distant lands.
"Remember," Mari would say, her fingers trailing through the fragrant leaves, "these plants teach us about theWAY. Also, your soul exchanges energies with their souls. Just a touch, is an exchange. Here, feel for yourself. See how they offer their gifts freely, asking nothing in return. They demonstrate the simplicity and generosity that should mark our own lives."
Word of Mari's wisdom spread, carried by merchant caravans and whispered in marketplaces. Women especially sought her out, drawn by stories of a teacher who spoke of divine love accessible to all, regardless of gender or status. Some travelled for days, bringing offerings of bread, sandals, cloth, or coins.
The women who were connected to Mari in her sphere of influence took it upon themselves to ensure the financial stability of her ministry. Generous widows contributed funds and preserved foods to aid the less fortunate and provide teachers with personal items, scrolls, and clothing.
One morning, as the first light touched the Temple mount, a group of wealthy women from the upper city came to her. Their silk robes rustled as they settled on the garden benches, unused to such humble surroundings.
"We have heard you speak of the divine feminine," their spokesperson said, her jeweled fingers twisting nervously. "Our husbands say this is dangerous talk."
Mari smiled, her face serene. "Tell me," she asked, "when you hold your newborn child, does the love that fills your heart feel dangerous? When you comfort the sick or feed the hungry, is that power to heal and nurture something to fear? These are divine gifts, flowing through the feminine aspect of heaven. And, from the Source of all energies, there flows a feminine aspect necessary for all things in creation. Nothing under the sun has either male of female qualities, all share in portions, some more some less, but we all have both male-like and female-like energies."
As she spoke, a mother pigeon landed nearby, feeding her chicks with patient dedication. The women watched, understanding dawning in their eyes.
But dark clouds were gathering. News came of increased tension between the Jewish zealots and Roman authorities, and the political authors of the crisis, did many subtle things to fuel it.
Mari began preparing her followers for the exodus she knew must come. Already property prices were way down. People had lost their life savings. Authorities were clamping down even more on freedom of speech and freedom to gather --- all in the name of public safety.
In the cool of evening, Mari would teach practical skills --- how to find safe water, identify edible plants, treat common ailments. Her own experiences as a traveler over many countries, sleeping and eating rough, served now to help others who would soon walk similar paths.
"theWAY is not bound to any one place," she would remind them. "We carry it in our hearts, and where we go, it goes with us. The same stars that shine over Jerusalem shine also over Damascus, Alexandria, and the distant mountains of the East."
The women listened and watched, understanding dawning in their eyes. The signs were clear to those with eyes to see: Jerusalem's time of reckoning was approaching.
Chapter 15
## Peter and the Christians
The afternoon sun cast long shadows through the narrow streets as Mari made her way to a family's home, a family with a sick child not responding to medicine. The mother's desperate eyes had sought her out in the marketplace that morning, and Mari could never turn away from suffering. As she walked, she noticed how the crowds parted around her --- some with reverence, others with suspicion. She had grown used to such reactions, remembering how Iesous had faced the same.
The child lay fevered on a thin pallet, the small room heavy with worry and the sharp smell of illness. Mari knelt beside her, one hand gently on the burning forehead while the other sought the herbs in her medicine pouch. The mother hovered nearby, twisting a corner of her shawl.
"But the priests say\..." the woman began hesitantly, "they say women shouldn't heal with energies. That it's not natural."
Mari's hands remained steady as she mixed the healing tea. "Tell me," she said softly, "when your child hurts, who does she cry for first? Whose touch brings the most comfort? The Divine Mother gave us these gifts of healing --- to deny them would be the truly unnatural thing."
As she worked, Mari felt the familiar presence of her angels, guiding her hands. The child's breathing gradually eased, her small face relaxing into a peaceful sleep. Looking up, Mari saw tears of relief streaming down the mother's face.
Later that evening, as her students gathered for instruction, Peter arrived unexpectedly. He stood awkwardly at the edge of the group, his weathered face troubled. Mari continued teaching, but kept him in her peripheral vision, reading the internal struggle in his stance.
"The Lord taught us that truth flows like water," she was saying, "finding its way past all obstacles. It cannot be contained by any one vessel, any one tradition." She paused, meeting Peter's eyes. "Even now, it works its way through the cracks in our preconceptions, washing away what must go."
Peter shifted uncomfortably, then finally spoke, "The men's assembly\... they say you don't teach baptism, only the dayspring ritual, and you concentrate on healing. That is not our way, they say it causes confusion."
A soft evening breeze stirred the air, carrying the scent of night-blooming jasmine. Mari smiled, remembering how Iesous had faced similar accusations. "Truth often appears as confusion to those who resist it," she said gently. "But tell me, Peter --- when you see these people's lives transformed by love, their hearts opened to divine wisdom, do you truly believe this is wrong? When you see these people's fear transformed into peace and joy, do you believe this is wrong?"
Peter didn't answer. His demeanor was of one who had already made up his mind about his truth, and that included his long-held animosity for Mari and her group of women followers.
"Peter, you live in fear they will arrest you for not being Jewish. You and your friends prefer religion with structure and codes of conduct. It must be hard for you, theWAY. I, on the other hand, I have a clean slate, I teach the exact teaching the Lord gave us, word for word and concept for concept. I have no reason to fear. Unlike you, I have no wife, children, or family to consider. I believe your heart desires a sacred building, such as a temple, for worship, and you disagree with Iesous's teaching, what Stephen said to the Sanhedrin on avoiding grand buildings to prevent idolatry. You are a Jew at heart, Peter," said Mari, leaving it to hang there.
The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken things. In that moment, Mari felt great compassion for Peter and the others, who struggled to bridge the old ways and the new. Change never came easily, especially to those who had invested their whole lives in a particular view of truth.
After a while, Peter just standing there, with animosity boiling, his energies fuming at her, she said, "Peter, why don't you just go and join that Paul fellow, the one who founded the community of the Messiah? He wants to incorporate some of the Lord's teaching into a new Jewish religion. You will have the same God of wrath and war than before. They say he needed the smell of innocent blood sacrificed to him or else he would kill all humans, so as a kindness to us, he tortured his son on a cross, so that the blood appease his own needs. I was there, I had that blood on my hands, Peter. And, did you notice, Paul's people, they celebrate the crucifixion more than the resurrection? Perhaps that's where you want to be, Peter. Would that not put your soul at rest? theWAY is not for everyone, some are not ready yet."
Peter was visibly shaken. He went pale. He was reminded again why he despised the woman so much.
Mari never did see Peter again after that evening, not even at the meetings with Andrew and the two other elders. Only a few individuals who walked with the Lord remained in Jerusalem. All the rest, except Stephen, who was murdered by that Paul, now work as teachers in foreign countries.
"As soon as I can, I am out of here. This city is gnawing at my spirit," said Mari to herself as she watched Peter walk away, and symbolically shaking the dust of her yard, from his feet.
A shaft of morning sunlight illuminated the dust motes in Mari's small room as she carefully rolled the completed manuscript. Her fingers, stained with ink, traced the characters she had written with such care.
Outside, the first stirrings of Jerusalem's daily life began --- women's voices at the well, the bleating of sheep being led to market, a child's laughter carrying on the wind.
She struggled with the last piece of her book, The Good News of The Way. Ironically, that last piece was the opening line. She read it for the hundredth time. "In the beginning of creation was the Logos, and the Logos was The Way, and The Way was from the Absolute. And the one I love, is one with the energies of The Way," she read. "Oh," she said to herself, "I have written and rewritten that intro so many times. Try again tomorrow\..."
She looked out the windows to the dusty streets and the poverty. A scraggly chicken scratched in the dust. Mari smiled, remembering how Ruth had rescued that chicken from the market last week, arguing that it was alive and looked at her, and all life was precious. But the chicken meat ... didn't look at her.
The girl had been her constant companion these past three years, ever since she'd appeared at one of Mari's teachings in Galilee. Something about the young woman's fierce intelligence and unflinching questions had reminded Mari of herself at that age.
Though barely fifteen then, Ruth carried herself with the gravity of someone who had seen too much, too young. Her dark curls and olive skin marked her as Galilean, but her Greek was flawless --- a gift from her merchant father who had seen the value in educating his daughter before the self-appointed moral police, the Judeans, took his life because he reasoned with them in favor of theWAY.
"So much to tell," Mari murmured, "and yet words can never fully capture what we lived, what we saw." She thought of Iesous' face in the firelight during their travels, the way his eyes would sparkle when sharing profound truths through simple parables, the quiet strength he showed even in his darkest hours.
A soft knock interrupted her reverie. It was Ruth, her face tight with worry. Her usually bright eyes were shadowed with concern, the sage green shawl she always wore pulled close around her shoulders as if for protection. "They are gathering more weapons," she reported in a low voice\...
Even farming equipment had become weapons. Plough shears are cut and made into swords. They say the time for action approaches. And the Romans\..." she hesitated, "they're arresting anyone they suspect of causing unrest, anyone who thinks differently."
Mari nodded, unsurprised. She had felt the growing tension in the city like a gathering storm. That morning's market had been unusually quiet, with many stalls empty and shopkeepers speaking in worried whispers.
"Tell our people to prepare," she instructed Ruth. "Pack only what they can carry easily. Keep food and water ready. When the time comes, we must move quickly. Oh, and do tell them they can also go with the other groups. Some are going East, to Parthia and Kasmir. We are going to Egypt."
As Ruth turned to go, Mari called her back. "And Ruth\... remember what the Lord taught us about fear. It is like a shadow --- powerful when it looms over us, but powerless in the light of truth."
That evening, as the setting sun painted Jerusalem's walls in shades of amber and rose, Mari gathered her closest students. They met in the olive grove where Iesous had often taught. The ancient trees standing like silent witnesses to yet another turning point in the eternal story.
"The way ahead will not be easy," she told them, her voice carrying clearly in the evening stillness. "But neither was it easy for our Lord. Remember how he faced his challenges --- not with weapons of steel, but with the sword of truth; not with hatred, but with boundless love."
A young mother in the group clutched her infant closer. "Where will we go?" she asked, fear evident in her voice.
Mari's answer was interrupted by the distant sound of shouting, followed by the clangs of metal on metal. The tension that had been building for months was finally breaking into violence.
"South," Mari said firmly. "To Egypt first, where the Sisters of Isis will shelter us. Then, for some, further still --- to places where theWAY can take root and flourish anew. The Lord has prepared the path before us. We are travelers, not runaways and not refugees --- so act like travelers and not like victims. We are on a pilgrimage to our freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and freedom to be. "
As darkness fell, the refugees, sorry, travelers, began arriving at their predetermined meeting place, carrying small bundles and wearing faces marked by equal measures of fear and determination. Mari moved among them, offering comfort here, practical advice there, her presence a steady anchor in the chaos of their world falling apart. "Change your attitude, I want to see and feel the pilgrim traveler in you, the one excited and prepared for the adventure --- break the energy of victim and refugee. Whoever asks, tell them, 'were going on a pilgrimage to Philae'. We eat our sadness in the shadows, not in public," was the main message they all received.
Chapter 16
## Leaving Jerusalem
In the predawn darkness, Mari, now an elderly woman, divided the refugees into small, innocuous looking groups, and they took different routes out of the city. The soft padding of their feet on stone mingled with the occasional cry of a night bird.
Women clutched children close, men carried what few possessions they'd been able to gather. Mari had seen this before --- the haunted look of refugees, the mixture of grief and hope in their eyes. Her own heart ached for what they were leaving behind, yet she knew with certainty that this was the path they must take.
They passed through the city gate just as the eastern sky began to pale. The Roman guards, either sympathetic or well-bribed, looked away as the small groups moved like shadows into the surrounding countryside. The morning air was cool and sweet with the scent of wild herbs crushed beneath their feet.
"Look," Mari whispered to a crying child, pointing to where the morning star still gleamed bright above the horizon. "Even in darkness, light guides our way."
They traveled through the day, keeping to less-traveled paths, resting in the shade of olive groves when the sun grew too fierce. Mari taught them as they walked --- how to find water, which plants could heal, how to read the stars for direction. More importantly, she taught them how to keep their spirits strong.
"Remember," she would say during their brief rest stops, "we carry the most precious things within us --- our love, our wisdom, our connection to the Divine. These cannot be taken from us."
Near sunset, they heard the distant sound of marching feet --- a Roman patrol, perhaps, or bands of zealots. The groups pressed close together in a shallow wadi, scarcely daring to breathe. A mother pressed her hand over her infant's mouth, tears streaming down her face. Mari moved among them, touching each shoulder, each bowed head, transmitting calm through her presence.
"We need weapons," said a young man as she passed by.
Mari smiled, "We don't need weapons, we have protection," she said, pointing to the rising moon and the wondrous starry skies, then to his heart.
When the danger had passed, they continued under the rising moon. Its silver light transformed the landscape into something otherworldly, and Mari was reminded of nights in the Himalayan mountains, where the boundary between earth and heaven seemed to blur.
"Mother," Ruth whispered, walking close beside her, "what will become of those we left behind?"
Mari was quiet for a moment, feeling the weight of responsibility for all these lives. "Some will find their way to us later," she finally said. "Others will carry the teaching forward in their own ways. The seed of truth, once planted, grows in unexpected places and saves many lives."
As they crested a hill, the first glimmer of dawn touched the eastern horizon. Mari paused, allowing the others to pass her. She turned for one last look at the distant Jerusalem, its walls catching the first rays of sun. How many times had history repeated itself --- people fleeing, carrying their truth and their dreams to new lands? Yet somehow, the light always found a way to shine through the darkness.
"Go with love," she whispered to the city, to all they were leaving behind. Each little group that followed did the same at that spot. They turned, said their prayers, and shed tears. Then turned and continued south, toward Egypt, toward whatever future the way would reveal.
The rhythm of footsteps, quiet prayers, and the endless wind that swept across the Judean wilderness marked the journey south. Their numbers grew as they traveled --- other refugees found them, drawn by some invisible thread of destiny, or perhaps by the quiet strength that emanated from Mari and her core group of followers.
One evening, as they made camp in a sheltered valley, a women even older than Mari, who had joined them that morning, approached her. A lifetime of accumulated wisdom shone in her bright eyes; deep lines etched her face.
"I was there," she said without preamble, "the day they crucified him. I saw you at the foot of the cross."
Mari's hands stilled in their work of grinding wild-picked herbs for the evening meal. The scent of wild thyme rose between them as they looked silently into one-another's soul; sharing a memory of that terrible day, passed like a shadow across both their faces.
"And yet here you are," the old woman continued, "carrying his light forward. Just as he said you would."
Mari smiled gently. "We all carry it," she said, "each in our own way. Some plant seeds, some tend them, some harvest. theWAY flows through all of these."
The old lady smiled, a sly, mischievous smile, as she whispered to Mari, "Guess what I am carrying, all my bags, have a guess."
Mari looked over at her heavy bags in the tall grass, "Your memories?"
The old lady enjoyed that. No, she said, "only frankincense, gold, and myrrh. We can trade it." She smiled from ear to ear.
Mari smiled too. She saw in the elder a spirit who is most-ready for the adventure, a survivor, a leader, someone whom the group can depend on in times to come. "Walk close to me when you can," she said, "I must teach you the higher skills, and help carry a bag sometimes. Everything you have is heavy ... and no food."
"My name is Dianna," she said, reaching out and resting her hand on Mari's arm, "like the goddess."
That night, as the others slept under the vast desert sky, Mari sat awake, watching Sirius rise, listening to Dianna's gentle snoring. The star's pure light seemed to pulse with meaning, and she felt Iesous' presence more strongly than she had in many days.
"You knew, Lord, didn't you?" she whispered to the night air. "You knew Jerusalem would fall, that we would become wanderers. Yet, you also knew that in this scattering, the teaching would spread like wildflower seeds in the wind."
"Why didn't he send me to India, why Thomas instead?" Mari wondered again, for the umpteenth time. "He cant even eat hot peppers".
A soft breeze stirred her hair, carrying the faint scent of distant rain. Tomorrow they would reach the borders of Aqaba, then on to Egypt, where the Sisters of Isis wait to offer sanctuary. But Mari could sense that, for some of them, including herself, Egypt would be just another step on a longer journey.
Ruth materialized beside her, wrapped in a borrowed cloak. "I couldn't sleep," she said softly. "I keep thinking about what you told us --- about the Lord's promise to return. How will we know, Mother? How will we recognize the signs?"
Mari reached out and took the younger woman's hand. "He said it will be withing this generation, and it is now time. The Jews and their Christians think he will come as a military conqueror, that's why there's so much trouble. They make the trouble and say it is a divine sign. But the Lord, my dear, I cannot tell you how he labored under the weight of the visions of what will happen in Jerusalem. He so wished he could help them to stop the soul-people trouble. He saw the destruction that is about to come. And I think that is the first sign, Jerusalem will fall and the temple of that god and his people too. Would that ending be a sign of good new beginnings?"
Ruth sighed. "It is hard mother. To love the people as neighbors, but accept also they have deep racism and disregard, hatred even, for us, the goyim. For them, we are nothing more than objects to use for their benefit. But to us, they are our neighbors and we care for them. Its hard, mother, to be a person of theWAY."
Mari whispered, "It's much harder, the karma, of the soul-person. Lifetimes to come. That saddens me to think how the universe will make the nation confront those debts."
Then she continued, "The signs are already among us, beloved. They're in every act of compassion, every moment of awakening, every heart that opens to universal loving-kindness. The Second Coming isn't just a single moment --- it's happening now, through all of us who carry theWAY forward. Its like the onset of a season, it flows gently in, until the sun bakes hard one day and you say, wow, summer is truly here."
Above them, countless stars wheeled in their eternal dance, while below, those who could sleep, dreamed of both what they'd left behind and about starting over. Mari felt the weight of their trust, their hope, but also the certainty that they were all part of something far greater than themselves --- a river of light flowing through time, touching and transforming everything in its path.
Chapter 17
## The Dead Sea Route
Mari watched the sun's first rays paint the mountains gold as her small group picked their way down the rocky hillside. The rich dawn light caught Dianna's silver hair as the older woman navigated the path with surprising grace, occasionally glancing back to ensure the others followed. Behind them, Jerusalem was long lost to view, though its shadow still weighed heavy on their hearts.
"Like ants leaving a troubled nest," Dianna mused, pausing to help a young mother negotiate a difficult stretch. "Each carrying what we can, moving in lines that seem random but follow ancient wisdom."
Mari smiled at the metaphor. In the week since leaving Jerusalem, their caravan of refugees had indeed come to resemble a colony of ants --- breaking into smaller groups when danger threatened, reuniting at predetermined points, sharing resources, each contributing to the whole. The organization had been essential to their survival.
"We are not the first to walk this path," Mari said softly, her eyes scanning the horizon. "These ancient trade routes have carried countless others fleeing troubles, seeking new beginnings." She thought of young Iesous and his parents making their own exodus to Egypt, so many years ago, guided by the wisdom of the so-called "Three Wise Men" from the East, who were in fact a king Gondophares and two senior clergy from Daoism and Zoroastrianism.
The morning air still held its coolness as they made their way south. Mari had divided their hundred-or-so travelers into groups of no more than ten --- small enough to avoid notice, large enough for mutual support. Young men moved between the groups as scouts and messengers, while the women focused on caring for the children and elderly. They traveled mainly at dawn and dusk, resting during the heat of the day in whatever shade they could find.
"Mother," Ruth appeared at her side, moving with the quiet grace that made her such an effective organizer. Her merchant father's training showed in how she managed their supplies and people, always thinking three steps ahead. Voice low with concern, she reported, "The Romans have increased patrols on the main road. We should keep to the older paths." Even now, she carried her scroll case slung across her back --- the young woman never went anywhere without her notes of Mari's teachings, adding her own insights in that precise Greek handwriting.
Mari nodded. "Tell the others --- we'll follow the shepherds' trails. They're harder going, but safer." She turned to assist an elderly man struggling with his pack, her own joints protesting the effort. At nearly seventy, the journey taxed her body severely, though her spirit remained strong.
Ruth immediately stepped in to help, showing the gentle efficiency that had made her indispensable to their community. The other refugees had taken to calling her "Little Mari" --- not just for how she shadowed her teacher, but for how she too seemed to know exactly who needed help before they asked.
That evening, as their group rested in the shelter of a small wadi, Mari gathered them for the nightly teaching. She watched with quiet pride as Ruth moved among the group, settling the children, helping the elderly find comfortable spots, ensuring everyone could hear.
The girl had an instinct for creating order from chaos, a gift that had proved invaluable during their hasty exodus from Jerusalem. The desert air had cooled, and a profound silence settled over the landscape, broken only by the soft whisper of wind through scrub brush and the occasional call of a night bird.
"Can't stop teaching. Any day now could be my last, and then\...I must know that they can continue\...carry the teaching," was that recurring, nagging thought in the back of her mind all the time. She caught Ruth's eye, seeing in the young woman's attentive gaze the future of their tradition.
"See how the stars emerge?" she said, pointing to the first evening lights appearing above. "Each one revealing itself in its own time, yet all part of the same vast pattern. So it is with truth --- it shows itself gradually, each revelation building on the last, until the full picture becomes clear."
"Did you know that each star is a world on its own? Each has worlds with other beings living in it. And all living beings are like us here on Earth, different bodies and forms, different species, but all have souls. When you look up, wave to your neighbors in the expanse of theWAY. We all breathe the same soul energies."
A young woman, heavy with child, shifted uncomfortably in her stone seat. "But Mother Mari, what truth can there be in all this suffering? In being driven from our homes?"
Mari's eyes softened with compassion. "Ah, little sister. Remember how the Lord taught us --- through every trial comes opportunity for growth. What seems like ending becomes beginning. Look at us here --- Jews, Greeks, Syrians, people of many faith and culture backgrounds, all traveling together, sharing what we have, helping one another survive. Is this not itself a teaching, and a new beginning?"
Dianna added her voice, strong despite her years: "And we carry something precious --- not gold or jewels, but wisdom. theWAY cannot be stolen or destroyed. Wherever we go, it goes with us."
As darkness deepened, Mari led them in the evening chant, their voices rising soft but clear in the desert night:
"To You oh Lord, Resplendent Light who abide in true reality, Father in Heaven, Lord of theWAY --- We make supplication\..."
The familiar words brought comfort, a reminder that while they might be wanderers, they were not lost. Mari's thoughts turned to their destination --- the Island of Philae, where the Sisters of Isis had offered sanctuary. But first they must reach Aqaba, still many days' journey ahead.
The next morning broke humid and unseasonably warm. As they resumed their journey, Mari found herself walking beside a merchant who had joined their group two days earlier. He had been traveling north when news of Jerusalem's increasing turmoil reached him, and he had turned back rather than risk the chaos.
"The Romans aren't the real problem," he said quietly, adjusting the pack on his mule. "It's the zealots, stirring up trouble, convinced their god will intervene if they just create enough chaos. They don't see they're bringing destruction on their own heads."
Mari nodded. "The Lord foresaw this. He wept for Jerusalem, knowing what was to come. Not because of any divine punishment, but because of the natural consequences of hatred and fear."
The merchant glanced at her sharply. "You speak of him as if you knew him personally."
"I did," Mari said simply. "I walked with him, learned from him, saw him die, and saw him rise." She paused, letting the weight of memory settle. "He taught us that true power lies not in weapons or wealth or the ability to control others, but in lovingkindness, in wisdom, in the capacity to see the divine in all beings."
The merchant fell silent, digesting this. After a while, he said, "I have heard stories\... in the ports, in the caravanserais. They say he appeared in India, that he taught there before coming west."
"Yes," Mari smiled. "theWAY knows no boundaries. The Lord found me there when I was a child. I'm Indian. I walked with him, and now I am here. Even now, our brother Thomas from Galilee has joined others in Kashmir, preparing a sanctuary for westerners who seek refuge." Her heart warmed at the thought of Thomas, wondering how he fared in that distant land, with its hot peppers.
Days blended into one another as they made their way south. The landscape grew increasingly arid, the hills more stark. Water became precious, each spring and well marked carefully in Mari's memory. She taught the travelers to recognize signs of hidden water --- certain plants, the flight patterns of birds, the lay of the land.
One afternoon, as they rested in the shade of an overhanging cliff, a commotion arose from the rear of their group. A young scout came running, his face tight with worry.
"Soldiers," he gasped. "Coming up the valley."
Mari rose quickly, her old joints protesting. "How many? How far?"
"A small patrol, perhaps eight men. Less than an hour behind us."
Mari surveyed their group --- women, children, elderly. They could not outrun mounted soldiers, and hiding so many people would be difficult. But then she smiled, remembering an old lesson.
"Sometimes," she said, "the best hiding place is in plain sight." She turned to Dianna. "Bring out your incense. Today we become a pilgrim caravan."
Understanding dawned in the older woman's eyes. Quickly, they rearranged their groups. The trade goods --- Dianna's incense and spices, the merchants' wares --- were prominently displayed. Women adjusted their clothes to look more like religious pilgrims than refugees. Mari taught them a simple chant, one that blended elements of several faiths.
When the patrol found them, they discovered what appeared to be a group of peaceful pilgrims resting during the heat of the day, sharing food and water, singing devotional songs. The commander, dusty and tired himself, accepted their offer of cool water.
"Where are you bound?" he asked Mari, who sat calmly grinding herbs.
"To the great temple at Philae," she replied truthfully. "We go to honor the Divine Mother." She held his gaze steadily, letting him see only an elderly holy woman leading her flock. The commander nodded, whether convinced or simply uninterested in causing trouble with pilgrims, obviously not Jewish. They rode on, leaving the group unharmed.
That evening, as they made camp, Ruth asked Mari, "Was it right to deceive them?"
"We spoke truth," Mari replied. "We are pilgrims, seeking sanctuary with the Divine Mother. That we also flee persecution does not make our spiritual journey less real." She began preparing the evening meal, watching Ruth's precise movements as they showed the younger women how to make trail bread. The girl had her father's methodical nature, measuring ingredients with merchant's accuracy.
Later, she called Ruth over for another talk, noting how the young woman approached serious discussions with that characteristic tilt of her head, ready to analyze every word. "You ask if it was right to deceive him? I know you mean it not in the moral way, but theologically. Let me put it this way. If we were pressured and it would save the lives of the group, we would seduce them, and if that was not sufficient, to poison them. If a predatorial animal attacks the group, we will fight to the death for survival. If a predatorial religious group attack and threaten our livelihood and existence, we would do the same, there is no difference. Ethics, my dear, ethics is the hardest part of philosophy and we may never stop searching wisdom from it, and that is what you are doing. I am proud of you."
Ruth smiled, her scholarly demeanor briefly giving way to youthful mischief, "You would seduce him?" Mari smiled back, noting how her student's eyes sparkled when she allowed herself these moments of lightness. "No my dear, I would call you to do that, you have the superior skill and tools for that craft."
The joke landed differently than intended. A shadow crossed Ruth's face, and she whispered, "Mother. I have never been with a man." Her fingers nervously traced the edge of her scroll case --- a gesture Mari had come to recognize as a sign of her deeper uncertainties.
Mari watched her for a while, seeing not just the serious young teacher, but the woman on the cusp of discovering herself. She quickly worked through her own issues, and took the position of a normal-thinking young Wayist in that culture --- she assessed that Ruth was definitely not averse to the idea, just uncertain. As always, the girl approached the unknown with careful thought rather than fear.
"I believe that will change now that we are more free from the strange morals and sanctimonious judgements of the people we left behind. You will find sensuousness and discover new parts of your soul, without guilt or shame, and approach it with the awe and beauty that it brings. It will happen, Ruth. It will take you by storm, cloud your brain, make you stupid, demand all the breath you have, and it will rejuvenate you, take you to heights you cannot now know of, and perhaps also break your heart --- the most immense pain a human can endure. Then, you heal, and do it again. That is life. It cannot be otherwise and when it is, usually it is because something went wrong and robbed you of it. Don't let anything rob you of it. It is most precious."
Mari watched her student absorb these words with characteristic thoroughness, already organizing them into the careful structure of her mind. But there was something else there too --- a glimmer of anticipation, of readiness for this new chapter of learning. The teacher in Mari recognized that some lessons couldn't be taught, only lived.
As the first stars appeared, Mari let Ruth lead the group in meditation, teaching them to find strength in stillness. Ruth did well. "Even in movement, we can be centered," she explained. "Even in uncertainty, we can be sure of theWAY." Over the days that came, Ruth also taught them about the deeper meanings and utilities of the Dayspring ritual. How That one ritual, all People of theWAY across the world share in common.
The days that followed brought their own challenges --- scorching heat, dwindling supplies, the constant fear of discovery, potential robbers as well.
Yet, Mari observed how adversity shaped them, burning away nonessentials like a refiner's fire. Those who had been strangers became family. Those who had been wealthy learned humility. Those who had been humble discovered their inner strength.
Chapter 18
## Aqaba
Finally, after two grueling weeks, they caught sight of Aqaba. The port city sprawled along the coast of the Red Sea, its harbor crowded with ships from across the known world. The sight of water --- so much water --- after their desert crossing brought tears to many eyes.
But Mari cautioned them to remain careful. "We enter a different world now," she said. "Aqaba lives by trade --- in goods, in information, in loyalties. We must be wise as serpents, gentle as doves." She smiled, remembering how often Iesous had used that phrase.
Their contact in the city was Abd al-Yesu, a wealthy merchant and teacher of theWAY. Mari had never met him, but she knew his reputation --- he had studied under Iesous in Takshashila, when he was still a teenager. His devotion had led him to change his name to "Servant of Yesu."
His home overlooked the harbor, and the sweet scent of incense drifted down to greet her as she approached. She told his servant who she was and that she has a group of people seeking to buy transport to Egypt.
As they entered Aqaba, Abd al-Yesu himself came out to meet them --- a tall man in his 60s with keen eyes and a gentle manner. He greeted Mari with profound respect, touching his forehead to her hands. "Welcome, blessed one," he said in Greek, then switched to her native Sanskrit, surprising her. "We have awaited your coming."
Mari felt tears spring to her eyes at hearing her mother's instruction language after so long. "You speak the language my mother schooled me in?"
He smiled. "I learned it in Takshashila, where our Lord taught. Come --- all is prepared."
The merchant's compound proved large enough to house all their refugees. Women appeared with water for washing, fresh clothes, food. Mari watched as her weary travelers were cared for, seeing in this hospitality the truth of theWAY manifested.
That evening, after others had been settled, Abd al-Yesu invited Mari to join him in his private courtyard. A fountain played softly in the center, its music soothing to ears long filled with desert silence. The air was heavy with the sweet fragrance of night-blooming jasmine.
Mari sat and watched the beautifully decorated courtyard with its mosaic tileworks, garden, and exotic old wood furniture. "So luxurious," she thought, "yet understated, authentic."
Abd al-Yesu said, "The Yasmin fragrance. I always come here to be at one with our Mother in Heaven."
Mari and Abd al-Yesu looked at one another and a deep connection formed, they were at the same level of understanding and appreciating the true nature of divinity. She knew then, he also knew the meaning of the divine mother's Sanskrit title, Pandarajanana, 'God Yasmin Light Mother of Heaven'.
After a while of mutual silence and drinking in the energies of the space, Abd al-Yesu asked, "Tell me of our Lord," he said simply. "Tell me of his last days."
And so, Mari spoke, under the stars, of all that had happened in Jerusalem. She told of the crucifixion, of the resurrection, of the Lord's final teachings. Abd al-Yesu listened intently, occasionally asking questions, his eyes bright with unshed tears. He could not get enough, his soul yearned for more, and for understanding the Why? of it all.
He saw that Mari was fatigued from reliving the memories, and changed the subject.
"We have built a place of gathering," he said when she had finished. "Around an ancient tree --- the Lord would have liked that. Will you teach there, while you are with us?"
"How did you know I would come?" Mari asked.
"The Lord told me, years ago in Takshashila, I was still like 13 years old, working with my father. You were there, teaching children at the stream. I was so in love with you, I became lovesick.
My Father said, 'No boy, she's way out of your league, ten years older, get over it.' Well, I could not bear not seeing you again, my heart broke. But, some days later, the Lord pulled me aside and he said, 'When Jerusalem falls, look for the lotus flower. She will bring light from the darkness.' Yes, that is how it happened\....
Then, we heard about you in Jerusalem. But I cannot go up there, some troubles with the king and my family. So, my father and I, and our community of people of theWAY, we've been preparing ever since."
Mari was without words. She tried to, but no words seemed right. All she could do that felt right, was to go over to Abd al-Yesu and give him a deep hug, and kiss him on the forehead. Both had unshed tears in their eyes. Not so much for themselves but the weight of a shared history with the Lord at its center.
Over the following weeks, Mari learned more about the vibrant community of Wayists that had grown up in Aqaba. Here, far from Jerusalem's troubled politics, theWAY had taken root and flourished among the traders and seafarers. They had built a beautiful meeting place around an ancient tree, its branches providing shade for gatherings, its roots symbolizing the deep anchoring of wisdom.
Many of Mari's group found employment in the city --- some with the merchant houses, others in the busy shipyards. Aqaba's trade required much documentation, so those with skills as scribes were especially welcome.
The Arabs' hunger for learning touched Mari deeply. They begged her to share every detail of her time with Iesous, recording her words carefully in their own scripts and languages. They compiled and translated a core teaching known as Primary Teaching of the Way.
Mari spent many hours in the teaching space beneath the ancient tree, sharing not only memories but the deeper wisdom of theWAY. The traders who gathered there brought questions from their travels across the known world, creating a rich dialogue that reminded Mari of the discussions in Kashmir.
The Arab traders brought delicacies from their travels --- honeyed dates stuffed with pistachios and wrapped in paper-thin pastry, their sweetness perfectly balanced by cardamom and a hint of sea salt.
Mari watched as her companions discovered the joy of dipping fresh flatbread into bowls of hummus drizzled with olive oil, so fresh it carried the essence of sun-ripened olives. The traders laughed at their delight, explaining how each region had its own way of preparing the dish --- some adding pine nuts, others paprika, each claiming theirs was the authentic recipe.
"Taste this," Abd al-Yesu said one evening, offering Mari a small cup of what looked like liquid gold. "It's called *qahwa* --- coffee. The Ethiopian traders bring the beans, but we've learned to roast them just so, adding cardamom and saffron." The rich aroma filled her senses, somehow both earthy and ethereal. "They say shepherds who noticed their goats becoming energetic after eating certain berries discovered it."
In the marketplace, Ruth was drawn to a merchant's stall where silks from China lay alongside wool so finely woven it could pass through a ring. She ran her fingers over textiles dyed in colors she had never seen --- deep purples extracted from sea snails, blues from indigo plants, and a red so vibrant it seemed to pulse with its own life.
"This," the merchant said, holding up a length of fabric that seemed to change color as it moved, "comes from the islands beyond India. They say giant spiders that live in the jungle spun the threads." He demonstrated how the cloth could be crushed into a ball yet emerge without a wrinkle. "The secret of its making is known only to the women of one tribe."
The port itself was a feast for the senses. Spice merchants' stalls sent clouds of fragrant dust into the air --- cinnamon, pepper, cardamom, and mysterious blends from distant lands. Mari learned that some of these spices were worth more than their weight in gold, traveling thousands of miles by camel and ship to reach Aqaba's busy harbor.
One afternoon, a Persian merchant brought out his most precious wares --- carpets woven with such skill that each told a story. "Look here," he said, pointing to one particularly intricate design. "This pattern tells the story of a king who sought wisdom rather than power. See how the colors change depending on which way you view it? Just as truth changes depending on how you look at it." The wool felt alive under Mari's fingers, dyed with natural pigments and woven with knots so tiny she could barely see them.
Some evenings, the elders would gather in Abd al-Yesu's courtyard, where servants brought trays of tiny cups filled with sweet mint tea. The ritual of pouring became a meditation in itself --- the tea poured from height to create a foam crown, the process repeated three times. "The first cup is gentle like life," their host explained, "the second strong like love, the third bitter like death. Just as theWAY teaches us to embrace all aspects of existence."
The local dress particularly fascinated the women in Mari's group --- loose, flowing garments in natural fibers that seemed to catch every breeze, making the desert heat bearable. Local women taught them to wrap their head coverings in ways that protected from both sun and sand, using fabrics so light they seemed to float on air yet so strong they lasted for years.
Mari thought to herself how she had been teaching udbhu-kanti for years and years but never thought she would see how it is lived so deeply, by wealthy people, at that. People of theWAY really appreciate life and the energies of the universe present in all things. She was deep in thought and appreciation of the teaching when someone interrupted her.
"Here, sister, please accept this," an elderly weaver said, presenting Mari with a shawl of the finest wool, dyed the deep blue of twilight. "This color comes from a hundred indigo dips, each one making it darker, richer. Like wisdom --- it deepens with each immersion." The fabric was so soft it felt like wearing a cloud, yet it provided warmth in the cool desert nights.
Even the simplest meals became occasions for learning and sharing. The local bread, baked in clay ovens with a sprinkle of sesame seeds, served as both food and metaphor. "See how it puffs up with air pockets?" Abd al-Yesu pointed out. "Our master bakers say this is like the soul --- it needs both substance and space to be complete."
Mari spent many hours in the teaching space beneath the ancient tree, sharing not only memories but the deeper wisdom of theWAY. The traders who gathered there brought questions from their travels across the known world, creating a rich dialogue that reminded Mari of the discussions in Kashmir.
"What fascinates me," said a merchant who traded along the southern routes, "is how the teaching adapts to each place, each people, yet remains essentially the same."
"Like water," Mari replied, smiling at the aptness of the image with the sea breeze cooling their faces. "It takes the shape of any vessel, yet its nature doesn't change."
The Arabic translations of Mari's teachings, from the Lord, spread rapidly along the trade routes, carried by merchants who valued wisdom as much as material goods. Books she wrote in Jerusalem, which had found their way here. She was particularly moved when she learned they were constructing a temple --- tariq alsama, they would call it --- in Mina Rashid on the eastern coast of Arabia, where traders exchanged her teachings for pearls.
When Abd al-Yesu asked her to leave copies of her books with them, Mari agreed readily. The manuscripts had become a burden to transport, and she trusted these careful record-keepers to preserve and share the wisdom they contained. They were particularly interested in her translations of the ancient Sumerian writings about Wayist cosmology, and her precious copy of The Authentia.
Mari also handed over her finished manuscript of her book, "Good News of The Way" to Abd al-Yesu, and explained it was aimed at People of theWAY in Galilee and the surrounding areas, because it explains some of the work and travels they did there.
"Your words will continue to teach long after we are gone," Abd al-Yesu said as he carefully stored the manuscripts. "They will reach places we cannot imagine, so many people want it."
Surprised, Mari asked, "It sounds as if everyone in your country is a person of theWAY?"
Abd al-Yesu smiled. He knew what she was getting at, "Of course not, mother. You know. Juniors need the rules and laws, and the fear of the religions. It helps them, because they don't have their own dharma well developed. True, we have people all over Africa and the gulf and Arabia, but of course not everyone."
As peaceful and comfortable as their time in Aqaba was, Mari felt the pull to continue their journey. The Lord's instructions had been clear --- she was to go to Philae, and from there to Aksum. One morning, as she watched the sun rise over the Red Sea, she knew it was time to move on.
Most of her original group had chosen to remain in Aqaba, finding new lives in this tolerant city. But a small core --- including Ruth, Dianna, and several others who had grown closer to Mari during their journey --- would continue with her.
Abd al-Yesu arranged passage for them on a trading vessel bound for the Egyptian coast near Aswan. "The Sisters of Isis will meet you there," he assured Mari. "All has been arranged."
Abd al-Yesu's face darkened with a shadow Mari had come to recognize --- the look of one carrying bitter news too long held silent. "There are stories from Jerusalem," he said quietly, his merchant's hands fidgeting with his cup. "While our people died in the streets, King Agrippa, and his sister Berenice hosted lavish feasts in their palace overlooking the city. They say Berenice would stand at her window with her new lover, the Roman general Titus, watching Jerusalem burn like some grand spectacle for their entertainment."
He paused, the lamplight catching the grief in his eyes. "When the flames threatened their quarter, Titus moved them to safety, of course. They drank wine and played politics while the Temple fell." His voice carried that particular weariness Mari had heard too often --- the exhaustion of seeing how those who styled themselves elite, so often proved to be the poorest specimens of humanity. "The Lord always said we would know them by their fruits," he added softly. "While common people died protecting their neighbors, the so-called nobility protected only their own interests."
Mari nodded, remembering how Iesous had foreseen not just the destruction, but the betrayals that would accompany it. How often had she seen this pattern --- those who claimed the highest birth showing the lowest character, while simple souls revealed true nobility in times of crisis.
"Reminds one of the story of Nero, playing his fiddle while Rome burnt, a few years ago," whispered Mari. She stood, struck, and had to work through that, letting the wisdom of the depths of human depravity potential, sink in. "Some people's gods are cold like that," she thought to herself.
Abd al-Yesu touched Mari's shoulder in support. Saying, "Sorry, sister. I will be back later," as he turned and walked away with his own struggle on the matter.
Mari and Dianna spent time with Abd al-Yesu's two wives and taught them energy healing, and how to sense the minds of the soul and the spirit to diagnose. She made sketches, diagrams, and labelled everything she taught.
"We use the word pneumatherapy to explain what we do. So, now you also know how to do it. Please teach it, it is a holy art," Mari pleaded with them over their tea and a stuffed date snack. Her new friends were in awe and ecstatic to write it all up and create training manuals.
The morning of their departure dawned clear and bright. The harbor was alive with activity --- ships loading and unloading, sailors calling to each other in dozens of languages, some of which Mari recognized and quickly decided she doesn't want to hear more of what the men call one another. The cry of seabirds wheeling overhead. Mari stood at the rail of their ship, watching as Aqaba receded behind them.
"You're quiet," Ruth observed, coming to stand beside her.
"I'm remembering another journey over water," Mari said softly. "Long ago, from India to Basra with the Lord. How young I was then, how little I understood about where the path would lead."
As their ship caught the wind and moved out into the Red Sea, Mari felt a familiar presence --- that sense of the Lord's spirit that had never truly left her. The salty breeze carried the scent of adventure, of new beginnings. Ahead lay Philae, the Isle of the Divine Mother, where the Sisters of Isis waited to welcome them.
"Every ending is a beginning," she murmured, words the Lord had so often spoken. She turned to Ruth with a smile. "Come --- let's gather the others. Even on a ship, there are lessons to be shared, wisdom to be gained."
And so, they sailed on, toward Philae, while behind them in Aqaba, the ancient tree continued to shelter seekers of wisdom, and Mari's words spread out along the trade routes like ripples on water, touching lives she would never know, carrying theWAY forward into an unknowable future.
The journey to Philae would take several weeks, but Mari felt no impatience. Each day brought its own teachings, its own opportunities for growth. She knew that when they finally reached the sacred island, it would be exactly the right time --- just as all things in theWAY happened in their proper season.
Chapter 19
## Philae
As they ascended the Nile River in their small boat from Ashwan, the air grew heavy with moisture and the scent of growing things. It's different, life around fresh water. Miles and miles of fresh, life-giving water.
Water birds rose in graceful arcs against the morning sky, their calls a welcome change from the endless whisper of wind through dunes.
Mari felt memories stirring --- as if she had been here in a previous life. Something familiar about most things. that seemed to come from the land itself. This was where Iesous had spent his early years, learning from the Sisters of Isis the ancient wisdom that would later blend so seamlessly with what he learned in the East.
The Sisters had prepared well for their arrival. As the group approached the temple complex on the Island of Philae, small boats were already crossing the sparkling water to meet them.
Mari watched her travel-weary companions' faces brighten at the sight of the magnificent temple rising from the river like a dream of stone and color. Her 70 something body, also celebrated.
"It's so beautiful," breathed Ruth, her scholar's mind already analyzing the architecture, noting details in that methodical way she had. Though she'd never seen anything grander than the bland religious schools of Judea and the rather stark temple in Jerusalem, she was doing more than just admiring --- she was studying, learning, as she always did. Mari noticed how the young woman's fingers twitched toward her scroll case, eager to record her observations. Even after months of hard travel, Ruth's thirst for knowledge remained unquenched.
"Yes," said Mari, warmed by her protégé's enthusiasm. She had watched Ruth grow from an eager student to a promising teacher in her own right, combining her father's gift for languages with her own deep spiritual insight. "And it's more than beautiful --- it's a sanctuary of the Divine Feminine, an earthly shrine to God our Mother in Heaven, where wisdom has been preserved through countless generations." She didn't add that it was also one of the few places left where women could serve as priestesses, where their spiritual authority was recognized and honored --- though she saw in Ruth's keen eyes that the young woman had already grasped this significance. Despite her youth, Ruth had an uncanny ability to perceive the deeper meanings behind things, one of the many qualities that had drawn Mari to her as a potential successor.
As they crossed the water, the temple's massive pylons seemed to glow in the late afternoon light. Egyptian Lotus flowers dotted the shallows, their red and blue blossoms nodding in the boat's wake. Mari remembered Iesous teaching about the lotus --- how it grew from the mud of ordinary existence toward enlightenment, just as human souls evolved through many lives toward spiritual perfection.
The High Priestess herself waited on the steps to greet them, her white robes gleaming. She was older than Mari imagined her to be, but her eyes were still keen and bright with intelligence.
"Welcome home, daughter," she said, embracing Mari. Then, looking over the group of refugees, she added more softly, "We have been expecting you. The Lord appeared to us in vision, preparing us for your arrival."
Mari felt tears spring to her eyes at this confirmation of Iesous' continuing presence and care. "Thank you, Mother. These are all his children, seeking sanctuary and a place to preserve his teaching."
"And they shall have it," the priestess assured her. "We have much to learn from each other, I think. The Lord's way of bringing teachings together, of finding the common thread of truth in all traditions --- this is wisdom we badly need in these troubled times."
As the group was led into the accommodation side of the temple complex, Mari paused for a moment, looking back across the water. The setting sun had turned the river to molten gold, while in the deepening eastern sky, the first stars were beginning to appear. Somewhere out there, she knew, Iesous was preparing for his next appearance, his return in glory. But for now, there was work to be done --- teaching to preserve, souls to nurture, wisdom to pass on.
"One day at a time," she whispered to herself, a smile touching her lips as she remembered him saying those very words, "theWAY flows like this river --- we need only stay in its current."
With that thought warming her heart, she turned and followed her companions into the temple, ready to begin the next phase of their journey together.
Life settled into a rhythm at Philae, though nothing like the rigid patterns Mari had known in Jerusalem's religious circles.
Nothing felt forced, watched over by hovering critics, opinions on one's piety, and orthodoxy of the meaning of words that pertain not to spirituality but silly things like wearing linen and regulations about menstruation and rites of cleanliness.
Here, devotion flowed as naturally as the river, expressed in song and movement, in the daily tending of gardens, in the gathering of herbs and the preparation of medicines, in teaching and in quiet contemplation.
The Sisters welcomed Mari's group with grace, finding ways to integrate each person's skills and talents into the temple's life. Some helped in the healing rooms, others in the kitchens or gardens. Those with a gift for languages worked in the library, helping to preserve and copy sacred texts. Even the children found their place, their laughter echoing through the columned halls like music.
Mari spent much of her time teaching, sharing what she had learned from Iesous both in the East and during their travels together. The Sisters were particularly interested in his teachings about the Divine Mother and the equality of all souls before heaven, and the yang and yin energies in all of creation. These weren't new concepts to them --- the cult of Isis had always honored the feminine principle --- but Iesous had woven these truths into a universal teaching that transcended any single tradition.
One evening, as she sat in the temple garden watching the sun set over the Nile, the High Priestess joined her. The air was sweet with Wisteria night-blooms from the immaculate hedges, and somewhere in the gathering darkness, a sistrum chimed softly.
"You're preparing to leave us again, aren't you?" the older woman asked without preamble.
Mari nodded, unsurprised by her perception. "Not yet, but soon. There are others who need to hear the teaching, especially now as darkness spreads across Judea, and Rome will follow through with more. Many of Jewish heritage want a way out of that god's mindset and the Christians don't offer that. They are dispersed all over, many are settling in the mountains of India. But, the Lord showed me a path leading south, into Ethiopia and beyond."
"Ah yes, the kingdom of Aksum," the priestess nodded. "They too preserve ancient wisdom there. And after that?"
"East again, eventually. To Kashmir, where it all began\... and where it will begin again." Mari's voice grew distant, seeing beyond the present moment. "He's preparing something there, something magnificent. A gateway, opening between worlds\..."
The priestess laid a gentle hand on Mari's arm. "Then we must prepare as well. I'll assign some of our younger sisters to travel with you --- ones who are strong in both body and spirit. And we'll copy your teachings, preserve them here while you carry them abroad."
"Thank you, Mother. But\..." Mari hesitated. "Some of our refugees may wish to stay in Egypt permanently. They've lost so much already\..."
"Of course they may stay! The onshore communities are welcoming. This can be their sanctuary for all who seek wisdom. Besides," she added with a smile, "they've brought new life to these old stones. Listen!"
From somewhere in the temple complex came the sound of children singing --- a Hebrew-Aramaic melody carrying words about theWAY. The ancient columns seemed to soften in the fading light, embracing the new song as they had embraced so many others through the centuries.
Mari smiled. "For most, that is all they have now. And it carries them. They have lost loved ones, farms, businesses, homes, and their culture. But, in their worldview and philosophy, they look inside and find hope, courage, and joy. I am so happy they have this, this, incredible inner strength that we who grew old with it sometimes take for granted."
Later that night, Mari walked along the river's edge, watching the stars emerge one by one. The water moved past in eternal flow, dark and mysterious, carrying the reflection of the heavens on its surface. "Like the river," she thought, "theWAY flows ever onward, reflecting divine light, bringing life wherever it touches. The river, like life, flows onward without seeking permission; on the surface calm, in the undercurrents tumultuous and dark, a place of competition and survival seeking. Yet, the river flows, and the best place to be is to flow along with it, not get stuck in the side streams, currents, and eddies. Seek the flow, and let go. Ooh, I should write that down, this old brain forgets. Seek the flow, and let go."
Mari lost herself in the sound of the water flow, the night, the senses of the breeze and crickets, wisteria --- life itself.
"I understand better now, my Lord," she whispered to the evening star. "Why you went first to the East, then brought us back to plant seeds in the West. And now South, and East again\... weaving a web of light around the world."
"I remember, Lord. Once you said there are lands unknown to us, and you work there. What lands Lord? What are they like, those people? I remember asking if they were like Jerusalem, or like the Romans. You said, there are no lands with spiritual deserts as vast and deep as that. You said they are spiritually awakened more than all of the lands we visited; they live harmoniously with nature, they don't fear death, they heal and consult the animals and plants, their hearts are warm and hold families close. You said it was warm, jungles, and the people have tremendous joy. I am tired and my body old, Lord. Those lands, those people, I do hope Lord my next life will be there."
The star seemed to pulse brighter for a moment, and Mari felt that familiar warmth in her heart that told her he was near, listening, loving, guiding always. The night air stirred with promise, carrying the most delicate scent of lotus flowers, and possibilities yet to bloom.
Each night, Mari would offer her heart's whispers to heaven: "I miss you, my Lord, though you are never far. My hands remember the texture of your robe, though now I touch only the wind. My ears strain for your laughter, though you speak to my heart each day. You taught me to love with all my soul, all my heart, and all my minds, and now I see traces of you in every living being. Each face I meet reflects something of your light."
"'theWAY of love can break your heart,'" she remembered him saying. She had watched his heart break countless times for humanity's suffering, had seen that final shattering on the cross. Her own heart's smaller sorrows seemed easier to bear when she remembered how his great heart held the pain of all that soul-people do to creatures. Yet even in that pain, he had shown her how love transforms everything it touches.
Chapter 20
## To cut the bonds and feel nothing
In the months that followed, Mari divided her time between teaching and preparing for the journey ahead. The library at Philae had become her sanctuary, where she worked to record everything she remembered of Iesous' teachings, both from their time in the East and their travels through Judea. The Sisters provided sheets of the finest papyrus, and skilled scribes helped to translate her words into multiple languages.
"Every detail matters," she would tell them, "even the smallest ones. The way he would stop to notice a bird building its nest, or how he spoke to children as equals, or the poems he would compose in Sanskrit while walking the dusty roads. These things show theWAY as clearly as his greater teachings. In time to come, soul-people will destroy our books, like before, so we must have them everywhere, and in our hearts. The truth will always survive."
The work often brought memories flooding back with such intensity that she would have to pause, overwhelmed. One afternoon, as she described his teaching about the lotus flower, she found tears falling onto the papyrus.
\
"Shall we stop for today?" asked Sophia, one of the younger scribes.
"No," Mari smiled, wiping her eyes. "These are not tears of sorrow. It's just\... sometimes I feel him so close, as if he's standing right here, watching us preserve his words. And I remember how he said that nothing true is ever lost, that wisdom finds its way through time like water flowing underground, emerging when and where it's needed most."
News continued to reach them from Jerusalem --- none of it good. The violence had spread, touching even the most remote communities. More refugees arrived on the river shores near Philae almost daily, bringing stories of destruction and persecution. Mari and the others welcomed them all, helping them find healing not just for their bodies but for their traumatized souls. The community on the shore made space for them. Farmers employed them, and people offered they could cut building materials on their land.
"How do you bear it, Mother? I can't. I break. The visions that haunt them. Thousands of dead in the streets, mounts of corpses, blood running like a river in the streets. Praising their god as they bleed out and watch their children orphaned." Ruth asked her one evening, after a particularly difficult group had arrived. "Hearing all their stories of suffering, yet staying so peaceful?"
Mari was quiet for a moment, watching the last light fade from the western sky. "Remember, dear. You were there. You heard the good news of the Lord's teaching. You chose. You were at the crossroad --- you chose not Judaism, you chose not the Christian version of Judaism, you chose theWAY. Thousands upon thousands of other faced that same choice. Today, you are here, and they are there. Never forget that," said Mari.
She continued, "But to your question, our hearts break for them. I bear it because he bears it with us. He saw it all long ago, it broke his heart. He tried to change them, he tried to show them another path."
Mari wiped tears from her eyes, and she held Ruth close. "Because I understand now that suffering isn't the end of the story --- it's part of the transformation. Like the lotus growing through dark water toward the light, they too will reflect on it all in Paradise, and many of them will develop the wisdom that soul-minds are prone to those religions, and those sentiments. Then, next time, it will be easier for them to resist."
Ruth was ashen-faced, hard to say words, came\...., "And the people in charge, what about them? How do you not have this pure hatred for them that we taste in our mouths, and cannot get rid of?"
Mari closed her eyes. She knew exactly that hate you can taste, that burning hate that can devour your soul. The Lord was right. Her life experiences make her a good teacher. Still with closed eyes, Mari started, "What I feel for them is nothing. What I feel for them is more extreme than what you feel. You keep an energy connection, a bond, a bond of fear and hatred, so you make them part of your life and that energy runs through your soul-minds, and takes up space where beauty and goodness should be. What I feel, is nothing. My fear for what I feel is that it is a very deep, dark, almost irrecoverable nothingness. In that nothingness, I see the mountains of karma they and all who benefitted from their evil will suffer. I see the slight, the disregard, the discomfort, the fear, the anger, every disempowerment, every shame, pain and heartache, the shattered dreams and shattered trust in humanity, all making up a million pieces of karma that each and every one of them will have to suffer and work through in coming lifetimes. It is like eating a mountain with a spoon and you cannot die, cannot stop, until you are done. Lifetime after lifetime, they will deal with that karma. Their children, wives, grand-children, three to four generations down, the friends, every citizen who rooted for the warmongers and wrongdoers will suffer the karmic consequences of all they benefited from. That is why you witness empires fall --- they keep reincarnating until they have all paid their debts and their empire is humiliated and the new conquerors inflict upon them what they did to others."
"The Lord teaches 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.' The same goes for what evil they did unto the innocent; they do to the Lord. Theirs is now an accursed nation because of their laws and words and deeds. That is why I feel nothing, because no-one can bear to look upon the severe suffering they have created for themselves --- much worse than what they inflicted upon any single person. Theirs, is the karma for the suffering of each and every individual their inactions and actions touched. It is better for me to feel nothing. The alternative is to be a deity and see it all without the ability to feel nothing. That, I cannot do.
Ruth said, "I think, I can also feel nothing, like you Mother. But it sounds..."
Mari interjected with compassion, "It's hard, both ways. Damned if you don't, damned if you do. We feel, we care, and that is why life is hard for us sometimes. But, then. Life is also very joyful and deeply meaningful and beautiful at other times."
As spring moved toward summer, signs began appearing that it was time to move on. Mari noticed them in small ways at first --- a restlessness in her spirit during morning meditation, dreams of mountains and distant shores, a deepening certainty that others were waiting to hear the teaching.
The High Priestess helped her select traveling companions --- three young priestesses in learning, skilled in healing and languages, two scribes to continue recording the teaching, and several of the stronger refugees who felt called to continue the journey. They would follow the Nile south, stopping at temples and communities along the way, gradually making their way toward the kingdom of Aksum.
On their last evening at Philae, the Sisters held a ceremony in the great hall. It was absolutely spectacular. Hundreds of oil lamps cast dancing shadows on the painted walls as voices raised in harmonious chant --- Egyptian priestesses and refugees together, singing of the One Light that shines through all traditions.
Mari stood at the back, watching. The columns soared overhead like ancient trees, their capitals blooming with lotus and papyrus designs. Incense smoke curled in graceful spirals, as if carrying prayers heavenward. In that moment, she saw clearly how each person's path was like one of those curling threads of smoke --- individual yet part of a greater pattern, all rising toward the same divine heaven.
"The gateway opens wider," she whispered, feeling Iesous' presence strong within her heart. "Not just in Kashmir, but everywhere hearts are ready to receive it. I cannot imagine how many thousands of the suffering, some say hundreds of thousands, repentantly called out his name in Jerusalem during the past week," she whispered in her mind.
The chanting swelled, filling the vast space with waves of sound. Tomorrow they would begin their journey south, carrying the teaching to new lands. But tonight was for gathering strength, for remembering they were part of something vast and beautiful and eternal --- a river of light flowing through time, touching and transforming everything in its path.
Chapter 21
## Aksum
The journey south along the Nile was like traveling through time itself. Ancient temples rose from the desert like dreams of stone, while village life along the riverbanks continued much as it had for thousands of years. Their small group moved slowly, stopping wherever people showed interest in the teaching.
They learned from Egyptian temples and teachers along the way.
Mari found that the Egyptians, with their deep understanding of death and rebirth, quickly grasped the essence of Iesous' message about transformation and evolution of the soul.
"Your Osiris dies and is reborn," she would tell them. "Just as our Lord taught, we too are reborn to become spiritual immortals when we graduate from the Butterfly Path."
The scribes recorded everything --- not just the teachings, but the questions people asked, the way different cultures understood and adapted the message. Mari encouraged this diversity of understanding. "theWAY is like the Nile," she would say. "One river, but it waters many different kinds of gardens."
One evening, as they made camp near a grove of date palms, a group of local children gathered to listen to stories. Mari told them about Iesous and the butterfly, how he had used its transformation to teach about the soul's journey.
"Look there," she said, pointing to a chrysalis hanging from a branch. "Inside that small case, something miraculous is happening. The caterpillar is becoming something entirely new. This is what the Lord meant when he spoke of being 'born again' --- being born as a new kind of being, rising higher, becoming more beautiful, more free."
The children's eyes grew wide with wonder, and Mari felt Iesous' presence strongly, remembering how he too had always found his deepest teachings in nature's simple miracles.
As they traveled further south, the air grew moist, the vegetation more lush. They began to hear stories of the kingdom of Aksum, where ancient wisdom was preserved in hidden monasteries. Some said their libraries held scrolls from the time before the great flood, though Mari knew better than to put too much stock in such tales.
What interested her more were the reports of communities already practicing something very like theWAY, though they called it by different names. She hoped it would be remnants of the most ancient teachings of theWAY. "The Lord's work goes before us," she told her companions. "We're not bringing something new, but helping people recognize what they already know in their hearts. Many are old souls and have encountered the teaching before. We remind them."
One night, unable to sleep, Mari walked a little way from their camp to watch the stars. The desert air was cool and sharp with the scent of herbs. Sirius blazed overhead, seeming to pulse with meaning.
"The signs are becoming clearer," she whispered to the presence she always felt near her. "The gateway you spoke of\... it's not just in one place or time, is it? It's opening everywhere, in every heart that's ready."
A warm breeze stirred her hair, carrying the faint scent of lotus flowers, though they were far from any water. She smiled, recognizing His touch in the wind, his message in the fragrance. Yes, the time was approaching --- not just for her journey's end, but for a new beginning that would transform the world.
In the distance, a night bird called, its song pure and piercing in the darkness. Tomorrow they would continue south, following the river's flow toward Aksum. But for now, Mari stood in the starlight, her heart full of gratitude for all that had been and all that was yet to come.
As they came closer to Aksum, the landscape changed dramatically, as if announcing the was ocean ahead. The endless desert gave way to rolling highlands, their slopes green with vegetation Mari had never seen before. The evening air grew cooler, filled with the songs of unfamiliar birds, and in the distance, mountains rose like guardians against the sky.
"Look," said Ruth one morning, pointing ahead to where a rider approached at speed. "They've been watching for us."
Indeed, word of their coming had traveled ahead. The rider was the first of several guides sent to escort them to the capital. Mari noticed how differently people received them here---not as refugees or wandering teachers, but as honored emissaries bringing long-awaited wisdom.
"Your coming was foretold," the lead guide told them as they made their way through fertile valleys. "Our seers spoke of a teaching that would unite the wisdom of East and West, carried by a woman who walks between worlds."
Mari smiled at this, but said nothing. Sailors talk a lot, and books speak volumes more than writers intend. She had learned that such stories often arose around the teaching, like flowers growing naturally where seeds had fallen. What mattered was not the stories themselves, but the truth they pointed toward.
The capital city took her breath away when they first saw it --- not for its size or grandeur, though it had both, but for how it seemed to grow from the landscape itself, its stone buildings rising in harmony with the hills that cradled them. Great stelae, carved with unknown scripts, stood like silent sentinels, and everywhere Mari looked she saw signs of ancient wisdom preserved and honored.
They were taken to a compound attached to one of the main temples, where rooms had been prepared for them. That evening, as Mari sat in the courtyard, watching the sunset paint the stone buildings in shades of gold and rose, she felt a familiar presence beside her.
"The signs are all around us now, aren't they?" said Ruth softly, settling beside her on the stone bench. Over the months of travel, the young woman had become more than just a companion --- she was now Mari's closest confidante, one who often seemed to sense what Mari was thinking before she spoke.
"Yes," Mari answered, watching the evening star appear above the mountains. "Can you feel it? The way the very air seems to vibrate with expectation? He's preparing something extraordinary, not just here, but everywhere. The gateway opens wider each day."
In the following weeks, they established a routine similar to what had worked in Egypt. Mari taught daily, while the scribes recorded everything and translated it into local languages. The people of Aksum were particularly interested in the Lord's teachings about the divine family in heaven, headed by God the Father and God the Mother, as these resonated with their own ancient traditions.
But Mari could feel that their time here would be relatively brief. More and more often, her dreams were filled with images of mountains --- not these African highlands, but the towering peaks of the Himalaya. Kashmir called to her, its pull growing stronger with each passing day.
One night, as she sat meditating under the stars, the sensation of Iesous' presence became almost overwhelming. The air around her seemed to shimmer with light, and she could have sworn she heard his voice, clear as temple bells:
"The time approaches, beloved one. The seeds we've planted are taking root everywhere --- in Egypt, in Ethiopia, in lands you haven't yet seen. Seeds planted by ships lost at sea and finding shore in places no maps know. But the greatest flowering will begin in Kashmir. Are you ready?"
"I am," she whispered to the star-filled night. "Though my heart trembles at what may come."
"Don't be afraid," the presence seemed to say. "Remember --- love is stronger than death. What's coming is more beautiful than anything you can imagine."
A cool breeze stirred the leaves of the courtyard trees, carrying the scent of night-blooming jasmine. Tomorrow, she would begin preparing for the next phase of their journey. But for now, Mari sat in the deepening darkness, her heart full of wonder at how theWAY continued to unfold, like a lotus opening its petals one by one, revealing new beauty with each unfolding.
She smiled, recognizing his touch in the wind, his message in the fragrance. Yes, the time was approaching --- not just for her journey's end, but for a new beginning that would transform the world.
In the distance, a night bird called, its song pure and piercing in the darkness. Tomorrow, they would continue to prepare for the trip to India.
But for now, beneath the vast African sky, Mari felt the first stirrings of the great change that awaited them all. The preparations in Aksum would require more than just physical arrangements --- they would need to ready their souls for what was to come.
Chapter 22
## The Map
The preparations for their journey to Kashmir took several weeks. The King of Kings of Aksum himself provided guides and resources, understanding the importance of their mission. "Our seers speak of a great light that will soon dawn in the East," he told Mari. "We must do our part to help carry this wisdom forward."
He continued, "There was a request to make a statue of you and your two chief helpers to help the nation remember the teaching in the future. What is your word on that, Mother?"
Mari said, "My king, it is our custom to engrave not on stone but in the heart and teachings, the faces and energies of those dearest to us. We don't make temples, for gods don't live there, they live in heaven and in our hearts. This way, we don't travel to worship, we sit under a tree and travel inside, and there we find Heaven and all the deities who truly exist. For People of theWAY, our spiritual Path is not an elite circle, a sign to wear, a uniform, or any external show of affiliation; it is all inside and how we live life as it comes. This way, no matter our culture or history, no matter the politics and religious rulers, no matter the place we sit to worship --- we visit the heart-mind and we connect to whomsoever deity we have a relationship with. In my heart, I have the Lord Iesous. He is but a single thought away, closer than a step, closer to me than my hand. It is our way to not make idols, but we do make spaces where we like to meet. We place flowers, a fragrance, a butterfly wing, a feather, a shell, or a pebble, anything, on an altar that is temporary for the moment, a meeting place between devotee and deity, for the moment. I too am a thought away, a small prayer away, from my students."
The King said, "Mother, that is how I understood it. I was urged, by the wives and maidens to check with you. They wanted to send someone to place a statue at the black rock in Mecca."
Mari smiled, "My king, I am certain the black rock is special but it's a rock. No spirit-deity will even inhabit a rock or people who worship it. Soul-beings do that to enjoy the worship of soul-people. We worship spirit-deities my king. Rocks are rocks, and they are wonderful. But one vibration from our Lord chanting a mantra will shatter the black rock, it is no more of a holy place than the beautiful mountain that embrace your palace."
The king informed Mari that her caravan will take them to the port city and from there they will sail to the port in India. Mari could not comprehend that. She thought she would have to travel all the way back to Aqaba to sail to India.
The afternoon light slanted through the high windows of the king's private study, catching motes of frankincense smoke that drifted up from copper burners. This was Aksum's glory --- the deep red-gold light unique to this highland plateau, the air itself seeming to hold both the warmth of Africa and the crispness of mountain heights.
"Here, let me show you," said the king while taking parchment and ink. He made a map for Mari to visualize the route and understand where she was in the world.
The ink was special --- brought by traders from China, its deep black gleam holding hints of blue when it caught the light. She watched his sure hands move across the cream-colored parchment, the fresh ink's metallic scent mixing with the room's perpetual perfume of myrrh and ancient scrolls.
He drew a picture of the Red Sea with its legs, Africa on one side and Arabia on the other side. The scratching of the reed pen on parchment was like quiet music.
He made a picture of the Nile River and put a special mark where Philae is located. He put Jerusalem in the picture. He showed her how the ship sails over the Red Sea and then hugs the land around Southern Arabia, then crosses over to touch land at ports along the Indian coast, until they reach the mouth of the Indus and port at Barbarikon. From there, she will receive help to travel up the Indus river route to Kashmir and Srinagar.
"Wait," said the king, "let's make a mark for Srinagar." He dropped ink on the location and blotted it with fine red sand from a small copper box on his desk. "Oh, wait," he said, getting carried away. "Here," he scribbled, "are the mountains, and up there\... s the Himalaya mountains. There!"
It will take no more than three weeks if the weather is in their favor.
The room itself spoke of Aksum's unique position between worlds --- Persian carpets on cool tile floors, Greek scrolls in wooden cases along one wall, while through the window came the sound of priests chanting in Ge'ez from the nearby church. The king's cloak was of the finest cotton India could produce, but dyed in the deep purple that was Aksum's signature, made from shells found only along their Red Sea coast.
Mari held the map in trembling hands. The parchment was smooth on one side, slightly rougher where the ink had been applied, carrying that distinctive animal scent that all new parchment held.
The thick black lines of coastline stood proud, on the surface --- she could feel them under her fingertips as she traced the familiar routes. Here and there, dried sand from the ink-blotter caught the light like tiny gems.
The king's study was high in his palace, and through the windows came the endless song of highland birds, the distant bleating of the famous long-horned Aksum cattle, the call of traders in the marketplace below. The light changed as clouds moved across the sun, making the ink lines seem to move on the parchment, like the routes themselves were alive with memory.
This was Aksum, where Africa met Arabia met India met Rome --- all of it there in the king's study with its mixture of scents and sounds and textures. And now here was her whole life laid out on a piece of parchment, every step of her journey with the Lord made real in ink and sand, the vastness of it suddenly comprehensible in a way that made her heart break open.
Mari held that map like the most precious thing she had held in decades. She saw a map of the routes and places, for the first time, and it all become overwhelmingly real to her. She traced with her fingers the routes she travelled with the Lord. Over the mountains, down the rivers, by camel, through the desert, by ship, by foot. In her mind, she travelled all those places again.
Her tears fell on the fresh ink --- not enough to smear it, but enough to make the parchment buckle slightly where they landed.
The king's cloak smelled of frankincense and the particular spice blend that only Aksumite kings were allowed to use --- cinnamon, cardamom, and something else she couldn't identify. The fabric was soft against her face as she cried into his shoulder, its deep purple now darker where her tears fell.
Something inside Mari moved her to a point of intense emotion that caught her off guard. Mari cried like she had not done in years. She held the map, and cried the king's royal cloak sopping wet. Some of it were sobs she should have cried when she was ten years old, and twelve, and at fifteen, some sobs were buried for later crying, from the crucifixion, and from the pain she saw in people during the healings. The news said a million people were slaughtered in Jerusalem. Mari bawled like a baby.
Mari felt so ashamed.
Every time she thought she had control over the sobs and nasal monsoon, her diaphragm tucking, tucking, and she controls it, only for her eye to catch the name Kashmir on the map, and there she goes again.
The king was a good dad, husband of several wives, grandad, uncle, counsellor, and king. He sat on the floor with Mari crying on his strong, manly shoulder. Her old body shaking, broken inside. The seventy-year-old woman missed out on a dad, missed out on ever having had a lover. The only man she ever loved dearly, is now a god who lives in heaven. Mari started laughing in between the sobs at just how ironic that was.
"I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I don't know where that comes from," she blurted, her nose running, her eyes puffy and streaming those particular tears of release.
The king said, "Mother. This is a good lesson for you before the great event comes."
Mari stopped and looked up at him, puzzled. "I, I, don't see the lesson yet."
The king of kings of Aksum, took her beautifully snotty old face in his hands, and said in his strong and wise voice, "Mother, who heals the healer?"
Chapter 23
## The 2nd 4th
The mountain passes would be treacherous until spring in Kashmir, so they waited, using the time to strengthen themselves and prepare. Mari felt the delay keenly, like an ache in her soul, but she understood the wisdom of patience.
She made everyone write a long treatise about something she neglected to address in all her spiritual instructions, for decades. "Who heals the Healer," was the title of the treatise. They all promised to send copies to Aqaba, Philae, Judea, and Galilee.
"They're becoming more vivid," she confided to Ruth one evening as they walked in the temple gardens. The air was sweet with flowering herbs, and the setting sun turned the great stelae to pillars of fire. "Not just dreams now, but visions. I see crowds gathering in Kashmir, people coming from all directions, waiting for something magnificent. And always, always that sense of a gateway opening\..."
Ruth had learned to listen deeply to such things. "The Lord is preparing the way," she said softly. "Just as he did before, sending the three wise men to Bethlehem. Things also changed in the aether that time. My father said he felt it. He lived in Bethlehem. He said the King's men killed a lot of male babies that time."
Mari nodded, touching a flowering branch as they passed. "Yes, but this time it's different. Bigger. As if\..." she paused, searching for words to describe what she sensed. "As if the whole world is about to change, to transform like a caterpillar, shedding its old skin. Or, maybe even like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis."
Their small group had shifted again --- some choosing to remain in Aksum to establish teaching centers, while others, including several Aksumite scholars, asked to join their journey east. Mari welcomed them, understanding that this weaving together of different traditions and peoples was part of the greater pattern. And... the King of Aksum was paying the way.
Finally, as winter released its grip and the first warm winds began to blow, they set out. Mari had her map. She showed everyone, more than once.
Ruth said with a pan face, "Mother, please don't show the captain the map."
Mari searched her face for meaning, intent, humor, \... but nothing... "I will when he gets lost."
Their eyes smiled at one another.
Stars filled the nights of their journey, seeming to pulse with meaning, though they knew this meaning resided within their hearts, not the stars. But, it's nice to think the stars pulse with the meaning in their hearts, why not.
Mari would often sit awake, watching Sirius rise, feeling Iesous' presence grow stronger with each passing day. Sometimes she would catch glimpses of other realities overlaying this one --- shimmers of light, fragments of celestial music, faces of beings that seemed to be made of pure radiance.
"The veil grows thinner," she explained to her companions when they noticed these phenomena too. "Just as he said it would. The gateway isn't just opening in one place --- it's opening everywhere, in every heart that's ready to receive it. I wonder for how long it will be open. It has been calling us from all over for a long time now. Wonder. When it opens. For how long?..."
Drawing closer to Srinagar, nearing the end of their long and exhausting journey to the kingdom of Kashmir, became a tangible reality for them.
The smell of the food on the way made Mari want to cry again. She could not stop herself from asking for a bite, or buying something, even though not hungry, and making Ruth taste everything, no matter how she pulled her face.
"Come, come. This is a roti. Ruth, look! roti," she would call.
"Mother, it's a flat bread. We ate the same thing together in Jerusalem, and everywhere else," would be Ruth's attempt to get to Mari's rational mind. Yet, when she tasted it, she had to agree, its different. Not the same wheat, different.
Local people often addressed Mother Mari as Acharya. The woman wanted to know why? Was it related to the mango achar she made them taste? "It means teacher," explained Mari. "But, also sir or madam. You will learn. Sanskrit is all about context. It also means conduct, agreeing with your teacher, or institute of learning --- delivering a strong extract of wisdom. So, yes, the word makes its way to that pungent mango achar infusion, that stains your cloth."
Saran, one of the Aksum young ladies, asked, "Mother, what is a must-try dish in Kashmir? Something unique to the area."
Mari wanted to say all of it, but the wise teacher in her took over from the joyful homesick woman. She said, "Modu Palao. You will want to write a poem when you ate it. Its flavors come alive with the addition of milk, saffron, dry fruits, raw sugar, and a blend of fragrant spices such as cinnamon and cardamom. With every bite, you can taste the heavenly combination of ghee, full cream milk, and a generous serving of dried fruits and nuts. The recipe calls for saffron, a spice that is grown only in Kashmir --- you will love it."
The river Indus, they say, it is boisterous like a young boy on a joy rampage. Trying to find a quiet pool to wash is a challenge. I know it's Spring, but everything's so very alive, and the energies are moving more than before.
On the way, walking up the banks of the river to Kashmir where it starts, they began meeting others heading in the same direction --- Buddhist monks from Parthia and China, yogis from India, philosophers from Greece, all drawn by dreams and visions of something momentous about to unfold in Kashmir. Many joined their caravan, adding their own wisdom and perspectives to the growing synthesis.
Their group had grown quite large now, incorporating people from many traditions. Mari noticed how the distinctions between their various paths seemed to be dissolving naturally, as if they were all streams flowing into the same great river. Jewish mystics sat with Buddhist monks discussing the nature of reality, venturing far away from the scriptures of their organized religions. Neoplatonist, Gnostics, and classic Greek philosophers and Hindu yogis compared their understanding of the soul's journey, all free from the confines of the prescriptions of their traditions.
One evening, as they made camp near an ancient caravanserai, a group of Buddhist monks shared their reasons for coming. The King of Kashmir funded a "Worldwide Council of People of the Buddha Religion", is what they called it. But, they explained, the previous council was the 4th one since the passing of Siddhartha Gautama Buddha. The 4th one in more than 500 years.
"So," said a toothless old monk to Ruth. "Guess what this one is called."
"Um, the 5th one? I guess," she said to play along.
The monks laughed heartily at their inside joke. "No," said the toothless one, "You would think, but no. The 4th one was called many years ago, but nobody came, so it didn't happen. Of course, then, this one is called," he sits upright to say it in his official voice, "The 2nd 4th Worldwide Council of People of the Buddha Religion."
The monks laughed and laughed, and made the, "hey. hey" elbow prompt gesture, wanting everyone to join in the merriment, the funniest joke they heard that century.
Mari asked another monk who had stopped laughing, "Are you saying monks are coming to Kashmir, from all over the world, right now?"
"Yes, Mother," answered the man with the orange robe and ponytail in a broken Greek. I am from Kambuja. All the leaders are coming.
One from Parthia, who had more Greek, joined. He explained the purpose of the Council is actually highly important. They believe the movement must move in an entirely new direction, or the movement must split. But they expect the old guard will fight to stay true to the old, but wrong way. For the past twenty years or so, the devotees have become concerned that the monks are hoarding the teaching --- they have been saying for ages now, that only monks can achieve nirvana, and women will never achieve nirvana. Women are banned from many pagodas, and if a woman touches a monk, she gets into trouble because he must do ritual washing to cleanse himself. Also, only prayers done by monks reach heaven.
They want reform, and they have been campaigning for it for the past ten years. The Wayist king of Kashmir, he is paying for it. His father is a Buddhist, but he is a Wayist.
The more eloquent monk reminds the others that there is the matter of the new book. "A small new sutra, they call it the Lotus Sutra, was discovered last month. Nobody ever saw it before. It has a chapter about a great being of light, Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of Compassion, who will appear to all people," he said with gravitas, "teaching the Way of universal compassion. He will appear to all people who call on him, and he will appear as any of the gods, and he will even appear as a woman, yes, in any form, and he lives in Sukhavati with Buddha Siddhartha and Father Amitabha and Mother Pandarajanana. He vowed to remain accessible in the Earth realm until all senior souls have achieved immortality."
One man in the back said, "What! a woman Buddha? I don't believe that. A Buddha cannot be a woman."
A chill ran up Mari's spine. There was something more than just eerily familiar about how the man told about that book. She knew, this was the second coming of the Lord the Buddhists are talking about. She thought to herself, "It will be so wonderful if Buddhism accepts that sutra without a lot of changes. Won't it be terribly beautiful if women are treated right, for once, in Buddhism. Oh, I so hope they are successful in the reformation.
Mari wondered what was happening right now among the Christians, now with the second coming of the Lord. She hoped, especially after seeing almost a million people slaughtered in Jerusalem, that there is a lot of repentance and they all feel the change.
A Shaivite priest chimed in with a stern voice, "He will ruin the temples and pagodas. People won't come for prayers and blessings anymore. If that book is accepted and people read it, they will pray at home, by themselves, they will not need us. What will you guys eat? What! Tell me? What money will come to my temple? Nah\... We must stop this thing. Why change? Why always change!"
Mari smiled, remembering how Iesous had always pointed these things out to the priests and monks. And now it's happening. She thought, quietly to herself,
"What they see as bankrupting their business, the Lord sees as liberating all people worldwide, empowering them to seek and find heaven inside, to own your own mind, and pray and sing with the deities of heaven, all on your own. To have your own home shrine, place your flower there in your own home."
Mari leaned in and said to the Buddhist with the better Greek language, "But the pagodas have the merit wheels, that makes money? Or not?"
He said, "That is true but not all pagodas have them. They are expensive. And they compete with one another. One has a wheel with 1,000 "Om Mani" mantras inside, and people come far, and pay, to spin the wheel. Then, another pagoda makes a 3,000 "Om Mani mantra" wheel. 3,000 karmic merits for every spin of the wheel, now, people don't go to the 1,000 wheel pagoda anymore. Its not easy."
Mari thought back to the ruckus with the Lord in the Temple, taking a whip to the money dealers. He accused the Jews, the nation into which he was born, of controlling banks and foreign exchange and loaning money at huge interest, purposely causing farmers and countries to go bankrupt, in that way getting ownership of their assets. He was particularly disgusted to see it happening even in their Temple. And she reflected on Christians paying sin taxes to priests for forgiveness, with normal human thoughts and feelings deemed vile and sinful --- thus taxable.
It is like having to sacrifice a pigeon or goat to the god to offer the burnt offering, that smoke from the burnt blood, to the god for forgiveness so they don't get tortured in eternity --- their sins are passed into the animal, so they become clean.
The stars wheeled overhead, while in the distance, camp fires dotted the landscape like earthbound stars, marking other groups of pilgrims all moving toward the same destination. The air itself seemed charged with expectation, and even those who didn't understand what was coming could feel that something extraordinary was about to unfold.
In her heart, Mari felt both excitement and a kind of sacred dread. Whatever lay ahead would change not just her life, but the very fabric of reality itself.
Yet she trusted, remembering his words: "Love is stronger than death. What comes next is more beautiful than anything you can imagine."
Chapter 24
## Yusmarg
As they moved through the mountainside, ascending from sea level up the path up the highest mountain known to people, the landscape gradually transformed from plains to the first hints of the mountains ahead. The horses were well used to the path and the climb; they had grown up there and enjoyed the change in diet and scenery. In fact, they would stop to eat when they see some nutrition they need. The caravan drivers respected the needs of the horses.
Each dawn revealed peaks a little higher, a little closer, until finally the great wall of the Himalayas to the north dominated the horizon. Mari felt her heart leap at the sight --- these were the mountains she had seen in her visions, the Himalayas she knew so well, but never before seen from a distance from the southwestern approach. Their snow-capped summits touching heaven itself, far ahead, veiling their beauty from careless observers in a secretive mist.
The closer they drew to the Vale of Kashmir, the more travelers they encountered on the road. Some were clearly pilgrims like themselves, drawn by dreams and prophecies. Others were merchants and traders who spoke of strange phenomena in the valley --- lights in the sky, music that seemed to come from the air itself, children speaking of visions. Many were traders bringing goods. There was big business up ahead.
"The whole world is awakening. Almost every religion is shaken. I hear the Bhakti tradition, of direct worship of deities is all of a sudden very popular, awakened Lord Krishna from his slumber, as they say," Mari told her companions one evening, as they sat around their fire.
The spring air was crisp with the scent of pine and distant snow. "Can you feel it? It's like the moment just before sunrise, when the whole earth holds its breath in anticipation."
Ruth, who had grown even more sensitive to such things during their journey, nodded. "The very stones seem to be singing," she said softly. "And last night, I dreamed of lotus flowers blooming in the snow. I know it's not possible, but that was in the dream."
One morning, as they began their ascent into the mountains proper, Mari woke before dawn with a certainty that Iesous was near. The air around her seemed to shimmer with his presence, and she caught the faint scent of lotus flowers, though none grew at this altitude.
"It's time, isn't it?" she whispered to the pre-dawn darkness.
The response came not in words but in a wave of love so intense it brought tears to her eyes. Yes, it was time. The gateway was opening, just as he had promised. What had begun with his death and resurrection in Jerusalem would now be completed in a way that would transform not just individual lives but the very nature of reality itself.
As the sun rose over the mountains, painting the spring-snow peaks silver and gold and rose, Mari gathered her companions. "What comes next," she told them, "Will require all our courage and all our faith. But remember --- we're not just witnesses to this transformation. We're part of it. Each of us carries a spark of the divine fire that's about to blaze forth."
"What will happen, Mother?" asked Surya, a Wayist pilgrim from Calicut whom they met in the port, "we must know to be ready for it."
Mari said in earnest, "I don't know, my child. I truly don't know. But there will be miracles. Be sure to not blink or you will miss something important. Be sure to hold steadfast as we taught you, "when the gates of heaven open and close..." She waited for them to complete the phase. "...can you hold steadfast," they said in chorus.
"Yes. The gates of heaven will open and close as your concentration and spiritual awareness in spirit-minds hold your connection to what is holy. Remain steadfast. If you are invited in, go with resolve. Cry later, break down and crumble at the feet of deities in awe, later. First, the journey. This is not. I repeat, this is not the simple journey you have made so many times before, when your bodies die you flow in awe to Paradise. No its more. This is a thousand times more powerful. Think only of yourself. There is no danger to anyone. Think of yourself and stay focussed in spirit-minds, forget about soul-minds when it happens."
"When what happens, Mother?" Surya whispered with a quiz on her brow.
"She does not know Surya. We don't know. Nobody knows. Just be ready," said Ruth.
Mari quickly said, "Surya, if you ask, 'how can you be ready if you don't know', I promise you..."
Surya smiled, "I get it, Mother. I get it. I will think with another mind, a higher-mind."
Ruth said with a smile, teasing her, "You could have said those wise words in the beginning. So the teachers also know. Are all people from Calicut like that; they know the answer and ask questions to test their teachers?"
The path ahead wound up through mountain-grass slopes, and forests of cedar and pine, each turn revealing new vistas of breathtaking beauty. Birds called in voices Mari had never heard before, and sometimes she caught glimpses of other beings --- not quite physical --- moving among the trees. The veil between worlds, or the perception of people, was growing thinner with each step they took toward Kashmir.
"Look," Ruth said suddenly, pointing ahead. A figure stood on the path above them, glowing with its own inner light. As they watched, it smiled and beckoned, then disappeared like morning mist in sunshine.
"One of the messengers?" Mari said softly. "They're everywhere now, helping to prepare the way. Why here, on the road? Soon\..." she paused, her heart full of wonder and anticipation, "Soon we'll all see with eyes of spirit, and the gateway will open fully."
When they reached that spot in the road where the messenger stood, they were high up in the mountain. The air was thin and breathing was hard to do. They decided to make a rest stop and sat down on the side of the road.
That was when Mari noticed something very familiar about the surroundings. A house with smoke from the chimney. A simple little place, but familiar. She knew that house. But from where? When?
Mari stood up and walked around. She had been here before. The door of the house opened and an older woman, hunched over from her bad back, came out and greeted. Mari went up to her and exchanged pleasantries. "Sister, what is this place? What is it called?"
The old woman said, "Yusmarg," and she waved down the valley. Mari realized she is a nomadic herder. They travel from Jammu to Srinagar to graze their goats and sheep, and they have several settlements all along the mountain range --- gypsies is what people call them.
Mari didn't get it, though. She had never heard the name. "Why is it called Yusmarg, what happens here?"
"Oh. Nothing much," she said in her Kashmiri tongue, which Mari could put together because it was a mix of the two languages from greater India that she speaks, "it's a holy place, you know. Lord Yesu preached here. Blessed the place. Now, pilgrims like you come here for the blessings, and everyone calls it Yusmarg, the meadow valley of Lord Yesu."
"Lord Yesu?" her heart jumped in her throat. Now she recalled memories. "Lord Yesu?, the teacher from\..." the old woman completed her sentence, "Yes, the blue eyed one from heaven. He had a young girl with him, from Srinagar. People came. He taught them. Healed. He even baptized people down\..." Mari completed her sentence, "...down by the big rocks in the river, at the bottom of the valley. They sat in rows on the rocks and he stood in the water, teaching us."
The bent-over woman looked at Mari deeply, intently. "Yes... yes," she nodded her head with a knowing, "and he made tea for you, for your monthly, in my father's house, here\... yes."
The two old women laughed, hugged and kissed. Jivantika and Mari went inside. They made tea, yet again. Mari told her all about the Lord, and about Judaism, and the cross, about the new energy from heaven, a new gateway, or something like a new way for people.
"I'm ready to go, Mari. Please take me with you. I'm ready to go. Been waiting right here for him ever since. I knew he would come back; I knew it. Always."
"Srinagar is a hard two days walk, I don't think you can," started Mari.
Jivantika said, "My sons will bring the horses. We go by horse. We have many and the sheep are fine. Enough men out there to take care of them." And before Mari could answer, she put two fingers to her mouth and let out a shriek of a whistle that can strip the enamel off a wisdom tooth. Wherever the men were, who were just called, they would have heard that whistle.
Jivantika spoke, mostly to herself as she started looking around for what to pack and prepare for the trip, "Good. Done then. Tomorrow morning, we ride, early. Call your people, let's go get eggs and make dinner. The men will need food when they come in. They sit and play nonsense out there in the valleys, watch the sheep, do nothing the whole day, come back hungry."
The group of women stayed over in that little one-room house, in Yusmarg.
The next morning, and after a hearty gypsy-style breakfast: naan, sausage and dhal, and strong sweet chai, they were ready to take the road down to Srinagar. Now that they use the animals for transport, because it's mostly downhill, all the way down to Dal Lake, they might even get close, very close to the end of their journey.
As they started the slow and curvy descent, the majestic mountains soared around them, their peaks lost in clouds that seemed to shimmer with more than natural light. Mari felt her soul expanding with each step, as if it too, were preparing for something magnificent.
The air so thin, getting oxygen was hard to do. Looking down to where the city would be did not help because they were above clouds. The view was of the tops of clouds. But somehow, the air was richer too, charged with an energy that made even the most mundane moments feel sacred. More and more often now, they encountered signs and wonders --- lights dancing in the evening sky, music that seemed to come from the rocks themselves, visions that appeared to entire groups at once.
"It's like the dimensions are becoming transparent, all is not separated like before," Ruth observed as they watched the sunrise paint impossible colors across the snow peaks. "As if we can see through the physical to what lies beyond."
Mari nodded, understanding completely. Her own awareness had expanded dramatically in recent days. Sometimes she could see the light bodies of their companions overlaying their physical forms, or catch glimpses of beings made of pure radiance moving among them. The boundary between soul and matter, between spirit and matter, between heaven and earth, was gossamer thin.
The caravans going to Srinagar had grown into something extraordinary --- moving a city-size group of seekers from every tradition and corner of the world. At night, their campfires stretched across the mountainsides like earthbound stars, while actual stars blazed overhead with unprecedented brilliance. Sirius, in particular, seemed to pulse with meaning, as if sending messages Mari could almost, but not quite, decode --- even though she knew the flickers were just optical anomalies, she liked the idea of it being code.
A rider from Jivantika's group arrived from ahead --- one of the scouts they'd sent to assess the path. His face was alight with wonder.
"The valley," he said, barely able to catch his breath, "it's full of people. Thousands upon thousands, gathered from everywhere. And the light there\... it's like nothing I've ever seen."
Mari felt her heart leap. This was what she'd seen in her visions --- the great gathering, the preparation for something magnificent. She could feel Iesous' presence stronger than ever, not just as a comfort now but as an almost tangible force transforming the very air around them.
"How far?" she asked.
"Five hours, perhaps three if we push hard, depending on the weather. But\..." he hesitated, looking at the sky, "the weather itself seems to be cooperating. The passes that should be snow-blocked are clear. It's as if the mountains themselves are helping us. But, there be no room to sleep. Way too many people."
Mari suggested they move on and look for a place to sleep over, and in the morning enter the city when the commotion was not so urgent.
The group settled for the night in a small town, about three hours from Srinagar. Mari walked a little away from the camp to watch the stars emerge. The air was crystal clear, carrying the scent of snow and cedar, and something else --- that familiar fragrance of lotus flowers that always heralded Iesous' presence, especially when there were no such plants in the area.
Chapter 25
## Dal Lake
"Good evening, Lord. We're almost there, aren't we?" she whispered to the presence she felt so strongly. "The gateway you spoke of\... it's not just a metaphor, is it? What is my role, what must I do when we get there? Must we go into the city? What must I do when we get there?"
Again, for Mari, the stars seemed to pulse an answer as she connected in her Ajna-mind, and a knowing flowed into her.
Through her expanded awareness, she perceived a knowing flowing into her, Gently whispering in her soul, 'Mari. The universal gateway of enlightenment is an enhanced version of the metaphysical systems that Butterfly Path used before. For now, in this initial period, the gateway opens tangibly for minutes every day, at different times. This is only temporary while we change the system.
All over the world people experience it, some are pulled through to the other side. Most don't understand what is happening. Many get tremendous soul-growth and many get enlightenment. And the only reason you, Mari, were called here is to see the core and experience the magnificence of it. You have no task to complete for this to happen, your tasks were all completed before you left Aksum. You are now on your holy-days. Do the final work on yourself. Teachers work so hard to help others, often they don't get time to do their own self-craft. Enjoy Earth and say your goodbyes.'
Mari experienced a moment of existential crisis. She smiled at herself, for feeling it, marvelling at the soul's fragile ego in its Svadhisthana mind, even of the most advanced of souls, the soul speaks.
Thoughts rang through her mind, "No task? I don't have a role to play? The Lord brought me all the way up here, up the mountain, to show me something? So, this duality remains, soul and spirit. When does the two become one? Oh, at rebirth in heaven, buddhas, deities, teach us, then the soul is fully sanctified. We have to be born again and in heaven, the schooling is finalized. Why is it I have been teaching these words for years, but I get understanding of it in layers upon layers? Oh, that is the mercy, the compassion. We do not become perfect while on Earth --- we are reborn in Heaven, not Paradise, in Heaven, and there the deities train us in the high spiritual skills and only then does perfection embrace and empower us. I know that. I teach that. But now I see more clearly. How wonderful it is to grow in spirit just like plants grow into fruition, layer upon layer, step by step\..."
"Your chai, Mother," Ruth interrupted Mari's learning moment with loving-kindness.
Mari thanked her and looked Ruth over with deep love. She said gently, "Sit here, Ruth darling, next to me. You know my past. I never had a husband, never made my own family home, or children from my womb. But Heaven gave me you as my daughter. My dearest, and not only for a few months, to then go away and make your own life. No, you remained and brought me years of companionship and friendship. I love you so much. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for many years together through the hard times and sharing precious moments. Remember, death of the body is not an end, it's a gateway."
Ruth was touched, but confused, "Why are you saying beautiful love and then about death of the body. Where are you going? When?"
Mari pulled her closer and held her, speaking into the darkness, "Not me. Not where am I going. Where are "we" going?"
Ruth's body reacted, stiffening. "We're dying? Where 'are' we going?"
"I don't know how to speak to that. I trust, and so should you, the Lord will make it beautiful, better than here," said Mari.
Ruth smiled and nodded in agreement, "Here is wonderful too."
"Sure," said Mari under her breath, "but I think I have had enough of living where the gods are cruel, and hearts are divisive. There are good people, but the soul-people exploit the world. I think I want to go home now."
For a moment, the mountain air shimmered with shapes of light --- beings of pure radiance moving between heaven and earth as naturally as breathing. Mari caught her breath at their beauty, understanding that soon such sights would be normal, not just for her but for anyone with eyes to see.
Mari looked at the faces of the people moving about --- Wayists refugees from Judea, Egyptian scholars, Buddhist monks, Greeks, Hindus, women, so many women young and old by themselves, Bhakti yogis, Jaina, and so many others --- she saw not fear but contentment, expectation, anticipation, not doubt but wonder. They had come so far, not just in physical distance, but in spiritual understanding. They were ready, but no-one knew for what. The question on everyone's lips was, "What is happening?"
The path down to Dal Lake wound ever downward, each turn offering new wonders to eyes made fresh by time and transformation. The crisp morning air carried the purity of mountain ice-melt, while memories of evening breezes laden with cooking spices and humble hearth-smoke tugged at Mari's heart. She never appreciated this beauty during her years of captivity --- then, Kashmir had been only pain and shadow. But now, watching white dots of sheep and goats move across the verdant mountainside like stars wheeling in slow motion, she saw the valley through new eyes.
Solomon's Temple crowned its mount, the modest Shaivite shrine that had gained its grander name from the Lord's teachings there about the true wealth of the heart. The massive wooden structures of Srinagar emerged from the morning mist --- temples and homes built of heavy beams that breathed with the seasons, their weathered faces telling stories of countless winters and springs. The city itself seemed to know its place, nestling along one side of the lake rather than challenging the steep mountain faces that rose like guardians around it.
Along the lake's edge, lotus flowers opened their faces to the dawn, their pink and white blossoms a living carpet that local devotees would soon come to harvest, their roots sustaining the body as their beauty fed the soul. The air held that peculiar clarity that comes with altitude, making distant things seem close enough to touch. Through gaps in the morning mist, they could see the valley below --- a green jewel set among the mountains, the busy commerce of the Jhelum's banks a distant hum beyond the peaceful heart of the city. Already the landscape seemed to glow with more than natural light, as if the gateway's opening had begun to transform the physical world.
For the first time, Mari understood why this place had always drawn those seeking peace --- not the wealthy pleasure-seekers whose coin had once bought her slavery, but genuine seekers who found in Kashmir's embrace a touch of heaven's serenity. The same mountains that had once seemed prison walls now stood like ancient teachers, their snow-capped heads bright with wisdom.
Mari felt her own transformation deepening with each step. The boundary between her physical and spiritual awareness was dissolving, allowing her to perceive multiple levels of reality simultaneously. She knew now that the portal, the gateway, is all over, but the Lord wants for her to experience it here in Srinagar.
Maybe, maybe to make peace with the city? Maybe to experience it as a holy place, even though she knows the depravity of monks and priests, officials and businesspeople and their wives who see your suffering but spit on you. Yes, that is why, she knew in her heart, whispering in her soul, "The great mother Mari, spiritual teacher of thousands. She is not pure, she is not yet ready. She has work to do before her rebirth can happen."
"The brothels must be so busy now," the thought came to Mari.
"Ruth!" she called out, surprising herself that she was so loud and urgent. Ruth came running.
"No no, No, not to worry. Ruth. Its not urgent, sorry. Listen, tomorrow, we enter the city and go to the brothels. That is what we must do."
"And do what there, Mother?" Ruth asked, her brow puzzled.
"Just be kind. Gently flow healing energy to them. They don't want our pity; they want nothing but to survive the day and exist. They are empty vessels, blocking all goodness, distrusting kindness. You can flow healing energies to them without them knowing," said Mari.
"Yes Mother, but why? We didn't do that in any other city, why here?"
"For me. That we didn't do it in any other city, is my fault. Tomorrow, you do it for me. I have work to do on myself," said Mari.
Ruth looked at the greatest teacher and healer in the world at the time. Thousands revere and honor the woman. Myths and stories about her abound. People want to erect monuments and idols in her image. Ruth's heart broke, as she said, "Who heals the healer? Oh, Mother, I am so sorry..."
It was Ruth's turn to cry, to sob, years and years she received from Mari, and people relied on her, demanding her energy and attention. "But did anyone think of her?"
Ruth knew, what must be done in Kashmir will complete this process not just for her, but for Mother Mari of Magadha, and perhaps everyone here. That is why all who were called, gathered here to do that final work on their self. And the energies running around so wildly tangible now, is making it all easier for them. All who would be ready, will receive it.
The mountains soared around them, their peaks now seeming to merge with the light of heaven itself. The greatest travel adventure of all was about to begin, the final journey inside and then to heaven.
As they made their final descent into the Valley, the air itself seemed to vibrate with anticipation.
Their small band of pilgrims made an unlikely sight --- weathered women from lands as distant as Egypt and East Africa, each carrying stories of transformation in their lined faces. Among them walked the bent-over grandmother from Yusmarg who had once served tea to the Lord, her ancient eyes bright with recognition of what was to come. The morning light held an unusual quality --- not just illuminating, but somehow transforming everything it touched.
Mari noticed how objects appeared to glow from within, as if their true spiritual nature was becoming visible to ordinary sight.
Their first view of the gathering crowd below took their breath away. Thousands of people assembled, their camps spreading across the valley floor like a great tapestry.
Banners and prayer flags fluttered in the breeze, while smoke from countless fires created a soft haze that seemed to shimmer with its own inner light.
As the sun climbed higher, Mari felt the familiar stirring in her heart that preceded something momentous. She had felt it first in Srinagar all those years ago, when Iesous walked into her life.
Now it returned stronger than ever, as if all the threads of destiny they had woven on their long journey were finally coming together in this valley.
Chapter 26
## Siphor and Thomas
"Look," Ruth whispered, pointing to where several large monasteries crowned the surrounding hills. "They say every major tradition is represented here --- Buddhist, Hindu, Zoroastrian, even some of the mystery schools from Greece and Egypt."
Mari nodded, feeling the rightness of it. "Just as he taught --- many paths leading to the same summit. And now\..." she paused, feeling that familiar presence growing stronger, "now they'll all see how their traditions connect, how they've always been part of something greater. Maybe now, they will stop their divisiveness --- but there are always soul-people who are attracted to positions of influence and power. Who knows what the future brings."
As they made their way down into the city, Mari began to recognize faces in the crowd --- teachers she had met in their travels, scholars who had helped preserve the teachings, simple people who had offered them shelter along the way. All had been drawn here by dreams, visions, or an inexplicable certainty that something extraordinary was about to unfold.
The air grew thicker with power as they descended, making it difficult to maintain ordinary awareness. Mari found herself shifting naturally between physical and spiritual perception, seeing both the mundane activities of the gathering and the incredible play of energies moving through and around everyone present.
"We must find a place to sleep," said Mari, "let's just walk, something will happen."
The women were buying lunch at a food stall when Ruth, ever the scholar, found herself drawn to the magnificent architecture around them. Her scroll case bumped against her hip as she moved through the crowd, her keen eyes taking in every detail of the temples and stupas. She had filled three scrolls already with observations since leaving Aksum, and Mari often teased her about her endless questions and notes. But this was different --- Srinagar was alive with an energy she'd never felt before, as if the very stones hummed with spiritual power.
Lost in contemplation of a particularly beautiful carving, she didn't realize how far she'd wandered until she heard someone speak loudly, that made her heart leap --- familiar words in foreign tongues. "Lord Yesu!" rang out in Greek, then "ten Odon" (theWAY), followed by "Oesho" meaning Yesu in Bactrian --- the same name she'd seen Mari pray before on their journey. Her merchant father had taught her to recognize trade languages, but hearing "Mahamarga" --- theWAY in Sanskrit --- made her spin around in excitement. "There are People of theWAY here, from all over," she marvelled, in awe of the great moment.
The voice speaking those words belonged to a man who commanded attention not just with his volume but with his presence. Grey-haired but vigorous, with an air of both authority and kindness, he stood on a box of sorts, addressing a crowd.
Ruth found herself moving closer, her scholar's mind already categorizing the different languages he wove together so effortlessly. When he mentioned "Thomas of Galilee", she stood on tiptoe, searching the crowd with sudden hope --- excitedly. Could their beloved Thomas be here?
"Oh that will be so wonderful. I have to tell Mother Mari" she thought. But, that's when panic struck --- she had no idea where Mari and the others were. The marketplace had become a maze of unfamiliar faces. Her confident teacher's demeanor fell away, revealing her eighteen-year-old girl beneath as she called out in her distinctively Galilean voice, "Mother Mari! Mother Mari!"
"Mother Mari! Mother Mari!," she yelled on top of her voice, looking around frantically.
The speaker stopped mid-sentence, his keen eyes finding her immediately. As his audience turned to stare, Ruth felt her face flush --- she who was usually so composed, so careful.
A woman shushed her sharply, and a man grabbed her arm, muttering something hostile. But before fear could take hold, the speaker was there, his presence creating a small bubble of calm in the chaos.
"Who is this Mother Mari you're looking for?" he asked in perfect Greek, his voice gentler now, but still carrying that note of authority.
Relief flooded through Ruth at hearing her native tongue. Words tumbled out as she tried to explain about Mari, she's old, the food stalls, horses, their journey from Aksum. She was babbling, she knew it, but couldn't seem to stop until he raised his hand and said sternly, "I hear you. But I asked. Who, is this Mother, Mari?"
The question helped Ruth find her center. Drawing herself up, she spoke as the teacher she was becoming: "Sir. She walked with Lord Yesu, was with him at the cross. She comes from here, from Srinagar, though she taught us in Jerusalem and\..."
She didn't finish. The man had grabbed her hands, tears streaming unashamedly down his dignified face, "Oh God. She's here? Impossible! Where? Where?"
His next words boomed out over the crowd: "People of theWAY! Mother Mārīya of Magadha is here! Somewhere here. She's buying food. Go! Find her!"
The crowd erupted in excitement. The man kept hold of her wrist --- firmly but not unkindly --- as the sea of people surged around them. "I am Siphor," he said. "When Brother Thomas died, I took over as leader of the church up in the hills."
The words hit Ruth like a physical blow. "Thomas? He died? He's dead?" Her voice sounded small, even to herself.
"Yes," Siphor said gently. "Twenty or-so years ago. King Misdeaus had him murdered. I was a general in that king's army."
"But why?" asked Ruth. He was so kind.
"Long story. Something to do with the kings wife. Brother Thoma was not looking for a woman in his life, everyone knew he liked men, but the king's wife, he thought she loved Thoma. He didn't understand she loved theWAY and the Lord."
"Like John," said Ruth under her breath.
"What?, sorry, the crowd is noisy said Siphor.
"Oh, nothing. It's just. The Lord's prophet, John, his cousin, he also died because of the king's wife. Sometimes women can make or break anything they set their mind to," explained Ruth.
He said, "True. People don't understand the power of yin-energy is equally as strong as yang-energy. It's just less noticeable to the eye. It's how Heaven works, God the Father and God the Mother, and all of nature."
A great commotion came through the crowd and moved in their direction. Siphor got on the box to show them where he was. Like a maelstrom of people, like a hurricane moving through the ocean of people, they moved in his direction.
"That's her, they found her!" said Siphor. We must find another space; the soldiers could think we're making trouble.
Siphor, ex-general of the king's army, stood on the box and shouted instructions, pointing the group in a direction.
Ruth watched as the group came into view. They carried a grand palinka, a palanquin, and Mari was inside it, leaning out to look for Ruth among the crowd. They were chanting words that Ruth had never heard, like *mārgadarśaka mata sri Mārīya*. Later, Ruth had heard varieties of the chants and learned it meant Mother Mārīya (a name they know her by) theWAY shower, the holy one who shows theWAY.
"She's famous here," Ruth wonderingly said to herself as she waved to Mother Mari to show she's okay.
That night, they enjoyed the hospitality of the grand Wayist compound, a neighborhood more like. It was what Thomas built with King Gonophores' money for People of theWAY, who came here from the West.
Chapter 27
## That is why we hug, heart-mind to heart-mind
The following morning, too early for politeness, Mother Mari knocked on Siphor's door. She wanted to go into Srinagar and be around the area where the prostitutes work. Siphor understood. He enquired about what she had planned, to know what sort of safety measures would be required. They both agreed the women would be very busy with work, it may not be an easy thing to do. He said, "Leave it to me, let me see what can be done."
While Mari was fully occupied teaching and relating stories about the Lord while she walked with him, and the group of Wayists increasing in size and eagerness to hear and see her, Ruth made sure to be there for Mari. Not only as an assistant, but in energy. Mari noticed it, and she was moved by it.
Mari thought, "There is something different about human contact. It is as if the energy we convey through touch is ten times more effective than by non-touch transfer. That is why people would come up and touch the Lord's cloak, or stroke his arm, and be healed. That is why he would teach us to touch the body where the chakra is, to transfer energy. That is why we hug, putting heart-mind to heart mind. That is why we reach out to."
Siphor interrupted Mari's thoughts, addressing her as, Yami, a word meaning, noble Mother, "Yami, I did something. I hope you will approve. It was really the only thing possible." He continued to explain, "I sent word to the brothels that I need fifty experienced women for a day. The price was high, but we have the money. They will arrive by lunch time and leave tomorrow afternoon again. I didn't think you will be able to talk to anyone at this time, it's too busy in the city."
Mari was visibly moved by Siphor's compassion and understanding. "It must have cost a fortune. This time. Prices are so high during pilgrimages and this time there are more people than ever."
"I am glad that you approve. You must give me directions, what to do when they arrive," he said, "maybe you should meet them and talk to them, so they know what is expected of them."
Mari thought about it for a while. "No, You talk to them. Tell them they are here by invitation of God our Mother in Heaven. For a day, they must rest and just be one of us. Give them clothes, like normal people clothes. Let them clean their faces and hand markings and ankle bells. Show them where they shall sleep. Tell them nobody knows them, nobody will touch them, nobody wants anything from them, they are here to be one of us. If they steal anything at all, you will do what you do to anyone who steals in the compound --- go to court."
Siphor frowned, "So, you think they will believe me, and trust me?"
Mari smiled, "Of course not, Siphor."
On his way out, from the door, Siphor turned to ask, "Do you believe they are good people, prostitutes?"
Mari asked in return, "Do you believe there are good people among the monks and priests, and the officials?"
Siphor said, "There are some, yes."
"People know that only *some* are good people, among them. Yet they treat them all with respect," said Mari.
Siphor nodded knowingly, "But people treat all prostitutes with disrespect. I get it. Now I understand what to do. Thank you."
That evening, Mari watched as the prostitutes became part of the flow in the compound. She knew that some would try to do business, there is always a demand for sex workers. And she had too much respect for Wayist men to think that some wouldn't want to do business like that. But she also knew that a large number of those women need this break more than most people need food. Their souls have lost the desire for dignity. They have lost the sense of self to just be human. She knew it will be cruel to go back tomorrow, but she also knew that the soul sustenance they get today will feed their souls, keep them alive in self, and that may one day be important to them when they are discarded due to age or sickness. Mari thought, "I won't talk to them. I want them to just be."
But, that was wishful thinking.
Ruth came up in the early evening and asked Mari's advice. She had seen one woman with festering wounds around her ankles and she is trying to make a salve to stop the infection.
Ruth said, "It's the strangest wounds, deep cuts but also a lot of abrasion. She says it was from new shoes she tied up with leather straps."
Mari asked, "Where is she from? Is her husband here? Did she come to ask for help?
Ruth answered, "Oh, she's local, from Srinagar, has no husband. And no, I saw the marks and offered to help. She didn't want to, but then she did, I wonder why?"
Mari reached into her bag of medicines and took out two salves, "This one, clean the wounds as you know, cover the sores, and bind them. This one, she must rub into the muscles below the hip bone. Trace those meridians, the ones that cross over and end in the center of the foot. Show her how, so she can take care of herself."
Ruth thanked Mari and was about to hurry away, "Mother, how do you know so much? We have never seen this before, how do you know?"
Mari smiled, "Never you mind, go now."
It was not long after that, Ruth came back to Mari, who was trying to rest a bit. Her eyes were red, and puffy. She walked in and hugged Mari so tight it hurt, and she held on, "I am so sorry," she sobbed. "I am so sorry".
Mari decided it was necessary that she talk to the women before they leave. She knew that she would tell them everything the Lord told her about not being soiled, like the lotus, about owning your own mind and not giving them your soul, about the bonds of hate that keep you tied to their energy, about the power of hope and faith in the future that lies beyond this birth, about the companionship of good but lonely-broken men who need their healing touch to just keep their marriages and family going, about women who need a woman's touch and kiss, about how the most-broken are often the healers, about how soul-people create classes and morals but they themselves are the lower class who break their own morals and it does not touch you.
The next day, Mari and Ruth had morning tea and sweet snacks ready and they met with the prostitutes. As Mari had expected it would, there was antagonism and suspicion.
The first question surprised Ruth. A ringleader type asked Mari, "Why do you call yourself by that name? It's a bad name."
Ruth jumped in before Mari could stop her, "How can you say that? It's her name?"
"Yea, but it means death, pestilence, disease, even chili peppers. It's a bad name. No-one call their child that name," she said, and several others nodded in agreement.
Mari answered, "When my dad sold me to the brothel, he told them my name is Mari. He didn't use my full name, Mārīya. I believed I was bad, so I kept the name. When I got my freedom, the Lord of my life said he liked my name because every time he says it, it reminds him of a breeze of fresh air in heaven. He said, it's pretty. But, he said, one day when you are ready, in your heart, you call yourself by your real name. I didn't know what he meant until about two years later. I married my Lord in a dream. And in that dream, he called me Mārīya. The next morning, my Lord looked at me differently, so tenderly. And that never changed."
The room was silent for quite some time. Some wiped tears.
Ruth was out of the loop, and thought she had to keep things going, so she asked the women, in a hushed voice, to match the mood of the room, "What does Mārīya mean?"
Someone in the back, with a sweet and gentle voice, said, "It means, she who belongs to the god of love."
"What brothel?" asked the first questioner.
"Khamasu," said Mari.
The women looked around at one another; evidently some of them work there.
"His son owns the business now," said someone.
Mari said, "I hope he is better than his father."
They all turned to look at the woman with the wounds on her ankles. "He is not," she said.
Mari knew the ice was broken, trust was earned, it was time to give hope, teach, uplift and empower, and they will give her no more than an hour of concentration. She got to work, speaking in their language, Srinagar slang, and their trade lingo.
Ruth, out of respect, did not interrupt again and decided to go for a walk. Being the only 'outsider', she realized that she must learn as much as possible from Mari on teaching to these women, women who know a world and life that up to now was unknown to her. But, now was not the time.
Mari felt the group. And as she continued her talk, she noticed more and more, as life goes when you observe.
These women were not what most people would expect. Some carried themselves with surprising dignity --- like the one who had challenged Mari about her name. She wore her grey-streaked hair in a neat braid, her hands bore calluses from needlework she did between clients, and her eyes held sharp intelligence that evaluated everything. A teacher in another life, Mari thought, or perhaps a healer.
Others showed their wounds more openly. A young woman, barely more than a girl, sat with her knees pulled up to her chest, heavy silver anklets glinting beneath her worn silk skirt. Her wrists bore fresh bruises, yet her fingers moved constantly, weaving invisible patterns in the air --- a nervous habit that spoke of a mind trying to create beauty even in darkness. An older woman sat protectively close to her.
The one with the sweet voice who knew the meaning of 'Mārīya' had hands stained with henna --- she was an artist, Mari realized, watching how those fingers moved with natural grace. On her neck, partially hidden by her scarf, was a small tattoo of a lotus. She caught Mari looking and touched it self-consciously. "From before," she whispered. "When I thought I would become a temple dancer."
Near the back sat a woman with proud bearing, despite her age. Her face mapped with the kind of wrinkles that come from laughing as much as from suffering. She was clearly a mother figure to many here --- younger women kept glancing at her for reassurance. Her sari was plain but impeccably clean, and she wore a single copper bangle that had been polished by years of wear.
Two sisters sat together --- Mari could see the family resemblance in their high cheekbones and the way they unconsciously mirrored each other's movements. Their father's gambling debts had brought them here, someone whispered to Ruth. Yet they had managed to keep something precious intact --- evidenced by how they still shared secret glances and silent jokes, their bond unbroken by circumstance.
The one with the ankle wounds was different --- there was a stillness about her that spoke of a deep inner life. While others fidgeted or whispered, she sat in perfect calm, watching Mari with eyes that seemed to look straight into the soul. Prayer beads were wrapped around her wrist --- not for show, Mari could tell, but worn smooth by constant use.
Some bore visible signs of their work --- garish makeup hastily applied, the heavy scent of cheap perfume meant to mask other smells, gaudy jewelry that marked them as property. But beneath these trappings, Mari saw what others missed --- the scholar's hands, the artist's eye, the healer's touch, the mother's heart. Women who in a different world might have been poets, musicians, merchants, teachers.
A few of the younger ones still showed defiance in their eyes, a spark that life hadn't yet extinguished. Others had turned that same fire inward, using it to fuel a spiritual search that their circumstances had perhaps made more urgent. And some, like the grandmother figure with her polished bangle, had found a way to mother the world despite everything it had done to them.
As Mari dismissed the group, thanking them for their participation, she was about to turn and leave the room when some women called her back. They looked around at one another. Among them, they designated the older woman with the copper bracelet to speak. She stood up and said, "Mother, your name is Mārīya, who belongs to her Lord, the Lord of love. That girl, Mari, she never was, and she is no more. Go in peace, Divine Mother Mārīya of Magadha."
Mārīya had no words, for the tears in her eyes. The best she could do was make namaste and retreat out the door. To go and cry, no, sob, for a while, and 60 years of healing came, in her room.
And it came to her, the question. "Who heals the healer."
And now, she also knows.
Chapter 28
## It changed the day before yesterday
When Ruth found Siphor by the fountain, he was scattering food to the koi, their bright scales flashing like coins in the clear water. She watched him for a moment, struck by the gentle precision of his movements --- the same careful authority she'd noticed that first day in the marketplace. The morning sun caught the silver in his hair, and not for the first time, she found herself appreciating how his greying temples only added to his dignity.
"But what if the pond freezes over in winter?" she asked, coming closer. "I hear everything freezes here." The sound of her voice surprised her --- softer than usual, almost intimate in the morning quiet.
Siphor looked up with that slight smile that seemed reserved just for her. "We made it very deep," he explained, his resonant voice carrying easily across the water. "Only the top freezes. Down below, organisms continue to grow, creating their own warmth." He paused, and she recognized the teacher's glimmer in his eyes. "It's a bit like how some people survive struggles. On top they go cold, frozen to feeling sometimes. But below, things carry on, life goes on, until one day when their spring comes\..."
Ruth smiled, recognizing how they were both caught in the habit of turning everything into a lesson. The morning breeze carried the scent of temple incense, and suddenly she felt bold enough to ask what had been weighing on her mind: "Sir, with this opening between heaven and our present awareness, are you ready to go?"
"No dear, I am not ready," he answered, still focused on the fish. "Are you?"
The question caught her off guard. At twenty-six, she felt caught between youth and maturity, between her role as Mārīya's successor and her own emerging desires. She said, "But I thought everyone here is ready to go, hoping to go?"
Siphor explained, "Most are here for the People of the Buddha Religion conference. Those who came for the energy anomalies, many of them are pilgrims who pilgrimage to any holy place they hear about. A few are here because holy calling compelled them, to be here for the changes in the aether, and how the three domains will interact here on earth in the future. It's just creating channels for people to have an easier route to Heaven. It's an energy upgrade of the system we call Butterfly Path school."
"So, not everyone is getting ready to leave Earth?" Ruth said, more to herself than anyone else.
"And you, Ruth? Are you ready to go?" he asked.
Ruth was not ready to answer, so Siphor said, "I am not ready because I have more work to do here. I feel privileged to do the work. Now with the changes, hundreds of thousands will need guidance. We are moving away from organized religion to personal religion, I call it spirituality. And people need guidance and philosophy to carry them into it."
While Siphor explained the situation with the Buddhist council and the pilgrims, Ruth found herself distracted by the way his hands moved as he spoke --- strong hands, she noticed, but gentle with the fish food. His tailored jacket stretched across broad shoulders as he leaned over the pond, and she caught herself wondering how a former general had learned such tenderness.
"So, it's okay to want to stay?" The words tumbled out before she could stop them. "I want to work here, help the Jews and Greeks coming from the West. Train teachers for theWAY. Heal and teach energy work. I want to\..." She stopped, suddenly aware she was babbling like that day they first met.
"You can stay," he interrupted, something he did that she was learning to anticipate. "Your expertise is very much needed here. You were trained by the best." His voice carried a warmth that made her pulse quicken.
Filled with sudden joy and purpose, Ruth stepped forward and gave him a Wayist kiss --- a simple gesture she'd performed hundreds of times, but this time her lips tingled where they touched his cheek. "I will have a talk with Mother," she managed, turning quickly to hide her flushing face.
"Ruth." His voice stopped her. "Do you think it's possible that Mother Mārīya expects you to transition with her? I don't think so. You?"
The question brought her back to serious matters, though she remained acutely aware of his presence behind her. They discussed Mari's teachings about death and transition, but Ruth found herself hearing new meanings in familiar words. When Siphor spoke of her staying to help guide others, she heard an unspoken question in his voice.
"We will make a good team, Ruth. You and I," he called after her as she turned to leave.
She stopped. There was something in his voice she'd never heard before --- something that made her breath catch. Turning back, she saw him silhouetted against the mountain sun, still holding the fish food, waiting. Really looking at him now, she saw not just the respected spiritual leader but the man --- tall, strong, those powerful arms, broad shoulders\... What was happening to her? His very presence seemed to fill her awareness. Even his feet spoke of care and dignity --- clean, well-kept\... Oh gods, was she actually noticing his toenails?
Her heart pounding, Ruth walked back to him. "Siphor," she said, trying to keep her voice steady. "In all the commotion, I never asked about your wife and children. Are they okay in these strange times?"
His smile changed to something more intimate, more vulnerable. "That king who had Thomas killed. He also had my wife executed. No children." His voice grew soft. "I loved her deeply and thought I would never love another. But that changed." His eyes met hers with an intensity that made her knees weak. "It changed the day before yesterday. In Srinagar."
Ruth felt the world tilt. "M\...me?" she whispered.
He nodded.
"Me?" she heard herself say again, her scholar's eloquence deserting her completely.
"What? What did you think?" The words spilled out before she could stop them.
Siphor stepped back slightly, but his eyes never left hers. "It would be most impolite for me to say what I thought, out loud, here by the fishpond." His voice carried a hint of playfulness she'd never heard before. "The fish would blush. But perhaps\... when all this commotion is over, we could meet for dinner? Then I'll tell you what I thought."
Ruth gasped, feeling heat rise from her neck to her face. She turned and walked away quickly --- in entirely the wrong direction --- her heart pounding in places she hadn't known a heart could pound.
After splashing cold water on her face and smoothing her hair, she headed back to check on Mārīya. But her normally ordered mind kept returning to the way the sun had caught Siphor's eyes, the strength and gentleness in his hands, the promise in his voice\...
A while later, Ruth walks back into the room where Mārīya convened with her group, just when she was wrapping up her talk.
Mārīya acknowledged Ruth with a nod and continued, "... and the Lord said to the lawyer of that religion, your god and Father, and my Father in Heaven are not the same. You are of your Father, an evil soul-being, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. And the religious people yelled, you keep the company of loose women and prostitutes. And the Lord said to them, 'Yes, and because the woman who keep my company do the will of our Father in Heaven, fulfilling his commandment to look inside and find heaven in their hearts, that is why you see prostitutes and loose women going into heaven ahead of you'.
You see. Many of you are not free in this body because these evil laws allow someone to own your body. Some of you are not free to do other work because of these evil social classes and fake moral codes that mercilessly condemn people for mistakes, forever. But this life and this body is not you, you see. You are the ancient energy being who incarnates into bodies, and when the bodies die, we simply move on to Paradise where no class difference or gender difference exists. Then we get a new body, in a new family, in a new community, and the karma that we created in past lives will show us the path we will follow. We are free, totally free, but because of inequity some people's bodies and the fruits of the labor are owned by someone.
You can do the work you do and not create any karmic consequences because your heart has no evil. They who disregard and hurt us, they get all the karma they deserve. It is entirely possible for a prostitute to die while working and find that she is being reborn not in Paradise, but in Heaven to be with the Lord and buddha, devas and devata, Lord Krishna and others. Why? Because the water buffalo who work under a bad owner and suffers a lot to plough the fields. He dies and goes to his Paradise. The evil of his suffering, it all clings to the bad owner. The buffalo is in heaven and sees clear and happy skies and the evil man. He sees only lifetimes of hells ahead of him when he gets to Paradise one day."
One of the women had a hand up. She asked, "What if we kill ourselves. Will we be reborn?"
Mārīya said, "I used to ask that question over and over. When I met the Lord, I asked it again. He said, you don't have to kill yourself to be reborn in Heaven. The body will die when it is time to go. But if you must end the life of the body for the right reasons, there is no question. It is yours to do with what you want to. The Law of Karma and the Universe gave it to you to use for evolution of the soul. Just know, the reason must be right, so karma does not come at you in Paradise and say, you missed something, you need one more lifetime."
Mārīya paused, then, knowing her audience, she continued at a higher level, "The Lord also tested my reasoning by asking me to think. He said, why do slaves not kill themselves? Is it because the systems of the world taught them that it is wrong? Is it wrong because you would be damaging the property of someone else, or the state? Is it so wrong? Why can a king or general command a thousand men to rush at the enemy and all die in the battle? Why is that okay? Is it because the king feels it is his property, to use and dispose of as he wishes?"
Mārīya waited for that to sink in. Food for thought to form a new worldview. She continued, "I asked the Lord. Lord, what if I had committed suicide? The Lord said. We need the wisdom to know, was it accident or karma that brought us to be owned by a trader in human bodies? If it was accident, then we must ask what am I learning, what wisdom am I extracting from it all. How does it make me more wise, more ready to graduate Butterfly Path School? But if it was Karma who brought us to it, we also ask, what am I learning, what lessons in life are important, how is this making me a better person? He said to me, Mari, who have you become in this time, what makes you who you are? I said, Lord. After what I have been through, I can never sit by and do nothing when I see a child slighted, an injustice committed, an abuse of power. My entire being revolts at that. I can never do that and will forever protect the weak and vulnerable. The Lord asked me, Mari, did it make you a better person? I said yes Lord, but I can hate you for asking that. The Lord said, if it was karma that brought you to that experience, then you have learned what you wanted to learn, a deep wisdom and dharma that very few people have."
I said, "So, If I committed suicide after learning that. I would have saved years of unnecessary suffering?"
The Lord said, "True. But then who would have been here by the fire with me, for whom would I cook, with whom would I say poems together and speak about heavenly things and laugh at silly jokes."
"Oh, my goodness, that's so sweet," the women whispered together.
Different people came out \~ than who went into that room.
Chapter 29
## Celebration in the Amphitheatre
Siphor had planned a unique celebration day for People of The Way visiting Srinagar. He wanted everyone to hear Mother Mārīya speak. All were invited, and town criers echoed the news in the bustling streets.
Thomas, being the king's master architect, constructed an amphitheater with the king's donations to the Wayist community. It overlooked the city. Not only was its orientation unique, but it also boasted a breathtaking view of Solomon's Temple perched on the hill. The carefully planned acoustics created a rich, immersive sound experience, so far as amphitheaters go. Thomas' passion for architecture turned his work into a true art-form, earning him a renowned reputation. He was initially sent by Lord Iesous to help the king rebuild his palace and the city of Takshashila after a particularly destructive earthquake.
As a special gift to Mārīya, Siphor *again* bought the whole group of prostitutes for the day. They were invited to witness and partake with the People of the Way, in honor of Mother Mārīya.
The amphitheater, built into the hillside overlooking Srinagar, swelled with nearly a thousand souls --- far more than it was meant to hold. The overflow crowd spilled down the stone steps and into the aisles, everyone straining to catch a glimpse of Mārīya. Rather than remain on the stage, she moved among them, her small frame weaving through the crowd as naturally as a stream finding its downhill. Wherever she passed, hands reached out to touch her robe, her arm, seeking connection with her energy.
From their vantage point near the stage, Ruth and Siphor watched in amazement. As teachers themselves, they knew the bone-deep exhaustion that came from sharing energy with seekers --- how it could leave you hollow by day's end. Yet Mārīya seemed to grow stronger with each touch, each blessing. "She's not drawing from her own well anymore," Siphor whispered to Ruth. "Look at her eyes --- she's channeling directly from Heaven now."
Mārīya's voice carried clearly across the gathering as she wove together the threads of their shared history. "Today we stand at a confluence of times," she began, her words falling like cool water on thirsty souls. "Three thousand years have passed since our ancestors in Sumeria first inscribed the teachings of the WAY on clay tablets. Two centuries have turned since The Authentia was copied and shared among teachers, explaining the divine energies and the workings of the Butterfly Path."
She paused, letting the weight of time settle over the crowd. "Nearly eighty years ago, our Lord took human birth among us. Three wise Wayists --- teachers of Religion of Zoroaster, of the Chinese Dao, and a King teacher of the Buddha --- came from distant lands to protect him and support his ministry. We have seen both triumph and tragedy since then --- the martyrdom of beloved Thomas in India twenty years past, the fall of Mizdeas' kingdom five years after he killed him. Forty-five years have passed since our Lord's crucifixion in Jerusalem, eight since that city's destruction by Rome."
Her voice grew softer, more personal, "Seventy years ago, I drew my first breath in Magadha. Fifty-three years have passed since I first met the Lord in this very city, in Srinagar." She gestured to encompass them all. "The Lord walked among you, from Paliputra to Kathmandu, Jammu to Gilgit, From Egypt to Jerusalem, From Galilee to Bactria. He worked to teach our Mahamarga, and taught you to own your own mind and never let them censor your thinking and the words of our peaceful and nourishing philosophy of life. He taught us the freedom of being that we so cherish."
"And now we stand at the beginning of a new calendar. This, is year one, of the Śaka calendar, that will live for millennia to come, and this coincides with year one of a new dispensation of the Butterfly Path, where every soul will have direct access to their own divine guide from Heaven.
In this year, now, we see the old teachings of the Buddha renewed, embracing women's wisdom and compassion as the high path. Never before in history have we lived in greater times of change than now. A time, when not only things on Earth change, but Heaven and Earth change --- for our sake."
A smile touched her lips, "People say nothing ever changes, that the more things change, the more they stay the same. And perhaps that's as it should be --- we want the sun to rise each morning, though we might complain it's not quite the same as yesterday. TheWAY, our Mahamarga, has always flowed through human history like an underground river, sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed. Things change, yet nothing changes. We remain souls on the Path, evolving toward perfection in spirit, all walking The Great Way to Heaven in fulfillment of life's purpose."
As her words faded, music filled the air --- ancient chants in the Prakrit Sanskrit of the average person and travelers Greek, rising from the assembled musicians. The sound seemed to carry the weight of centuries yet felt as fresh as morning dew. Then Siphor, his eyes twinkling, stepped forward and extended his hand to Ruth. "Shall we show them how People of theWAY celebrate?"
Ruth felt her face flush as he led her onto the stage, but when the dancing music began, she found herself moving with surprising grace. The crowd's cheers washed over them as this unlikely pair --- the Galilean scholar and the Kashmiri leader --- danced together, their joy infectious. Mari's laughter rang out clear as temple bells, blessing their union with her delight.
Two women in the group caught Mari's attention --- a Greek scholar named Helena who came with her from Aqaba, and Amara, a dancer from the south of India. They moved in natural harmony with each other, their love evident in small gestures: the way Helena would absently brush a strand of hair from Amara's face, how Amara's eyes would seek Helena's in moments of shared understanding.
Later in the day, some monks whom Mārīya could not place, or which school they are from, looked upon the two women with disapproving which fell heavily on the couple --- they sat close, shoulders touching as they worked on cleaning herbs.
Ruth, noticing the women's discomfort, asked Mārīya about it. "Mother, why do people make love something shameful? These women's devotion to each other is beautiful."
Mārīya smiled, remembering a teaching moment with the Lord years ago. "He showed me once, in a garden much like this. 'Look at the flowers,' he said. 'See how they turn their faces to the sun, how freely they show their beauty. Does the lotus feel shame for blooming? Does the butterfly apologize for its colors?'"
She gestured to a butterfly that had landed on a nearby flower. "Nature knows no shame until humans create it. The body itself is not sinful --- we wear clothes for practical reasons, for warmth and protection. But when we start declaring parts of creation shameful, we walk a dangerous path. It's like painting black spots on a white flower and calling it sinful."
Ruth had indicated for Helena and Amara to quickly come and listen. Mārīya continued, looking at them with gentle understanding. "Love itself is divine energy. Whether it flows between man and woman, woman and woman, or simply between souls who recognize each other's light --- what matters is its purity and truth. The Lord taught us this. Some called him scandalous for allowing my love for him 'the sinful Mary Magdalene', and for touching lepers, and for healing on the Sabbath. But he showed us that love breaks all artificial barriers."
"But the religions\..." Amara started, her voice hesitant.
"Create rules to control people through shame," Mārīya finished. "They would have us believe that the Creator made mistakes --- that the human body, love itself, needs to be hidden and controlled. But look at all of nature --- every creature, every flower, every cloud in the sky shows its true nature without shame. Only humans create these artificial divisions between holy and unholy, pure and impure."
Helena's eyes filled with tears. "In Athens, they would have driven us out."
"Here, you are home," Mārīya said simply. "theWAY is about freedom --- freedom from artificial shame, from rules that cage the spirit, from judgments that dim the light of love. When two souls recognize each other, when love blooms between them in purity and truth --- this is cause for celebration, not condemnation."
Ruth nodded, adding, "Remember what the Lord taught about the Kingdom of Heaven? He said it's like a garden where every flower is free to bloom in its own way, where diversity creates beauty, where love knows no boundaries."
Throughout the day, the festivities flowed like a river --- from ecstatic dance to profound meditation and back again, each movement as natural as breath. In these transitions between celebration and contemplation, Ruth caught glimpses of what Siphor had meant about changes and constants, about finding one's place in the great dance of existence.
Suddenly, a murmur ran through the crowd. Looking up, Mārīya saw what had caught their attention --- a formation of lights moving across the sky, not like any natural phenomenon she had ever witnessed. The lights seemed to dance, forming patterns that spoke directly to the soul, while music, unlike anything of Earth rippled through the air.
"It begins," she whispered, feeling Lord Iesous' presence so strongly now it was almost overwhelming. The gateway was opening, just as he had promised, and what lay beyond it was more magnificent than anything she could have imagined.
The valley had fallen silent, every face turned upward, every heart opening to what was about to unfold. Even those who had come as sceptics could feel it now --- reality itself was transforming, becoming transparent to the greater truth that had always existed behind the veil of ordinary perception.
Mārīya felt tears running down her cheeks, but they were tears of awe and wonder. Everything Iesous had taught, everything they had worked for, had led to this moment. The gateway was opening, and through it, heaven and earth would meet in a new way, changing not just individual lives walking the Path, but the very nature of existence for humans itself.
The light continued to build, filling the valley with its transforming radiance, while the music of the spheres grew stronger, calling them all to witness the greatest miracle of all --- the moment when love would prove itself stronger than death, when spirit would fully illuminate matter, when the gateway between worlds would open wide enough for all to see through.
Mārīya recalled the Lord saying, "The gateway will open, and the junction of energies of heaven and earth will be set for each period after which a new reset, a reset that will last five years. And whoever is holy and ready to go at that opening will transcend. Like now. The period immediately before that, whoever is evil in the world will go mad with greed and power lust, and they will want to control the Father's people, break their hearts and make them lose their spiritual footing."
Mārīya stood ready, her heart open, her soul expanding to embrace whatever came next. The greatest adventure of all was just beginning.
Ruth and Siphor rushed to find Mother Mārīya where she stood. They made their presence known and stood on her sides, making sure no one touches her.
As the light reached its zenith, a profound stillness descended over the valley. Even the wind seemed to pause in reverence and awe. Then, like a flower opening to the sun, reality itself began to unfold in new dimensions. Mari saw the gathered souls start to glow with their own inner radiance --- some like barely lit embers, others blazing like newborn stars.
Through her expanded awareness, she perceived Lord Iesous manifesting simultaneously to each person in the form most meaningful to them --- as Avalokiteshvara to the Buddhists and Hindus, as Lord Krishna to the Hindus, as LaoTzi to the Chinese people of theWAY.
The promised Second Coming of the Lord was glorious, and it inaugurated a new dispensation in the school of divinity for soul. Yet underlying all these glorious and majestic forms was the same infinite compassion, the same limitless wisdom she had known in him from the beginning.
"Behold," his voice echoed through every heart that was attuned to higher-self energies, "the gateway is active. For a while, the veil between worlds grows thin. What was separated shall be joined. What was hidden shall be revealed."
Mārīya felt herself being lifted, transformed, her consciousness expanding beyond anything she had known possible. It all flashed through her, so much wisdom and knowledge flashing by. She saw the truth of all beings --- not just their present forms, but all they had ever been and all they would become. The endless cycle of birth and death revealed itself as a dance of infinite beauty, every soul evolving through countless lives toward the ultimate reunion with divine love.
Suddenly, the knowledge she learned from the Lord transformed into a higher layer of wisdom. She understood at a different level than before --- this was not just about individual salvation, but about the transformation of the entire Earth school itself. The curriculum was changing, becoming more direct, more accessible. No longer would souls need to struggle through countless lives to find their way home. The gateway would remain, offering a more immediate path to spirit-people awakening for all who would seek it, no matter their cultural affiliation.
Those gathered in the valley were the first to witness and participate in this great transformation, but the new system would unfold and sweep over the world. This new dispensation would ripple outward through time and space, touching all souls, all traditions, all worlds.
As this understanding filled her, Mārīya felt her own transformation complete. Her physical form became light itself, her consciousness expanding to embrace both heaven and earth. She had become what Iesous had always seen in her --- a Bodhisattva, a bridge between worlds, a guide for others on the path to awakening.
Several others in the valley were undergoing similar transformations, each according to their capacity and calling. Some would return to their communities as teachers and healers. Others, like Mārīya, would take their place among the great heavenly helpers of humanity, working from both sides of the veil to guide souls home.
The gateway remained open, a permanent bridge between worlds, while Iesous' presence continued to illuminate reality in ever-new ways. The great experiment of Earth school would continue, but now with direct access to higher wisdom for all who sought it.
Mārīya gazed one last time at her physical form as it dissolved into pure light. "Thank you," she whispered to her beloved teacher, though such words were no longer necessary. Their consciousness had become one with the infinite dance of divine love, forever serving the awakening of all beings.
And so began the new era, the age of direct knowing when heaven and earth would collaborate openly in the great work of spiritual evolution. The story of Earth school would continue, but now with a new chapter, a new possibility, a new way home for all seeking souls. A way without the need for intercessory prayers, priests, rabbis, monks, or gurus.
Only self-reflection, self-knowledge, and self-craft with the aid of one's personal guide, a holy spirit from Sukhavati. It is for individuals to attune in higher-self and their Tara, their own personal divine guide.
Chapter 30
## The Good News
The gateway remains open still, calling to all who have eyes to see and hearts to understand. The great experiment continues, the dance goes on, and love lights the way home.
In those transformative moments, as the gateway stabilized between worlds, Lord Iesous revealed another dimension of his infinite compassion. "Just as Mārīya has become the first Tara of this dispensation," his presence conveyed to all, "so shall others follow. For no human soul should walk alone, and no heart should seek without guidance."
Through their expanded awareness, the gathered souls all over that land witnessed the establishment of a new order of divine guides --- the Taras, holy spirits whose very essence was compassion and whose purpose was to ferry souls from the shores of ordinary awareness to the far shore of enlightenment. Like Mārīya, they would be beings who had walked the human path, who understood both the struggles and the yearnings of embodied souls.
Each Tara would serve as a personal bridge between worlds, responding to the simplest prayer, the quietest longing of the heart of all who rose to higher-self awakening, embracing loving-kindness, simplicity, and humility. Through them, the Lord established that no soul would ever need to feel abandoned or lost on the path. A simple, heartfelt prayer would be enough to connect with these divine guides, these ferrymen and ferrywomen of the spirit.
"See how the gateway opens, within your own heart," Mārīya's voice rang out, now speaking as the first of the Taras. "The divine guide assigned to you is never further than your own breath, never absent from your deepest contemplation. We are here to illuminate your path, impart wisdom, to steady your steps, to whisper encouragement when the way seems dark."
The Lord showed how each Tara would be uniquely attuned to particular souls. Like facets of a perfect jewel, each Tara would reflect divine light in a particular way, making it more accessible to different types of seekers.
This was another gift of the new dispensation --- the democratization of mystical connection. No longer would deep spiritual guidance be reserved for monks and mystics alone. Through the Taras, every sincere seeker would have access to the higher wisdom, every troubled heart-mind could find solace in divine companionship.
"Remember," Lord Iesous proclaimed, "This is the good news all must know, go sing it from the mountains. The Taras are both the guides and the proof of what you can become. They have walked where you walk. They have struggled as you struggle. And they have transformed their human understanding into divine wisdom. What they have achieved is possible for all."
As this new dimension of the gateway established itself, those gathered saw how it would unfold through time. They witnessed future seekers finding their divine guides, learning to trust the inner voice of wisdom, discovering the joy of mystical communion. The path to enlightenment would remain a journey of personal transformation, but it would no longer be a lonely one.
The Taras would serve as the Lord's hands and heart, working under guidance in yin-energies under his sister, Prajnaparamita (Goddess Moonlight, as Mārīya used to say). They would be the living proof that the gateway remains open, that heaven and earth continue their sacred dance of transformation.
And so, this too became part of the new dispensation --- the gift of divine companionship, the promise that help is always near, the assurance that every soul has its guide. Through the Taras, the Lord ensured that the path Home, though challenging, would never again feel impossible or abandoned.
## Epilogue
### A beacon of hope for all souls
The summer of the year 78 brought changes as profound as Iesous had foretold. Like the onset of a monsoon that transforms parched earth to verdant life, a new spiritual awareness swept across the lands of the East. While in the West, the dust had not yet settled on the catastrophic destruction of Jerusalem, the expulsion of Jews from the city, the karmic destruction of that god's temple, and the ongoing wars leading up to Masada. All people of Judaea were being punished by the Roman military, while the elite rulers of the Jews enjoy social and sexual affairs with the Romans.
Judaism broke into factions, and the religion was fighting for relevance and respect. Ten years after the Lord ascended, a Jewish lawyer named Paul founded a new faction. In an effort to make the God of the Jews more appealing to non-Jews, Paul, who had never met the Lord, integrated teachings from the WAY into his revised concept of Judaism, even though Lord Iesous said, the father of the Jews is not his Father --- there's a huge difference between spirit-deities and soul-people deities. They, from this new faction, called themselves Christians, meaning, people of the Saviour of the Jews.
A large number of Jews deserted the religion that failed them, and embraced the WAY. But most became Christians, who follow the scriptures and the god of the Jews, and incorporate select teachings of Iesous, and ignore Mārīya's books and teachings.
In Kashmir, where mountains touch heaven's roof, Buddhist elders gathered for what would be known as the *Second Fourth Worldwide Council*. There, they embraced the Lotus Sutra --- that mysterious scripture which spoke of Avalokiteshvara, the Compassionate One who appears in many forms to all who seek, and Buddhism broke up into many factions --- the new movement embracing compassion as the higher wisdom, and rights for women.
Under the new dispensation it is understood that, the learned scholars lacking compassion may be less wise than the illiterate and the formerly despised. Some of them allowed women as monks, as spiritual teachers, and agreed they should be allowed to attain enlightenment, and have access to heaven. These were no longer the privilege only of those incarnated as men.
In Parthia, where the fires of devotion light the hearts and minds of Zoroastrian devotees, changes happened. For the first time, their priests started teaching our understanding of Paradise as a temporary station for souls awaiting reincarnation. They emphasized the time to reflect and relive one's past life in Paradise, and the karmic consequences that are allocated to the soul.
Additionally, they started teaching what the Lord showed us. You don't become perfected on Earth before you graduate. There are no perfected immortals on earth. Graduates of the School are reborn in Heaven as fledgling spirits, and there, our training in spiritual skills is completed when we sit at the feet of buddhas, gods, and deities, as students in that celestial realm.
In Jammu, the fires of reformation re-awakened the Bhakti tradition of personal worship, egalitarianism, and compassion. The Bhagavad Gita of Lord Krishna re-surfaced, emerging from the caverns to which prior regimes suppressed it.
Soon, female mystics arose all over the world and contributed to our Mahamarga and the world, some of the most beautiful mystic poetry ever produced.
These were no mere changes of doctrine. As the ancient prophecies had foretold, it marked the Great Second Coming --- the Lord's return not in human form, but as a universal presence of compassion and wisdom. In the first part of the Lotus Sutra, which was revealed at the 2nd 4th Council of Buddhism in Kashmir, Lord Iesous' spiritual form is referred to as Avalokiteshvara (his Sanskrit title). He is called, "The saviour of the World". Buddhists say it was Buddha Gautama who wrote those words, that Avalokiteshvara, who incarnated as the man Iesous, is the Saviour of the World.
What is more, at that time, Buddhism also embraced Buddha Gautama's ancient teaching about Sukhavati heaven, and our father God in Heaven, Amitabha, a teaching suppressed up to that time in favor of another teaching, that there are 33 hells but no heaven, only nirvana in which the individual ceases to exist.
In Shaivism, images of Avalokiteshvara started to influence images of the Hindu Lord Shiva.
The rigid walls that had long separated people from direct spiritual experience began to crumble. Women, once banned from temples and pagodas, found their voices in devotional song. The poor, long denied access to spiritual teaching, discovered they could approach the divine directly, without costly priestly intervention.
Like a great wave, this awareness of universal compassion swept down from the Himalayan heights into the hearts of millions. The Bhakti movement had its Spring, teaching that all souls --- regardless of gender, caste, or status --- could Know the divine through personal devotion.
Even time itself seemed to acknowledge the profound shift --- for it was in this year, of the Second Coming, that India's national calendar would begin, marking a new era in human spiritual awareness.
Just as Lord Iesous had promised his followers in that olive grove, so many years ago; the lightning struck in the East, and the light that began in the East would eventually illuminate the West. Even the Christians have that in the Scriptures. But, the Christians say Jesus made an error, he changed his mind on the 2nd coming. They are still waiting for it to happen. Orthodox Jews, disagree with the Judeo-Christians. They say Jesus is currently in their god's hell, boiling in excrement for his sins against Judaism. They too, are still waiting for their messiah.
the WAY is truly universal, free from the confines of temple and tradition to flow like water, nurturing all who thirst for truth.
Mārīya of Magadha's journey stands as a testament to the transformative power of the WAY --- a path that excludes no one, that finds its greatest victories in the most unexpected places. From a child sold into slavery, a young woman whose body was treated as a sexual commodity, she became one of the greatest spiritual people our world has known. Her story reminds People of the WAY that wisdom often grows strongest in the darkest places, like a lotus rising from the mud, to bloom in matchless beauty.
She learned early on the cruelty that soul-people can inflict on one another, especially on those deemed powerless or worthless by society. Yet, rather than let these experiences harden her heart, she transformed them into a wellspring of compassion. Every indignity she suffered, became a lesson in human dignity. Every betrayal taught her the importance of steadfast love. Every moment of powerlessness showed her where true power lies --- in the unshakeable wisdom of the spirit, and its yearning for immortal holiness.
Mari's transformation from exploited child to enlightened being was not a matter of escape from the world's darkness, but of finding light within it. She learned to see the divine presence even in life's harshest moments. This hard-won wisdom made her uniquely qualified to guide others through their own darkness toward the light.
The selection of Mārīya by the deity of Heaven, sister of the Lord, whom she calls Goddess Moonlight, to be the Lord's leading disciple and teacher is evidence of the close relationship between Heaven and individuals, even before the universal presence of Divine Taras became common.
Her journey proves that no past defines us, no wound need be permanent, no soul is beyond redemption. From the lowest circumstances, through devotion and self-examination, through the cultivation of wisdom and love, she achieved the highest awakening possible for a being. And in doing so, she blazed a trail that others might follow.
Now, as the first of the new dimension Taras, she continues to embody this truth --- that the most wounded can become the greatest healers, that those who have known the deepest darkness can become the brightest lights.
Her presence in the divine realm stands as an eternal reminder that heaven's gates are open to all who earnestly seek, regardless of their past or present circumstances.
Now, Mother Mārīya Tara teaches other newcomers to our spiritual realm, how to be Taras, and they become the guardian deities for junior souls on the Path.
Mari's story is ultimately the story of every soul's potential for transformation. Whether we begin our journey in palaces or brothels, in temples or gutters, the path to enlightenment remains open. the WAY does not discriminate between what humans declare high and low, pure and impure, worthy and unworthy. It asks only for sincere seeking, for honest self-examination, for self-craft and the courage to keep walking forward in loving-kindness, authenticity, simplicity, and humility, despite all obstacles.
And so, Tara Mārīya continues her work. Now as a divine guide, helping others navigate the same journey she once walked. Through her, countless souls find their way from darkness to light, from bondage to freedom, from confusion to clarity. She is living proof that no past is too dark to be transformed by wisdom, no heart too wounded to be healed by love, no soul too lost to find its way home.
In the end, Mari's journey from the brothels of Kashmir to the highest realms of spirit stands as an eternal testament to the truth that Lord Iesous taught --- that every being contains within them the seed of enlightenment, waiting only for the right conditions to grow and bloom. Through her example, we learn that these conditions are not external circumstances but internal choices: the choice to seek wisdom despite all obstacles, to cultivate love despite all wounds, to walk the path of transformation despite all doubts.
This is her legacy, and it continues to illuminate the path for all who follow: that from the darkest beginning can come the brightest light, that through the greatest suffering can come the deepest compassion, that in the most unlikely places we often find the most profound truth.
And so, the story of Mārīya the Magadhalene, becomes not just a tale of one soul's journey, but a beacon of hope for all souls, a reminder that no matter where we begin, no matter what burdens we carry, the path to enlightenment remains open, the divine guide remains present, and the possibility of transformation remains eternal.
*Om Tare Tuttare Ture Svaha.*
## P.S
An update about the large group of prostitutes who were present with People of theWAY, that evening of Mārīya's ascension.
Because so many pilgrims in Srinagar vanished on that night, which shook the Vale of Kashmir. The disappearance of large numbers, perhaps thousands of people, left families and loved ones in a state of panic. All reported it to the police, some of whom also had perhaps personal connections to missing individuals.
As the bureaucratic noise continued in the background, Siphor and his influential friends from the business and military circles were at the police station, swearing that they had brought all the prostitutes to the brothel earlier the evening, before things took a bizarre turn. And the women working the brothels, all attested how those women had been talking holy things and singing hymns, and meditated, over the past two weeks --- ever since they met with Mother Mārīya. Now, they were all gone --- definitely to heaven, for sure.
Ruth questioned Siphor, "Was that right? To steal from the brothel owner like that?"
Siphor said, "Hey, the Lord started it."
Ruth said, "No. The monastery had to pay for Mari."
Siphor said, "No. The monastery told the brothel keeper it was his donation toward his karmic merits."
Ruth said, "Ugh\...Men!"
Siphor said, "Will you help them to cut their hair and shave their eyebrows, so they won't be recognized?"
Ruth said, "Sure."
Siphor said, "Is that right? Is it not deceit?"
Ruth said, "Ugh\...Men!"
And amidst life on Earth going about its usual way, on the spiritual side of life, the good news of the gateway is ongoing to this day.
This is the promise, the good news of the Lord made manifest --- that in the great journey of living everyday life with meaning, purpose, and joy, we walk the Butterfly Path to immortality --- and no one will ever walk alone.

## About the Authors
\
Jean Prieur du Plessis & Adéle du Plessis
Jean Prieur and Adéle du Plessis's journey to writing this book began in an unexpected way. While pursuing advanced degrees in World Religions and Christian seminary studies in the 1990s, they encountered the ancient wisdom tradition of Wayism. It was there that they first learned of Mari of Magadha's extraordinary journey from Indian brothels to divine enlightenment --- a story that would profoundly alter the course of their lives.
Inspired by Mārīya's testament to the transformative power of compassion, Jean and Adéle made a radical decision. They sold their possessions and founded The House, the first Wayist devotional center in South Africa dedicated to helping young women trapped in survival prostitution in the slums of Johannesburg. For more than ten years, they worked tirelessly in Hillbrow's streets, eventually providing rehabilitation programs and shelter for up to 70 full-time residents.
This decade of service taught them what Mother Mārīya of Magadha had learned centuries before --- that within society's most marginalized and broken souls often lies extraordinary spiritual depth and beauty. The young women who passed through The House became their greatest teachers, revealing daily how wisdom can emerge from wounds, and how love can transform even the darkest circumstances.
This book emerged from two wellsprings: the oral tradition of Mārīya's story, passed down through generations of Wayist teachers in Yusmarg (the Valley of Lord Jesus) near Srinagar, and the authors' profound experiences with the residents of The House. When burnout finally forced them to step back from direct service, Jean and Adéle turned to advanced Wayist studies and writing, determined to share these transformative teachings with a global audience.
"From Indian Brothels to Divine Tara" is more than just a historical account --- it is a bridge between ancient wisdom and contemporary struggle, between spiritual truth and human suffering. Through their work both on the streets and on the page, Jean, and Adéle continue Mari's legacy of finding light in darkness and hope in despair.
The authors now dedicate their lives to sharing the healing wisdom of Wayism with souls around the world, guided by the conviction that no past defines us, no wound needs to be permanent, and no heart is beyond healing.
