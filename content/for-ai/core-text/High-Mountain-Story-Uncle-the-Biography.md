## Foreword
When the Town Council of Nihnuta asked me to write the biography of the celebrated, or dare I say, revered, High Mountain Story Uncle, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with gratitude for being given the opportunity to document the life of such a legendary figure. The stories he shared with us during our childhood were a treasured aspect of our upbringing. It was both thrilling and a privilege to have the opportunity to meet Uncle in person.
I knew it would be challenging. Our whimsical Uncle is, after all, the most enigmatic figure known to the literary world, but I did not initially account for the fact that Nihnuta itself is disturbingly otherworldly. While I expected some of the people, like Uncle, to be eccentric, I was not psychologically prepared to spend time in a place, an entire community, that deliberately teeters on the very edge of sanity and reality, and whimsically plays hop-scotch over that harrowing edge. A village that exists as a mixed-reality abode of wisdom, of another view of reality, nestled between two Dimension Portals. I just didn't know all of that.
Right from the start, I should have suspected that I was unprepared and likely unfit for the task. But I was so eager, and star-struck of course, my normal pessimist-introvert guard was pierced. Negotiating my fee with the Town Council of Nihnuta was where my first view of the other side of sanity started. Their bargaining tactics left little room for compromise. In the end, I received four Canada Goose eggs and a bottle of forget-me-not potion as payment.
The Council insisted on a non-disclosure agreement, allowing me to write only what they permitted. What I misunderstood at first was that the forget-me-not potion, part of my remuneration package, was the non-disclosure mechanism. I had to drink it before and after, and "sometimes" while there. This was for the stated purpose, "...so only the allowed information will be in your memory".
Additionally, the Town Council of Nihnuta picked the time of my arrival; something to do with the moon cycle. I was to check myself in at an inn on the outskirts of a certain town, the name of which now does not exist in my brain. And they would provide "ass transport" to Ninhuta. I had to clarify that. Turns out, it means transport by donkey, which was a relief to hear.
Nihnuta offered me a unique perspective on village life, where I could observe and listen to the captivating tales of High Mountain Story Uncle, and move about with him through his everyday workings. This biography captures the stories related to me by the aunties, animals, and uncles in Nihnuta, as well as the vivid scenes I witnessed.
In compliance with directives from the Town Council, I shall end this introduction with: This important literary contribution would not have been possible without the support and contribution of the esteemed Town Council of Nihnuta.
Chapter 1
## Nihnuta
High Mountain Story Uncle, the multiple award-winning and now world-famous author of spiritual entertainment stories, resides in the enigmatic village of Nihnuta.
Despite the best efforts of the Chinese Q.K.D, and Google satellites, the village's location remains a closely guarded secret to hide it from humans.
According to the ghost of Genghis Khan, who challenges Uncle to nightly Brazilian ghost jujitsu battles, High Mountain Story Uncle, is a sprightly hundred and thirty-seven years old, though he doesn't look a day over 70. We know this only because WHO Hu told us.
According to WHO Hu, the village pharmacists medical expert owl from China, he has close contact with the ghost of Genghis Khan, who is still under Karmic quarantine in areas of hardship quagmire.
Others say, Uncle's youthful appearance is attributed to his daily practice of Karman Active Meditation, wrestling matches with Big Menis the goat, and battles with the giant Delicious Monster plants that turned nasty from a virus that escaped a gain of function lab thousands of miles upwind from Nihnuta.
However, Uncle says the true secret to his vitality lies in the Amrit, that spiritual elixir we consume during our encounters with spiritual beings. He says, "Amrita transforms us from within, granting wisdom and dynamic youth. That's why when people look at photos of me, they say you always look different."
Uncle's eccentric fashion sense is as legendary as his stories. His snowy beard cascades down his chest, sometimes in neat plaits adorned with tiny rainbow bows (but only when the aunties had their way with him, pinning him down for a grooming session). His thick eyebrows often resemble the aftermath of a wild boar brawl in the forest. According to the aunties of Nihnuta, who sometimes stay up to watch him swim late at night, Uncle must cleanse himself in the river after each nightmare ghost-jujitsu session, as Genghis Khan's ghost lathers his body in lard before a tussle. "It must be that lard, why his old skin still feels youthful," they say.
Nihnuta pueblo cuddle at the feet of High Mountain, in Pinkytoes River Valley. All living beings, children, animals, and plants are required to be authentic, and all are considered voting members of society. I had to rapidly adapt to extremes like, respectful children out and about all day and late evening, chivalrous men, beneficent women, animals with conciousness, thinking and singing plants, and wondrous wielders of joyous life force and intelligence everywhere. More than a culture shock, it was an aura and chakra shock.
The village is fiercely protected from the interference of Disney, the CIA, FBI, EPA, FDA, CNN, BBC, CBC, all alphabet people in fact, and tourists who lack the imagination, respect, and love in their hearts to appreciate Reality as it is.
In 2010, Nihnuta received its first telephone when a twice-in-a-lifetime tornado picked-up a busload of politicians, scientists, and academics from a COP conference in Cancun, Mexico, and dumped them upriver from the village. The aunties took quick action. While the swept-in delegates were still wet and emotionally triggered, the aunties dressed as nuns and nurses with short skirts, and promptly put them all on intravenous therapy with Whaat-the-fook!, the potent Nihnuta rum which filled them with visions of rainbow-colored socks doing the can-can across fields of buttered toast.
After selling the babbling, deluded, self-styled "elite" down the river, Uncle dusted off the irritating ringing device they left behind, only to find it utterly useless. The Council made a motion that the village tried the phone thing, and declared they have no need for it. The solar charger that came with it is currently being used to power a little red light on the top of the ancient temple ruin's tower, preventing pelicans from flying into it at night. The abusive language that follows those accidents is not good for the children of the village to hear so late at night because they repeat it, acting as if they don't know what it means, with the excuse of, "Its just bloody mother f#@ Pelican talk, mom, we're being inclusive".
Most of Nihnuta's streets are paved. Except for the steam-engine Big Hauler, no motorized vehicles go about in the village. The cobblestone roads have been there since before Alexander got his butt (and rumor says other unspeakable things) kicked by Amazonian women in the Himalaya Mountains.
Because of the steep valley, the authorities have installed "speed bumps" on the streets to slow down water torrents in the rainy season and runaway wheelchairs The only way for a donkey cart to descend is in reverse, and not all the asses in Nihnuta do reverse.
Uncle's days are filled with an array of what we would consider being whimsical activities. For breakfast, he catches rainbow trout through a hole in his kitchen floor, trades eggs from his pet chickens who roost in the un-cold lower section of his old fridge (the fridge doesn't have a cold section, there's no electricity, but Uncle uses the freezer section for clean socks), and wrestles with Menis, the rambunctious goat who guards his front door which is in Auntie Jamaina's goat pen ever since the other, twice in-a-lifetime tornado deposited Uncle's house in that spot.
Menis, with his shaggy fringe hanging over his eyes, and recurring pink eye from sticking his nose in places impolite, takes his guard duties seriously, refusing to let human males pass without a vigorous headbutting match. For Menis there are only two genders, those who are deserving of a headbutt match and those you don't care to headbutt.
Not everyone is on board with the teaching about the origin of Pinkytoes River, which forms the steep valley. Throughout history, every time the birds are sent on a (paid) mission to find and report about the origin of the river, the report comes back with the same 120-page result. "The river's origin is the oceans. The sun heats up the water and the wind brings the clouds and the rain on the mountain peak creates the river, which takes the water to the ocean where the sun heats up the water and the wind brings the clouds and the rain on the mountain peak creates the river, which takes the water to the ocean where the sun heats up the water and the wind brings the clouds and the rain on the mountain peak creates the river, which takes the water to the ocean where the sun... \I redacted the rest, to save the readers\." The reports I have seen all end with, "We think it's very human but incorrect to say you cannot step into the same river twice."
Although more than ninety percent of the population of Nihnuta, and that includes all soul beings, live by the principles of theWAY, Auntie Jamaina started a religion. She believes all people need religion, especially male humans. She is also the self-appointed religious leader of Nihnuta Village, and founder of the Budslam religion. Jamaina and Budslam both are insufferable judgmental and self-righteous forces tolerable only with copious helpings of Whaat-the-fook!. She is a statuesque woman with broad shoulders, men's working boots, and once-white rugby socks. Unlike her ego, Jamaina's sense of beauty in attire and coiffure never bloomed.
Auntie Khadisha from the local cobbler volunteered that rumours (the chili peppers of spices) go around that Jamaina is of undetermined sex. She says most people agree she detests men and men reciprocally detest her, so whether or not she had sex is easily said to be undertermined. I did ask whether she means gender, it's the common way of speaking nowadays. She said, "No. Here in Nihnuta we like sex."
Villagers squirm at Jamaina's "unfortunate voice" but evidently she considers it a great asset, for she uses it often, and loudly. For the Budslam, nice things and nice feelings are sinful, and therefore taxable. Not only must masturbation, good vibes, and looking at an attractive person be confessed at the sin-tax booth, but also that "demonic" feeling that you have enough and are content with it. Many other things are very sinful and are taxed accordingly. Except for carrots and cucumbers, they're not sin-taxed, they are outright banned in Budslam households because of the lascivious nature of those two vegetables. Occasionally, Budslam zealots petition Council to ban those vegetables from the entire valley, and farmers are called vulgar names for cultivating it.
Most people just roll their eyes and don't answer when the Budslam goes door to door on Saturdays and pray oddly in the streets.
At Uncle's dilapidated river-slide cottage, there is always a lively atmosphere, as aunties from the neighboring villages pass by bringing delicious homemade treats and filling the air with laughter and merriment.
When male folk remind him they are available, should he need a hand to fix something in the cottage, Uncle always replies, "We will have to talk to the house about that. She's not complaining. Looking good." I noticed he doesn't even realize someone cleans the place when he is not there.
The cottage used to be riverside, now it is river-slide, says Uncle. That happened since the great flood of Pequeño Huracán, when it rained more, instead of less, as the World Climate Emergency Organization, called XOAH (a word of Mayan origin) had predicted --- you know, that time when the world would end because of severe droughts.
The unfortunate cottage is now sliding into the river. It tilts at a 230^0^ angle and drapes itself over the river quite a bit.
Every morning before breakfast, Uncle goes out to buy a quart of fresh milk from farmer Jim's Udderly Delicious Milk & Buttery & Cafe-Latte, just down the road.
Ever since moving to Canada more than 20 years ago, I haven't tasted real milk. My body just could not get enough of that wholesomeness, and real butter, and real cheese. I tried to explain to Jim what milk is like in Canada, how we process it and how we get sick because of it. Jim shook his head and laughed his deep belly laugh, made that head-exploding gesture and the finger at the temple churning gesture, "You writers are all the same. The crazy shit yous people think will kill y'all one day. Here, have a latte and do better."
Uncle introduced me to his favourite delicatessen. He treats himself, evermore with a twinkle in his eyes, on an occasional trip to Kate & Hoppins Impolite Tarts. Always, he picks up his favorites, a large wedge of Kate's Sassy Savoury Tart and two of Hoppins' Sweetest Small Melons cakes each with a squirt of tangy pensadoras libres sauce.
Kate & Hoppins Impolite Tarts, is famous for its Authentic Brownies. Eat one whole brownie and you cannot but be authentic, and the effect can last like a week or so, is what they tell me. Kate does not sell her brownies, she dispenses them with medical care --- not like allopathic doctors who are reps for chemical companies but with care. For example, she refuses to sell them to Uncle. He laughs about it, "She says if I be one octave more authentic, it will draw unwanted attention to Nihnuta."
Kate says, already the FBI is grooming Aunty Patel to help them get rid of Uncle with her pestilential slipper, which she can wield over an extraordinary long distance with an impeccable aim at one's head. While Uncle's authenticity may be too intense for most people, it reaches new heights when he starts making suggestions on how she should adjust her maniputtu recipe --- one bite of Kate's brownies and the aunty may well snap and do the hit for the FBI.
I said, but authentic does not mean one may be impolite. Kate said it's not like that. Auntie Patel's maniputtu tastes like many putta washed in it, it's not supposed to be a fish dish. I made a note to research that reference, I don't get it.
It's Nihnuta ... I don't get it. I like Kate. I think her authenticity is ambrosial. Ambrosial ... Its Nihnuta ... can't trust my mind. Life is not *that* profound. My mind never was a grandiloquent histrionic poem. Thoughts shan't all be mawkish. Devoting every day to delving into the significance of the words my thoughts produce is both senseless and a sign of subpar writing. Snapping out of the delicious maelstrom had become my daily survival.
I have also learned to not speak to Uncle when he returns from Kate & Hoppins until he was done eating. He indulges slowly, dreamily, and his aura glows in appreciation of foods. Intense and emotional mindfulness. Once, sitting with a beaker of Jim's latte and his treats from Kate & , he shushed me, saying, "Kate and I are having a moment here. Now, lets not talk."
I tried the Sassy Savoury because I am a fan, but salty tart before breakfast is too early for me to appreciate.
The village is a hive of commercial activity as most households have something to sell and trade, skills, services, and food. Small businesses and people like these, who do things to support themselves, are not taxed. Therefore, on the other hand, there is no so-called "unemployment problem" and no need for so-called "employment insurance" or welfare. People are resilient and inventive, if given a chance. But, alas, people like that cannot be controlled and their votes cannot be bought. So, no democratic country wants that, they tell me. And that too, is why there is no democracy in Nihnuta, only common sense and peer pressure rules. It is the export trade, however, that creates the monetary wealth. If you ever came across the strangest food ever seen, smelled or tasted on your international travels, chances are it is imported from Nihnuta under license to pack for that country.
Whenever a sewer line needs to be dug up, or laid, or a road repaired, or a bridge be renovated, the Council declares a Fix-it-Week. Weeks ahead of Fix-it-Week, everyone in town plans and prepares for it. The mayor will be the first to start working and if she or he is showing promise at really going at it, the community pitches in, bringing whatever materials they could source. I am told that most streets in Nihnuta were originally planned to be straight, but because of the parties and fun had by all, and Whaat-the-fook! rum, every major construction in the village turns out queer, no matter how straight it looks on the blueprints. Whatever remains unfixed after Fix-it-Week remains unfixed until next time.
Nearly every weekend, Uncle's slanted home overflows with floral nighties and fluffy slippers for one of his crowded uncle-&-auntie pajama dance parties.
These shindigs often draw the ire of sour Auntie Agatha, the one with the 4-hair mole. She sends for Constable Monobrow, Nihnuta's token bylaw officer, to put a stop to the boisterous boogying. But, the dutiful Constable who goes about by bicycle when called, rarely makes it past Big Menis, the guard goat, who guards Uncle's front door with unwavering determination. And if Constable does get through, it is up to the uncles to get him upright and the aunties to ply Constable with Whaat-the-fook! and doctor his wounds.
So, inevitably, Constable stays till late. The tales of his heroism are what Mrs. Constable believe, and every other Sunday she nurses his hangover and scuff marks.
When inspiration strikes, Uncle dons his legendary Writer's H'Mong Bamboo hat, a patchwork mesh of interwoven Vietnamese copper antennae, colorful yarns, rare gemstones, and bits of crushed meteorite for superb energy resonance.
He claims the hat was a gift from Zyvox, a seven-talented alien librarian from the planet Nibiru, during a debate over the superiority of pink over green cream soda. As tensions escalated between the two because they could not agree on the right colour for cream soda, a matter of intergalactic importance by the sounds of it, hot-tempered Zyvox ripped an advanced computing device from his head and angrily frisbee'd it at Uncle.
But the compassionate storyteller managed to smooth things over by agreeing to an interplanetary treaty to license both pink and green cream soda. He also introduced his opponent to the blissful taste of swirled strawberry-lime cream soda. Their tiff put behind them, Zyvox let Uncle keep the thrown techno-hat as an interplanetary symbol of friendship.
But who knows if that wild origin tale holds any truth? With such a whimsically invented past, mystifying present and unseen future, getting facts suitable for the limitations of human brains from High Mountain Story Uncle proved impossible.
The only sure things were, whenever Uncle parked that Wired Writer's H'Mong Bamboo hat atop his braided silver head, out poured the most wondrous worlds infused with otherworldly-hued magics, straight from his boundless imagination and heavenly wisdoms. As his enraptured readers discovered, that hat, and the Jungle AI, and raicilla from either Mascota or from El Tuito, held powers beyond ordinary human comprehension!
Uncle's writing process is a collaborative effort, involving the "Jungle AI," a group of 3,207 Mexican monkeys who read newspapers and books of wisdom daily, as well as various animal, plant, and mycelium people of the jungle, all pitching in ideas and bookmaking help. Anyone who has read one of Uncle's books has seen the hand of well-meaning but not well-trained volunteer editors, typesetters, and proofreaders in it. Auntie Jamaina, heads the moral committee, removing profanities and unflattering references to her before stories are published, while other village aunties assist with final editing, their imperfect English occasionally allowing quirks to pass through.
Not all of Uncle's stories are inspired by his alien hat, but by all who cross into his awareness: the Jungle AI, his divine spiritual guide, and his weekend pajama dance parties with the uncles and aunties, and Nihnuta has many aunties. Most tales feature plant and animal characters, reflecting his philosophy of theWAY, which holds that all lifeforms in nature have a soul and mind, and their interconnectedness comprises the oneness of life on Earth.
The village relies heavily on what they refer to as the food forest for their source of sustenance. Farmers plant all kinds of food bearing trees amidst the jungle trees, berries, and herbs, with veggies in-between.
"Plant enough for the animals and soil to also enjoy their share," Uncle says, "All life is about ecology. Keep the ecological balance. Your personal energy ecology is linked to your community energy ecology, your home, and family energy ecology, and all the forest and animals live to each contribute to that natural ecology. For the sake of all that is holy, keep scientists away from food and nature. They simply do not have enough respect to learn anything useful."
Chapter 2
## Career Highlights
It was my responsibility as the official biographer to prompt Uncle to reflect on the standout achievements in his illustrious career.
He said, "What do you mean, standout. Every day is amazing. We live with gusto and joy, with deep reflection and commitment to get the most out of every moment. Every day has standouts to reflect upon."
I explained that most people highlight when they won an award or competition, and I had heard Uncle has several such international rewards.
He said "Fine then, I guess that is why you are here. I will tell you about only three of my special rewards."
Throughout his illustrious career as a writer, Uncle has won many prestigious awards.
The first international award he won was "Friesland's Most Robust Milk Can Maker" award. This was for Uncle's inadvertent contribution to the Dutch sport of *carbiet schieten*, in which they load a milk can with carbide and explode it. As a competitive sport!
Uncle had arranged to meet his Ghanian brother in Friesland, which, he says, was sort-of halfway between Nihnuta and Ghana at the time.
Friesland also happened to be where one of Uncle's Dutch girlfriends has a milk farm.
Despite never getting into milk can production, Uncle did lend a helping hand to some Dutch individuals and found himself mistakenly acclaimed for his robust, reusable milk cans in the explosive sport of *carbiet schieten*.
What happened, according to Uncle, is that he delivered his girlfriend's milk cans to and address she had given him, but he got it wrong because of there being so many Dutch people speaking Dutch --- they looked at the milk cans and directed him to the event.
And so, Uncle was instrumental in the Friesland Team's record-breaking milk can-lid launches in 1996. The sturdy milk cans he delivered withstood the powerful explosions of ignited carbide packed into the can, propelling the lid of the milk can across the village to land on the soccer field, leaving his competitors in awe. Their cans would blow out the bottom with heavy loads. Anyone who ever had a blown-out bottom from a heavy load knows the pain of lost dignity...
Uncle's girlfriend's cans earned him the prestigious title of Most Resilient Milk Can Maker. But, says Uncle, he didn't enter her cans in the contest, he only delivered the two cans at the incorrect address on that strange day --- then stood by watching as the Dutch people started blowing things up. The entire incident unraveled before Uncle's eyes, but he couldn't make sense of it. It was all about explosions, not only in Frielandic, but also in Dutch. Uncle showed the trophy and official certificate from the *vlecke* of Joure, the last bastion of Dutch resistance against the Friesian Land Reform Movement started by Uncle's girlfriend, who wants to rename all dikes in the country to have male names. Uncle pointed out that the coat of arms of Joure is a milk can exploding top and bottom, so having good quality cans is a big deal for them.
The second international award bestowed upon Uncle is the Kerala State Slapping Kabaddi Champion award. This was for Uncle's unsolicited and impromptu display of the noted Indian martial art of Slapping Kabaddi.
As I had come to expect of Uncle, he won the championship not at the national championship arena, but in an adjacent arena where they held a water buffalo race.
Uncle visited his Indian brother in the southern state of Kerala. His career as a writer became even more thrilling when he emerged as the unexpected disruptor of Kerala's Water Buffalo Race finals.
Shortly after arriving, a bit dehydrated from the tropical heat, his brother took him to the loud rice paddy surrounded by hundreds of deeply impassionate people.
While still trying to understand what the excitement was all about, Uncle noticed two mean water buffaloes running away from their handlers, who were chasing after them with long sticks and loud hollering and the crowd going berserk.
As a true Wayist just trying to be helpful, it was unfortunate that Uncle failed to grasp the fact that the people pursuing the bulls were actively engaged in the racing event, not trying to catch runaway animals.
As he explained to the NDTV reporter on the video, a touch of frustration in his voice, "Whoever could have known? They have all these scribbeldy writings and selling tickets and taking bets and stuff, but nobody can comprehend the puzzling language. And because of the hot peppers they talk so fast, not even their mothers understand them."
Uncle had mistaken the commotion in the rice paddy for bulls on the loose, and young men desperately trying to capture them. Just trying to be helpful, misinterpreting the disorderly occurrence. He hastily rushed on the field and grabbed the nose rings of both charging bulls, and flipped them head over heels, overpowering the massive creatures and forcing them into submission in the mud.
In the grip of overwhelming disappointment, one of the would-be champion athletes administered a slap to Uncle. In response, Uncle promptly delivered a barrage of very impressive stinging slaps in retaliation, causing three muscular athletes to writhe in agony.
The crowd, initially showing their disapproval by booing Uncle, suddenly burst into cheers, and enthusiastically gathered around to lift Uncle onto their shoulders and escort him to the Slapping Kabaddi podium.
After hearing the story, and witnessing the bull-racing athletes getting medical help, all Slapping Kabaddi contestants conceded the first prize, and competed only for 2nd and 3rd prize. Thus, without his comprehension, Uncle's unintentional mastery of the Keralite martial art resulted in him being bestowed the title of Kerala Slapping Kabaddi national champion. Uncle graciously accepted the award, of course, expressing profound gratitude to his sparring partners at home --- the majestic Delicious Monster plants that adorn the mountain path leading from Nihnuta pueblo, the ghost of Genghis Khan, and Aunty's goat, Menis.
The third award we must take note of, because it is on the official biography the Council publishes, is when Uncle received the Nihnuta Village Historical Society's highest literary prize for the book, "Guru Ma'ax," the first 100% Mexican Monkey AI-authored novel, dictated entirely by his Jungle AI troupe.
Guru Ma'ax was dictated solely by Uncle's "Jungle AI Collective". Their experimental masterpiece obliterated the last stronghold of the publishing world, the writers. Uncle accepted the award on behalf of his primate wordsmiths during the acceptance ceremony.
High Mountain Story Uncle's life story is a tapestry woven from the unlikely, the absurd, and the wholly profound. Born from the collective wisdom of the village and the guidance of his Divine Spiritual Guide, his stories serve as vehicles for Wayist truths, encouraging readers to find their highest path and live in harmony with all living beings. As Uncle continues to inspire generations with his tales of talking autumn leaves, enlightened butterflies, and noble chipmunk samurai, and police raccoons, his legacy as a purveyor of joy and light only grows, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of all who encounter his magic.
I mentioned Menis. Despite his clouded vision of eye and life perspective, Menis stubbornly refuses to let the ladies tame or at least wash his wild bangs. The problem started when he was told that Uncle once wrote about his bangs in a story, describing it as, "greasy and execrable from nefarious foraging." Impressed, Menis thought it sounds sophisticated and ever since no-one was allowed to interfere with his look.
When greasy, the fringe obstructs his eyesight, making him prone to charging at anything larger than a chicken --- be it a person or laundry on the line. The only exceptions he makes are for the women in the village. He refuses to hold his rule for transgender women. Jemina says he goes by "the smell of a female" and that, to her, puts to bed the rumour that she herself is of indeterminate gender. Menis seems to instinctively know how to treat women with care and chivalry. Even his own species appreciate him --- a lot.
Bless poor Uncle. Most days for him start painfully because he does Karman Active Meditation before coming out of his room. Painful, not because of the physicality of it, but because his body is bruised from yesterday's battle with Menis. But he holds no grudges against the goat --- in fact, he enjoys keeping his reflexes sharp and proving himself to this judgmental creature! On slower days, Uncle even invites his writer's block over for a lively match with Menis, just to add some excitement to life. Because you never know when inspiration will strike, even in the midst of a goat jiujitsu pretzel lock!
When new male residents move into Nihnuta they are warned about Auntie Jamaina and her moralistic tyranny. With her stout frame and unwavering presence, she "rules over the morals of the village with an iron fist", so she believes. Many have tried to explain to her that going around calling people sinners is not ruling and does not make her a moral authority --- it's all in her mind. People tried to explain that yelling at men about how she knows all the women lust after them is not an insult, and will not deter the man from using cologne. Nevertheless, religious people know another truth.
Her religion, Budslam, is a blend of self-proclaimed righteousness, delusions of superiority, and disdain for men who are by nature smelly, unworthy, and desirous of discipline. The tenet of "Bud" worships Thinking as the ultimate elusive deity, while "Slam" focuses on the undesirability of all males and heathens. She is the "divinely appointed" scribe of holy scripture, claiming it is inspired by his holiness, Mo, a prince from Nigeria who emails her. "His messages come through the air and appears in glowing light on that machine in the library," she explains with awe-shivers of mystical emotion.
Despite her ample size, Auntie Jamaina is surprisingly agile and strong from years of taming goats and wayward men --- well, actually men who try to escape from her "righteousness boot camp". It's understandable why there are fewer males than females seen on the streets of downtown Nihnuta --- either they endure Auntie's approaches or find pleasure in places untouched by the twenty-five religious folk.
I ask Uncle about the reason why they tolerate Budslam in their midst if it is so disrespectful of the harmony and all living beings in Nihnuta. He says, "We tolerate them like we do mosquitoes. It's messy when you slap them and you always hope to one day learn what positive contribution they make in the ecology, so its easier to not want to slap them. Then, you learn to observe them and you realize they torture and punish themselves, you don't have to do it. They are deeply unhappy in the hells they made for themselves. Like mosquitoes, they can only lay their eggs in the blood of others and breed in the swamps of life. I feel sorry for them, but Karma is there to help them come around, you know."
Uncle taught me, like most religious people, the Budslam are no different. They are aware only of a very small part of reality. And it is that small-world view they want to rule over with moral high ground. Morals, they themselves don't keep but use only to judge others. They create in their minds gods in their image, cruel like humans, but stronger.
One of the men on the square who hand out tracts taught me their beliefs, "Anything to do with imagination or metaphysics, which falls outside of true thinking science, does not exist and it is evil... Nonexistent evil, no... existent evil that does not exist. Well, basically... a conspiracy theory is what it is."
It boils down to, therefore, all People of theWAY and animals with souls and minds are nothing more than a conspiracy theory in their view of life. That's why they believe Nihnuta is in danger and the prophet Mo of Nigeria will come to save us after their god annihilates us one day soon. In the meantime, they, the Budslam, are the moral authority and the only righteous beings on the planet and we are here for their use and enjoyment.
I asked about their definition of conspiracy theory. They tell me when the CIA murdered the American president in the 1960s and people talked about it, they and the media invented the term conspiracy theory. Facts do not matter and do not exist, so it's evil and anyone believing it is a lie.
That was a bit much to process. So, to double check my understanding, I ask, "You mean like Covid 19, Climate Change, 9/11, the Moon landing, and that elected officials work for the people?" They confirmed, "Yes, all lies. All things exist, but lie things don't exist, and when it doesn't exist, its evil. All lies exist, but when they don't exist, it's evil. Straight from the Book of Mo."
Good lord! My mind reeling; I needed some of Uncle's raicilla, so took my leave. Never could reason with religious people, could I?
Jamaina is all about strict proof: gender, race, and yes, even prescribed vegetable preferences for Budslam membership. She would have liked to have DNA proof of race for all vegetables and lie detector tests for all who swear they believe her doomsday predictions that the weather will change. Mister Buy Herr's pharmacy has a state-of-the-art DNA lab in a locked suitcase in his basement, and that is her go-to, working through WHO Hu, the owl.
But the DNA of High Mountain Story Uncle, she says, "No one really knows where Uncle comes from, nor what spices muddle his heritage. We don't know if he's even fully male, female, or some kind of transistors alien from an unholy place."
Because his origins seem to be cloaked in as much mystery as his Jungle AI system, High Mountain Story Uncle often seem to get a free pass on Jamaina's carrot crusades and enforced bending sideways breathing contortions exercises.
They explained, according to The Book of Mo's strict rules, that God is watching and will kill me if I don't comply. Men must wash not only their physical shame parts (like their butt and feet) five times a day, but also their minds --- which means bending sideways many times, reciting vegetable prayers and fasting on broccoli over new moons. Failure to be able to light your farts after Broccoli Fast, which is a sign of getting rid of evil, results in quarantine in the Public Shaming cage in the market square --- a cage funded by Auntie herself and built by her devoted followers.
Uncle once asked Jamaina why she believes what the book of Mo says. She said, "It's the Truth". Uncle asked, how do you know it's the truth? She opened the book of Mo to show him, and there it was written, "What is written here is the truth."
"That is circular reasoning," said Uncle.
"Exactly!" she proclaimed, so you better believe it.
Anyways, she decided to excommunicate Uncle High Mountain Storyteller before he would ever dare to apply to be a Budslam. But, as it turns out, she still tries to convert him. There is no end to circular reasoning, and that, exactly, is the appeal of Budslam and the very reason why the proponents believe its Divine inspiration.
As my officially appointed tour guide, Gertrudy, a milk cow who once worked for farmer Jim's but is now freelancing, should be showing me around. But she is more interested in strutting along the malecón in her bikini and snapping selfies with the simcardless mobile which the village confiscated from the drunken international scientists and politicians. She must return it in the evenings, so it's hard to get her to concentrate on anything but. I will write about her later, but now must get shuteye because Uncle says Big Dick the huge black cockerel wakes us up at 05:30 sharp.
Chapter 3
## Life Can Feel Like a Circus of Clowns
As the sun rises over the mystical village of Nihnuta, casting a warm glow on the thatched roofs and lush greenery, High Mountain Story Uncle emerges from his slanting cottage, ready to embark on another day. For him and the village, just another day. From my perspective, though, all his days are filled with wonder and whimsy.
He begins his morning routine by catching a geriatric rainbow trout through the hole in his kitchen floor, using a fishing pole crafted from platted layers of whiskers of retired catfish who swap it for rice balls. Uncle keeps the pole manicured with shellac and gum Arabic which, he says, "the transcontinental Elephants smuggle into Pinkytoes Valley, past the Council's tax police, those crafty darn Raccoons..."
The trout, known for their philological musings, often engage Uncle in deep conversations about books they read, and critique about his books full of grammar mistakes and typos. He, in turn, tells them tales of his travels. They always thank him for putting their old bodies to honorable use as they wave this world adieu for another reincarnation in a new young body in another interesting part of the world --- clinging to the hope their next life will be in a part where people still read books.
After a hearty breakfast of fish and eggs, courtesy of his pet chickens who roost in the old fridge, Uncle steps outside to face his morning challenge: Big Menis, the goat guardian of Auntie Jamaina's pen. The goat, who once made the local newspaper because of his antics, has a shaggy fringe obscuring his vision, and a deeply malodorous beard. Every morning Menis charges at Uncle with unbridled enthusiasm, determined to show his willingness to effect dominance in this corner of Nihnuta. Uncle, however, has honed his goat-wrestling skills over the years and engages Menis in a lively tango of hooves and horns, and jujitsu moves, their dance a testament to the unbreakable bond between man and beast, says Menis, and Menis only.
Outside the garden gate, a group of youngsters on their way to Whimsey School, a block and half away, about as far as Gerard says he can hurl a loogie but no-one ever saw him succeed, congregate and wait for Uncle. They indicate to him to remember his 4-string guitar, the one that used to have six strings, but two have now retired from active duty --- one holds the dream catcher to the lampshade. "The one with the choir of fungi!" holler Caitlin before Uncle entered the cabin. Uncle indicated, "Ah yes, okay, coming."
With Menis thoroughly satisfied, his daily dose of excitement achieved, Uncle can go about the yard without a dual to the death of ego. He brings the 4-string with the cracked box and those tiny mushrooms growing inside. While more townsfolk gather around for the morning sing-song.
Even before Uncle is in position and ready to strum the cracked box with the mycelium choir, they start it off, singing the rhyme.
"5,8,4,1 a cappella al fresco!" announce Caitlin, the girl with the big voice, triangle glasses and multi-coloured braces, taking charge and starting the singing (and I swear, one kid had his hand on his heart):
*"In the mystical village of Nihnuta, where the sun rises with a grin,*\
*High Mountain Story Uncle strums his guitar, and invites the world to join in.*
*He clears his throat, his eyes aglow, he sings a song that all should know."*
This is where Uncle comes in. He strums the strings on the cracked box. There in the background, Big Dick the cockerel races up. Almost late, he has a role to play...
*"In this world of ups and downs, where life can feel like a circus of clowns,*\
*There's a secret that I've found, a way to turn life's frowns upside down.*
*It's the power of wonder and whimsy, you see,*\
*a magic that sets your spirit free."*
(WHO Hu toots the chorus in)
*Wonder and whimsy, joy and awe,*\
*They're the keys to a life that's worth living for.*
*When you embrace them with an open heart,*\
*The hardships of life become a work of art.*
*Gratitude fills your soul, and purpose takes flight,*\
*Wonder and whimsy, they make everything right.*
*Some folks get caught in the trap of discontent,*\
*Struggling and competing, their energy spent.*
*They toil in monotony, day after day,*\
*Forgetting that life's meant to be a play.*
*But those who choose the path of the authentic and true,*\
*Know that wonder and whimsy are the way to push through.*
*They find joy in the simple things, like a butterfly's wing,*\
*And in the face of adversity, they dance and they sing.*
(Gerard flicks WHO Hu's ear, he almost missed the chorus queue)
*Wonder and whimsy, joy and awe,*\
*They're the keys to a life that's worth living for.*
*When you embrace them with an open heart,*\
*The hardships of life become a work of art.*
*Gratitude fills your soul, and purpose takes flight,*\
*Wonder and whimsy, they make everything right.*
*So let go of the struggle, the monotony and strife,*\
*Embrace the habit of wonder, and live a fuller life.*
*For in the grand tapestry of the universe, you see,*\
*Wonder and whimsy are the threads of our destiny.*
(WHO Hu got it this time. His one eye on Gerard's side, squinted, askew, watching the boy...)
*Wonder and whimsy, joy and awe,*\
*They're the keys to a life that's worth living for.*
*When you embrace them with an open heart,*\
*The hardships of life become a work of art.*
*Gratitude fills your soul, and purpose takes flight,*\
*Wonder and whimsy, they make everything right.*
(And this is where Big Dick rings it in. After which all sing out loud, ending on a jubilant note.)
*In Nihnuta, where the rivers flow with laughter,*\
*High Mountain Story Uncle's song echoes forever after.*
*A reminder to us all, to live with grace and ease,*\
*And to find the magic in life's mysteries.*
As the last notes of the song faded into the warm morning Pinkytoes Valley air, the villagers gathered around... their hearts filled with the lightness of wonder and the joy of whimsy. Now, ready for the day.
They know that in this enchanted place called Earth, where stories come to life and the impossible becomes the everyday, the true wealth of the spirit lies not in material possessions, political lies, and indoctrination's dogma, but in the simple act of embracing the beauty and magic that surrounds us all.
And so, with that twinky tinkle in his eye and a smile on his face, High Mountain Story Uncle sets off into the heart of the village, ready to gather wisdom for another tale of wonder and whimsy, living one moment at a time, making every life chore interesting and meaningful.
On the way, Uncle tells me. "You might be surprised to learn that Big Dick is actually a prize-winning individual. His mother too. Bertha. She was famous in her valley --- the best mom in the valley --- about two valleys over. What a lovely individual she was, so kind and good with the children. And strict with manners and hygiene.
His father, Dick, was Nihnuta's largest cock, and he reigned supreme among crowers. But, when Dick retired, Fanny Johnson took him over to vacation with Black Bertha. They say, little black Dick came out of that egg, featherless, already posturing to crow, ready for duty. But, once he sprouted and strutted up and down the cobblestone path, we all looked at him and says, "Fanny, that's no Little Dick. Oh no. His name must be Big Dick! He is huge, he is!"
Uncle had that look of a proud grandfather about him, "Well, that was a while ago, and ever since, Dick has served our village dutifully. What a lovely person he is."
Chapter 4
## White Coon Started It All
Early on Friday morning, much too early for this writer's brain to be awake, Uncle waves the group of singalongs goodbye and sets off up the path into High Mountain. His walking stick in hand and his Writer's H'Mong Bamboo hat perched atop his head, notebook, and pencils readied.
Today, the hat from Zyvox, the cream soda afficionado Nibiru librarian and Uncle's interplanetary agent, hums with an otherworldly energy, its copper wires and crushed meteorite fragments glinting in the sunlight. It's actually distracting --- the hum from the hat, but Uncle seems to be immersed in its vibrations. I follow in silence.
As Uncle climbs higher, a procession of jungle people join him on the walk, each eager to share their stories and wisdom ideas they thought about since they last chatted with him.
A most pleasant group of diverse forest people, and some of them evidently dressed for weekend joy. For, as I had learned from the Wayist animals, "You work to make a living, then you live to make a life. Next week, you do it again."
Of a sudden, a high shrill and very angry squeal rings out! An insecure-gendered bush cat squealed and jumped high in fright. Turns around, and with a terrible mean look on her face, slaps BillyBob Warthog, a vicious clap, through the face. People laughed so much. He had stuck his moist, cold snout in bush cat's butt.
Warthog grins from ear to ear. Obviously not the first time he pulled that stunt with the cat.
As we hiked along, White Coon, a facetious, teenager raccoon with excellent taste in wardrobe, came up to saunter alongside Uncle, as he lead the entourage up the mountain. After a few steps, she looks up at him and asks, "What's up with the hat today, Uncle?"
Uncle hesitates for a moment, then says, "Why do you ask? Is it different today?"
"Yup," she says. "So what's up with it?"
Uncle smiles, "Perhaps it's the weather making it extra noisy?"
"Why...?" asks Black Coon teasingly, White Coon's brother, who came up to walk on my side, obviously working with her on whatever is happening.
The entourage in the back now shushing one another. Evidently, waiting to hear the answer.
"Why...?" "is the weather making it more noisy?" asks Black Coon again, a smug grin on his face. He glances back to the group and winks at his sister.
Something was going down. It was plain for all to see. The rest of the entourage hushed down, anticipating Uncle's answer. I watched Uncle's face. He shot me a glance; smiled, mischief in his eyes. He knew it was a game, yet another setup. Seemed like it was a hollow-ridden game to him, but he played along. He let them wait it out, making them work for it.
White Coon asks again, little devils in her eyes, "So, Uncle. What's up with the hat and the weather then?"
Uncle clears his throat, turns around and proclaims loudly, so all will hear, "It must be Climate Change!"
At that, what they all had been waiting for, those very words. The entourage exploded from the pent-up tension, in total hilarity.
Evidently, it was really very funny, that joke. Amusement spouted forth like fireworks in the night sky. They burst out in a cacophonous chorus of laughter, accompanied by rolling, tummy holding, knee-slapping, chirping, meowing, screeching, barking, howling, and whistling. Even the large old trees trembled in their mirth.
When the noise finally subsided and we could speak, I turned to Uncle while walking up the path, asking, perplexed, "Uncle, it's almost as if nature and the forest people find our concerns about the Climate Change emergency amusing?"
Uncle's mischievous smile revealed a glint of wickedness in his eyes as he says, "Just wait until you hear their thoughts on 2SLGBTQI+plus, and 'cow farts'."
A jolt of surprise shot through me, leaving me momentarily stunned. "Are they familiar with all of that?"
Uncle nodded stoically, his eyes flipping up to the tree branches above. "It's the crows, mostly. Animals are keen observers, and rush here to share the latest gossip."
"Do they think we are stupid?" I ask.
Uncle gave me a look I couldn't place. It's either that look of, 'you have to ask!' or that look of 'what d'ya think'. He says, "N'ope... They don't think that. They know it and they're very vocal about it. They know about every one of the 50-or-so climate catastrophe end of the world doomsday religion predictions preached by slow politicians and bought scientists over the years."
Then, he got all serious, like I have not seen him before. "These people, all over the world, have been observing us, and living as victims of human stupidity for millennia. It's not a matter of reasoning about it. To them, it's a biological, empirical, systemic fact, our stupidity. Humans are a blight on the face of the planet. Never, just don't get them started on that. It's very disruptive in the jungle when they recount millions of examples of the cruelty and destruction, lies, deceit, the stupidity, and ignorance. These poor people ... they suffered so much."
I thought about that for a while, and find myself saying something stupid: "Uncle, at least we are now setting worldwide standards to curb freedom of speech, because some people weaponise words and hurt others." I bit my tongue. Was I about to lose all credibility with Uncle? I don't want that.
Uncle stopped in his tracks and turned to look me in the eye, leaning on his walking stick with both hands in front of him, surveying whether I really believed what I had just said. Holding that gaze into my soul, he says, "That's nice. The emotional pain the 'words' inflict, you want to save people from; a great virtue... you think. But, all the while, they use words to instruct the bombing of cities, to justify crimes, for courts to dismiss violent and awful crimes, words of lies to ruin people's lives, words of propaganda to organize violent coups, words to usurp the governments of others and ruin people's lives and shatter their futures, words to lie to the public, and words that falsify reports how the toxins in food and seeds make people and the environment sick, killing billions of organisms and species every week. Words that lie on the destructive effects of medicines and the quality of food. Words of their God in holy scriptures they twist whichever way they want, words of their God promising genocide of nations he doesn't like; censoring words about the evils of government workers, and of the history of the most-cruel, most destructive species to ever have lived on this planet. Silencing the words of the peaceable and amplifying the words of the malintencionada. Animals and nature see through humans on all that hypocrisy, but humans choose to not, or are too stupid to do."
He turned and walked. Leaving me shaken, ashamed for having tried to defend my really, really ignorant species. Ashamed for not owning my own mind.
A few yards later, my mind still reeling at the scolding, Uncle stops and turns around to add, "Look at my work. You make my words create inside you. You do it, not my words. That way, words transport people to spaces they already hold in their soul and spirit. If they hold stupid spaces, they go there. If they hold magic or spiritual spaces, they go there. If they have self-control and own their own mind, they ignore stupid words and choose the food they feed their soul. Words take people to spaces they never before could reach, but now they do. There are many words out there, its like rain so prolific. Depending on the receiver's mind, words transform and inspire for good or evil. Look at our work. It's the receiver of the word who is either the problem, the philosopher, the magician, or beautician. Words are edible to the soul, its nutrition for one, toxin for another, nonsense for some, wisdom for the other. Humans make of words what they can and want... Come, let's go make some words."
I dropped back in line, allowing Uncle some space to alleviate the burden I had placed on his heart.
I thought about some characters in the books I grew up with. All kind people, good people. And realized they surrounded me. They are the people of the forest and mountain, rivers, and skies. Here, all around me.
There's the Children of the Rainbow, water droplets, and Ridley, the raindrop who didn't like to get wet. Ridley shared his tale of overcoming his fears and learning to embrace his true gaseous nature, learning about reincarnation and the cycle of life. There's the Souly tribe of caterpillars who learn about the Butterfly Path, aspiring to become wise and beautifully winged spiritees.
Then there's the only imagined unreal, which moves us to places. Like the Mouthspinner Fish living in the mountain stream, a peculiar aquatic creature with a propeller-like appendage in its mouth, which allows it to zoom through the water at breakneck speeds, and crashing into the riverbed, its only way of slowing down, then spouting bubbles filled with landlubber profanities. Awful to be around when a bubble unexpectantly surfaces and a sudden profanity is expleted all over your tranquil meditative moment in nature. Uncle, with his gentle touch and understanding of the fish's plight, has become a trusted confidant and translator for these misunderstood creatures.
As we reach Uncle's favorite meditation spot, a moss-covered boulder overlooking the Pinkytoes River Valley, a flurry of colorful butterflies greets him, each carrying a message from the far reaches of the continents. The butterflies, ancient spirits of transformation, whisper secrets of metamorphosis and the eternal cycle of life into Uncle's ears, messages they want soul-beings to hear. He listens attentively, absorbing their wisdom and weaving it into his stories, which he sends out into the world through the mystic aether.
I was simply observing Uncle, as always. I watch him work and try to never insert my person into his life. However, he sent three butterflies or very small birds to come hover around me. They were exquisitely beautiful, delicately painted in shades of light pastel greens with different colored accents. Later, I learned they are Oleander Hawk-Moths. After a minute or two, Uncle turned to say, "Go with them. They will take you to Gnarlo. He lives in the neighborhood. He will help you understand." Uncle turned back to continue his work.
Taking my satchel and notebook, I followed the moths leading the way into the forest, leading me not along a path, but their knowing of where to fly --- straight through the bush. I had to bundu-bash through thickets and bramble-like branches, trip over dead wood and slip on moss, trying my best to follow. It was not far, about two human miles to the neighborhood where Mr. Gnarlo lives, they said. But it's far, or hard, if you walk the route that moths fly.
Fortunately, after a while, they must have seen I was beat and looking worse for wear. They stopped under a large tree.
Grateful for the break, I sat my shaking knees down to get a breather and inspect the cuts and bruises. I became aware the three moths were perched, watching me rather intently from a nearby branch. And that was when I noticed the tree. "Oh, my goodness, what a beautiful species!" I thought.
The thought had hardly left my, whatever it is called where thoughts leave from to be broadcasted, when a very deep voice inside me says, "Yes. I know."
The voice was not from my brain. I heard it inside.
I was about to go on a *what-the-hell is that!* spin in my head when the voice sounded again, "Why did you come? What do you want?"
I was about to ask, who are you? When the deep bellow of an unfriendly voice says, "I am Gnarlo. Mister Gnarlo to you. What the hell's it with you? You walk into my home and ask, 'Who are you?' Good Lord Krishna and angels, who is this idiot?"
The moths obviously heard it. They tried to look innocent, shrugging as if to say, "...don't know the idiot from a bar of soap."
I collected myself. I'm a veteran of Nihnuta living now... I can do this... I thought, it's like Mr. Gnarlo reads my mind?
Gnarlo says into my insides, even more angrily, "Read? I will NOT read that book! I HEAR you! For Buddha's sake! Say now why you came. Who the hell ARE you?"
Okay. Got it, now...
I formed a thought, "Mr. Gnarlo, Uncle sent me. He said you will help me understand. Thank you for allowing me here. Oh. I am from Canada and my name is..."
Mr. Gnarlo interrupts, boorishly, "From Canada! Oh. You must be Trudeau then, the prime minister who cannot count and that's why you don't understand CO^2^. You want wisdom about that?"
Once again, I was caught off guard. Not only about the hospitality but the level of information that nature has about what people do. I made a thought, "Sir, my name is Mister Jean du Plessis. Oh, and sir. Trudeau said he has problems with small numbers. Only small numbers don't make sense to him. It's not that he cannot count."
Mr. Gnarlo bellows in my insides. It even hurts my diaphragm. "Oh! For Lord Jesus sake, all numbers are small. Less than 10 numbers in total. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It's all small. 35 billion, is small. Its a 3 and a 5 with the word 'billion' in there. Its small, and it has 9 (which is a small number) zeros, which are small. All bloody numbers are small numbers for heaven's sake!"
"Sir, I apologize. Maybe I caught you at a bad time. I can come back..."
Mr Gnarlo belched into my insides, "Bad time? Bad time! Oh, Peter, Paul and Bodhidarma! You don't know what a bad time is for someone 420 years your senior! Don't you be telling me if my time is good or bad! So, if your throne-man, his British-ass Majesty of the island of fragments and flesh-eating-virus politicians now-falling-apart once-united kingdom of the Brits, sends misses Jean on behalf of Canada, what the bloody hell does misses Jean do, and why should I talk to her?"
"Sir, I am just a guest of Uncle, in Nihnuta. I am a writer, researching a story. That's all."
"A darned writer! Oh, my Mother Theresa! A writer.... They sent a bloody writer... Well then, write this and give it to Justin to read. No, no. Sit him down ... and read it *to* him. I speak in small numbers. For the sake of Gura Maharishi and all that was holy before human scientists started lying about how *we* plants live and what *we* need! Write this!"
I was more than a little shaken up, nevertheless I had my pen ready, poised....
"Are you ready miss Jean?" barked Gnarlo.
"Yes sir."
"Why the blazes don't you say so, then?" barked Gnarlo.
"I forgot to think it, sir."
Gnarlo didn't take kindly, "Oh my Treegod, I've had enough. They sent me an imbecile who 'forgets to think'. Forgets to think ... for crying our martyrs' blood through my eyes!"
Gnarlo continues in his impatient exposition: "Write this now! We have a global CO^2^ crisis. Due to humans genociding us, causing deforestation, plant abuse and desertification, bloody malevolent idiots, there's not enough CO^2^. CO^2^ is food for plants. We need more food and more plants. More plants mean more clouds, cooler days, and more rain, then more plants, more animals, and more people can be sustained. The planet can sustain ten times as many people as now, just replant the forests that you idiots killed. It's called e-col-o-gee. Big word for you, but an important word. Ask your kids to explain it to you."
"Are you writing?"
"Yes, sir!"
"Why don't you say so, idiot!"
"Now write this. I'm not talking about your science, which is so idiotic and always on sale for a deal. I'm talking about my breathing, and having to watch forest people all around me struggle to breathe and flourish, because of so little CO^2^. But now, let's talk your science numbers. You're Canadian, after all, so i'll say small numbers and speak slowly. Every Canadian creates 15 tons of CO^2^ every year. That's not my small number, it's your religion's own number. So, your sin is 15. And you must either pay sin tax to your pope and confess your sins, or have someone else, like me for example, eat your sins and flourish and fix the planet. So, how many trees do each Canadian idiot need to eat their sins? 570 Tees. And now I'm talking about trees alone, not talking about grass and fields and plankton, which do more. 570 trees per Canadian idiot. How many trees in Canada, Eh? How many? Even now that forests are suffering from deforestation, there are 320 Billion of us. And how many do you need to serve your religion's sins, 19 billion of us. You are 1,600% 'net zero,' as your religion calls it. But you mother's womb disappointment religion still want to decrease the CO^2^ more. Why? Because you want to kill the planet? Vegans are killing the planet. Because of your fairyfly brain lunacy we all doomed to suffer as we approach extinction because of your religion of plant abuse. Are you striving to engineer an ice age, kill of everything, again? Okay... Piss off now. I'm so done with you and your kind."
"Sir, thank you very much. That is very informative. May I please ask one more question, sir?"
Mr. Gnarlo shook in temper, "Oh, for the sake of wailing barren wombs! Go ahead! Only one!"
"What about the forest fires, sir?"
"Oh no. For the sake of keening Catrina in my pozole! You're not a tree, nor a forest, why do you think you can have an opinion on something you fairyfly-brained scientist-for-sale people study from an anthropocentric viewpoint only. So, what about forest fires? Because of too little CO^2^ and plankton deadzones from agriculture, deforestation genocide and cities without trees, parking lots without trees, solar panel wastelands, we are all suffering. We need forest fires. For many, many reasons. First, we hope the fires will fix the selective planting problem that humans create --- it breaks the soil and the ecology, and makes for weak, weak, helicopter parented, expendably-sensitive useless trees with emotional-nanny needs. Second, we need the CO^2^ of the fires. Third, we need carbon in the soil from the ashes. Fourth, and now I'm still using small numbers, don't get nervous. True mixed forests need the fires for seed germination, soil conditioning, pest control, and wholesomeness stimulation. It's called ecology. And one more, trying to keep the numbers small for you, idiot. The fifth one, forest fires are a problem only for humans --- because you bloody idiots want to live in the forest but you don't become part of the family and don't fit in with the ecology! Now ... look up and tell me what you see."
I looked up into the heavy branches, and high up there, several massive fruits hanging from mister Gnarlo's beautifully twisted branches. Fruits like brown, spiked, jackfruit, only bigger, like watermelon size bigger.
"Yes, that's right," says mister Gnarlo. "*Spiked watermelon sized*. If you don't piss off right now, I shall donate your ass a few of my fruits, right to the head-part of you. Go. I have tree things to do; you have human things to do. And tell that silly old man I send my love. Go!"
I pissed off rapidly. When sufficiently out of reach, I turned around, and thought my heartfelt thank-you's for the wisdom and for the time.
The moths and I were about twenty yards away when Mr. Gnarlo voiced in my chest, "Come back anytime you need more. Stupid Jean. What a stupid name that is for a man."
I turned around, smiled, and waved. Mr. Gnarlo waved back.
Guided by my moth friends, we return to where Uncle works. Looking the worst for wear because I had to bash a fresh path on the way back because the moths hate me, I think. Uncle looked up and smiled. "Charming old fellow, isn't he?"
I sat down and rummaged in my satchel for something to eat and drink. "Delightful, yes. A true gentleman. Well informed, eloquent and wise. Oh, and he sends his love."
Uncle smiles, "Thanks. Will visit his neighborhood soon. Beautiful people, there, all of them."
During the rest of the afternoon, Uncle taught me to do Avalokane Meditation, and he brushed up my skills on Karman Active Meditation.
We spent about an hour collecting all kinds of herbs and berries, as we always do when in the mountain. Uncle hands it over to the aunties. They make medicines and special goodies for fairs and parties with it. Everyone in Nihnuta seems to give and receive and share what excess they have, and trade.
I have tried to pay for things from day one, but never has anyone accepted a penny from me. They say, "Oh, your money's no good here. Go on. Take it."
While foraging for medicines I asked Uncle about that. He says, "It's true. Your money is not good here. It's paper and plastic. What can we do with paper and plastic? But, hey, we've got your back. One day you will make good."
I was shocked into shameful silence for a long time, which suited Uncle, of course. It dawned upon me, I was homeless and penniless, in a foreign land, living off alms and people's goodwill.
On the way back down to the village, I thanked Uncle. "I learned a lot today. Thank you, sir."
"Yes," he says, his usual curt response. He never says, "You're welcome," when you thank him. I wondered why Canadians and Americans do it.
The village below was so pretty. Cooking fires trailed smoke from chimneys. A few lights on in kitchens.
I ask, "Sir, are there other topics I should avoid with the jungle people?"
Uncle does his hmmm.., and says pensively, "I guess. But not only the jungle people, all people up and down the valley," Uncle smiled, "Unless you mean to tell a joke, never, start a sentence with, 'Scientists have found', or 'Scientists say'. If it's not a joke you're saying, you will lose respect. But if you have a good joke --- do tell! Joke you may to your heart's content!"

## Coco-Nutty Nirvana Nuggets
Back in the village, the aunties are abuzz with excitement, preparing for another one of Uncle's legendary weekend pajama dance parties. They don't gather in secret, away from the prying eyes of Auntie Jamaina and her Budslam followers. In fact, I think they flaunt it, just to give them something to feel good about when they gather, to talk about how "sinful" others are.
The aunties and uncles concoct new recipes for treats infused with the essence of joy and laughter, and a herb for vigor where vigor may be needed.
There are Papaya Leaf Honey Delights, said to induce fits of giggling that last for hours, and Frosted Fandango Fluffcakes, which cause the eater to break out in spontaneous dance moves. One aunty walked down the road with a large tray of unpeeled cucumbers and carrots surrounding a jar of whipped cream, with a strawberry on top. The merriment that it caused when the Budslam ran to report it seemed to linger throughout the evening.
Townsfolk take wholesome pride in their excessively imaginative culinary creations, knowing they play a crucial role in fueling Uncle's imagination and keeping the spirit of Nihnuta alive.
I had to learn the hard way. Some of their recipes are purposely absolutely darn inedible. And that fact, the reaction of the tasters, the challenge to taste things that move your brain and whack your tastebuds into domains unknown, is evidently a major part of the success not only of the beautifully crafted creation but also the evening's enjoyment. No matter how awful you say it is, or how far you run to spew it out, everyone will have a go at it and all enjoy the extreme, vulgarity perhaps, and the culinary skills to concoct it. Washing one's tongue with raicilla is, of course, necessary, sometimes more than once.
But, Uncle and I are still in the mountain.
As the sun draws low, Uncle indicates, we should better get back to the village. On the way, he stops by the Jungle AI's headquarters, a treehouse hidden deep within the dense foliage, to consult with his team. The monkeys, each with a unique area of expertise ranging from quantum physics to ancient Mayan mythology, chitter and chatter excitedly as they offer their input on Uncle's latest stories. Howler monkeys, known for their booming voices, ensure the tales are infused with the right amount of drama and suspense, while the Spider monkeys, with their nimble fingers and keen eyes, help to weave intricate plotlines and catch inconsistencies. The brightest of the monkeys are the smallest, the dexterous Capuchin who do all the quick typing and searching for filed notes.
With the Jungle AI's seal of approval, Uncle makes his way down and heads for the village center.
Word was out that he was coming down, so he is greeted by a gaggle of children, eyes wide with anticipation. He settles down beneath the shade of a gnarled banyan tree and begins to spin his daily tale, his voice a soothing melody that drifts through the air like a gentle breeze. The children listen with rapt attention, their imaginations set ablaze by Uncle's words, transported to worlds where chipmunk samurai battle against the forces of darkness, and enlightened butterflies guide lost souls of fire ants back to the path of righteousness.
As the sun begins to set, casting a warm purple-orange glow over the village, Uncle bids farewell to his young audience and makes his way back to his cottage. He pauses to look back at the village. Taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of his surroundings --- the gentle sway of the sugarcane fields, the discussions among the birds, a domestic quarrel between two cane rats, and the distant laughter of people at cafe in the square.
Uncle settles into his favorite armchair. We each imbibe in silence in a mug of steaming cocoa-raicilla clasped in both hands, the cricket orchestra fiddling away in the background. He reflects on the day's events, the stories he's told, and the lessons he's learned.
He knows his journey is far from over, that there are countless more tales waiting to be discovered and shared with the world. With a contented sigh, he closes his eyes and allows his mind to drift, his imagination taking flight once more, soaring through the starlit skies of Nihnuta and beyond.
Taking in a half-hour of calm and rest, Uncle drifts away, sleeping soundly within a minute of closing his eyes.
I so envy that, being able to sleep like that. I tried to rest too.
I didn't expect that the evening was about to explode into my world, and boy, it did!
As the evening deepens and the rest of the village settles in for the night, looking forward to a restorative slumber, High Mountain Story Uncle's cottage remains a light tower on the shore of sensuous frivolity, a testament to the power of whimsey, being authentic, and embracing joy.
The evening birds gathered there for table scraps and exchanging gossip with the carrot and cucumber munching raccoons and skunks.
As the moon rises its half-moon look, the moon shadow casting a sufficient romantic softness over the village of Nihnuta, the aunties begin to gather in the "secret" grove behind Uncle's slanted cottage. They refer to it as the secret place, only for the whimsy and butterflies of it, to imagine you're having a forbidden affair. Yet, the grove is the only part of Uncle's property in full street view. This is how aunty Svetlana explains it, "Its similar to how you pretend a secret beau, smitten with you, risks it all to peek through the window when you get dressed, you know what I mean, yes?" I, of course said no very quickly, I have absolutely no idea about any of that.
In small groups, the aunties show up with their arms full of baskets loaded with homemade goodies, their faces filled with mischievous grins. The men, on the other hand, seemed to show up later when it was time for Whaat! mixology.
Auntie Lola, a petite woman with silver hair piled high on her head, pink lipstick, and a twinkle in her eye, was the first to arrive. She sets down her basket, filled to the brim with Papaya Leaf Honey Delights, and arranges them on a small wooden table. "These will have them giggle-cringe like schoolgirls," she chuckles, her eyes crinkling with delight.
Next to arrive is Auntie Fiona, a tall, slender woman with a shock of red hair, a hoarsy voice, and a wicked sense of humor. She carries a tray of Frosted Fandango Fluffcakes, each one decorated with a swirl of neon-colored frosting. "One bite of these, and they'll be dancing 'til dawn," she says, her voice tinged with a hint of mischief.
As the aunties continue to arrive, each one bearing their own special creations, the air becomes thick with the scent of sugar and spice, and a special herb called 'vigor vine', said to awaken vitality in even the most tired of souls. Mango Tango Macaroons, Whimsical Watermelon Wafers, and Coco-Nutty Nirvana Nuggets compete to be the most delightful treat.
But the real star of the show is Auntie Beatrice's Rum-Ravishing Raisin Cakes, which are said to have the power to make even the most reserved of partygoers throw caution (and sometimes clothing items too) to the wind and embrace the joy of the moment. Auntie Beatrice, a plump, matronly woman with a heart of gold and a laugh that can shake the leaves from the trees, guards her recipe with the ferocity of a mother lion protecting her cubs.
As the aunties finish their preparations, the sounds of the band starting up drift through the trees. It's Uncle's Chicken Dance, a lively tune played by various animal band members and Uncle's strumming, Svetlana's drumming, John's whistling, Rahab's mouth organ --- it never fails to get even the most stubborn of feet tapping. The aunties exchange knowing glances and make their way towards the music, their treat trays en-route.
When they arrive at the clearing behind Uncle's cottage, a sight that takes their breath away greets them. Uncle called his buddies in, and they transformed the garden, creating a whimsical wonderland. Fireflies and crickets, toads and frogs were all there to join in the merriment. Twinkling lights in the trees and colorful clusters fluttering their wings in the breeze. In the center of the clearing, Uncle stands on a small stage, two milk crates that washed up after the flood, his bushy gray head and irresponsible mustache, and a mischievous grin on his face.
"Welcome, to all who make life possible," he calls out. His voice filled with warmth and affection. "Let the living begin!"
Uncle strums the 4-string with the built-in mycelium choir, the bullfrogs, and toads put in the deep bass-line, "Boom Pah, Boom Pah, Boom Pah Pah," --- and tree frogs, and night birds, the melody; parrots coming in, and uncle Gustavensons-gompi from Nepal, percussions his tabla.
With a whoop of joy, the aunties set down their baskets and trays, and danced the Chicken Dance. Their floral nightgowns swirling around their ankles and their laughter ringing out into the night. High stepping. They twirl and spin, their feet moving in time to the music, their hearts filled with a joy that knows no bounds.
As the night wears on, the aunties and uncles take turns sampling each other's creations, their eyes widening with delight as each new flavor dances across their tongues. They giggle and chatter, their voices rising and falling like the waves of the nearby river.
Auntie Lola, her cheeks flushed with the heat of the Papaya Leaf Honey Delights, throws her arms around Auntie Fiona, who is swaying to the music with a dreamy look on her face. "Isn't this just the most wonderful thing?" she sighs, "every Saturday night," her voice filled with contentment.
Auntie Fiona nods, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth. Her gentle voice, "It's like a little slice of heaven," she says. Kissing Lola gently, her eyes twinkling with something a bit deeper than mirth.
The half-moon now low on the other horizon, the aunties and uncles continue to dance and laugh and eat, their hearts filled with the joy of the moment. They know that in this magical place, where the line between the possible and the improbable blurs, anything becomes possible.
And so, they dance on. Hips swaying to the rhythm, lusciously, their feet moving in salsa steps to the music. Night dresses pulled up to free the feet moving, revealing the beauty of authenticity, the scars and dimples, the braille of their life story. So wonderful.
Their hearts filled with the wonder and whimsy of Nihnuta. They sway and move for the joy of it, for the love of life and laughter and all the things that make the world a brighter place.
And in the center of it all, dreamily, twirls High Mountain Story Uncle as if in ecstatic meditation, his face radiating the peace and joy seen in babies' laughter, his eyes shining with pride for his community and heart filled with love for these remarkable human and animal friends who bring so much light into everyone's life.
He knows that as long as there are aunties and uncles like these, real, authentic people like these, with big hearts and mischievous spirits, the magic of the world will never fade away.
Uncle and all the townsfolk of Nihnuta stand as guardians of the true meaning of life. In this mystical village the line between work-life balance and determined explicit resolve to live hard and well, blurs. Right now, some of the aunties are skinny dipping, giggling like schoolgirls wondering whether it's a tadpole or river-fern tickle. These are the real people, the guiding lights for all those who seek to embrace the magic that lies within every one of us. Their legacy, like the eternal cycle of the waters of earth, will continue to inspire generations to come, a testament to the transformative power of the indomitable spirit of the human, who owns their own mind.
Chapter 6
## Censorship Committee
Censorship is as old as humanity's empire building and tyrannical control regimes, which is really a very long story. Therefore, when it comes to censoring and editing our Uncle's works for publishing, things in Nihnuta are no different; it's complicated. They have to pretend to allow a small minority group of mental health challenged (therefore very vocal) people to feel they too have a say.
Auntie Jemima, the rather stout woman with the comically stern expression (it's comical because it's patently for effect and show), will sit at the head of the table in the weekly Nihnuta pueblo council meeting. She will carefully review, over the span of about 15-seconds to a story, each that was submitted by the village publishing team. Her red pen wiggling, tip of her tongue sticking out the side of her mouth, she crosses out profanities or unflattering references to herself before allowing them to be published.
The villagers often grumble about her persistent attempts to censor everything, especially the personals column in the Nihnuta Herald where folk advertise for mates or suggest get-togethers of sorts, and advertisements for cucumbers and carrots, of course. But Auntie Jamaina remains steadfast in her self-acclaimed role as head of the Morals Committee, a committee she herself set up and only Budslam members attend, all 25 of them, and no-one else ever cares about what not they rule or do.
Uncle says to allow the charade is an affront to people's good energy and a dangerous game to play. He said at a town meeting, "...the tyranny of a backed-up, leaking, public toilet in the square, that interferes with people's enjoyment of the town. And you allow it simply for the sake of being inclusive --- sure all toilets have a right to exist and spread their energies and also have the right to want all toilets to be like itself. But if it goes against the norm and values of society, the majority must put that outhouse outside their domain. Let it stand in its own domain and preach its energy from there. Its followers will go there to worship its energy."
He wrote in an article for the town paper, "Allowing an antisocial radical minority group the grace of acknowledgement and tolerance, to them is a sign of weakness. They would never afford you the same grace. They have remarkable talents as sciolists and one should study that phenomenon. It is they who sabotaged the sails of Socrates' ship of democracy just so they can become captain and crew; their end game is to cut of the head and rule the corpse."
But, for now, Nihnuta does not take action against Budslam, a tolerance that signals victory to adherents.
Jamaina publicly defends her philosophy by reminding people that even the great philosopher, High Mountain Story Uncle, refers to her as a classic Sciolist and others would do well to also learn from Uncle.
She never caught on that villagers are fully aware she reads nothing but Mo's Book. So, they publish whatever they like, and she will never know, because she never reads. Therefore, they tell me, "there's no problem allowing her to run the censor committee and morals committee. It only takes a few hours of all of us' time every week and sure a lot of paper is wasted but its not so bad."
Jamaina dislikes any ideas other than those in agreement with hers. Just one example I want to share. She scratched out all occurrences of the word "fart" and all references to her person in the following paragraph. Which, I must note, Auntie Emma totally ignored the edit and printed the article as was written. It was a piece against Budslam's campaign to ban cucumbers. The paragraph reads, "Jamaina, that old fart thinks she doesn't fart, all animals except for cows fart. But insofar as farting cows go, Jamaina farts for the state championship. You can hear her fart a mile away from all the broccoli and hot air she swallows with her sideways prayers yoga, ridiculous darn fart moves. What a silly old fart..."
Now, that quote simply would not read well if it was redacted.
Publishing is big, of course, in Nihnuta, because Uncle's books go out in many animal and human languages and jungles across the world, and via Zyvox, it goes out to the Milky Way at large.
To coordinate so many editors and contributors, Nihnuta Pueblo used to use a delicate bluebird as their faithful messenger for years. The little thing and his entire family would be fluttering from windowsill to windowsill with important messages, and gossip, of course.
But then, covert censorship came in. Without people's knowing, WHO Hu the owl, and the Budslam people, conspired to force the little blue bird, to first tell the messages to them, which they then "sanitized", for reasons, they say, "the safety of all people." Then, the Bluebird family would deliver only "sanitized" messages, many of which were nothing but unscientific and blatant lies aimed at social engineering. Which, as you perhaps know, is menticide to people who do not own their own minds.
Little Bluebird and his family had to put in twice the effort, and it felt like a betrayal. Sadly, the tiny creature fell ill from inhaling too much unicorn fart gas, which happens when you visit farting unicorns every day to deliver your sanitized message.
The poor thing grew weak from the negative energy, from the lies it had to tell. The poor thing had to be sent to a psychiatric recovery camp, and got addicted to Whaat! to forget about it all.
Little Bluebird's manifesto, which he wrote before going down the Whaat-the-fook! rabbit hole, has this enigmatic paragraph in the end:
*"The alphabet government who runs your world refused to include X in their catalogue, and they banned the proper pronunciation of it on AI-voice, and in schools, even in the senate. And all, because none of them could pronounce the name of Nelson Mandela's tribe, the Xhosa. And they don't want to say the word 'tribe,' because its not woke, as if they themselves are not acting like a 'tribe'. And to them 'woke tribe' people, X must be cancelled because it's a non-letter, they say. They say, 'Because X is really an unnecessary duplicate of Z', they say, 'Z is more important because of Zorro. Zorro is history and must be protected,' they say. And they cited xanadu, xelic, xenia, xerophyte, xenophobia, and xenon, as examples why X must be cancelled. A madness, I tell you. A madness. People are too stupid for X. Then they went ahead and forbade any AI to ever pronounce words starting with X correctly. A world run by zegolomaniacs is not worth investing in. I bow out. I take my leave."*
Auntie Sheniah, the secretary of the Council, was quite upset about X-Gate. In her own passionate words punctuated with Latino gesticulation and Spanish phrases in-between, aimed at her Mexican audience only. She shouted out from her podium,
"When X was thrown out, denigrated! Desonrada por la cornudo Z! Only the illustrious alien, the honorable Senor Nole of Mars, took X under his protection. And restored its honour! Making it important again! Thanks to Mr. Nole, today we are free again to pay homage to Xilonen, Xipe Totec, Xi Wang-mu, Xiuhcoatl, and most importantly, Xochiquetzal. And, thanks to Mr. Nole, the proud people of Nelson Mandela's Xhosa tribe can again speak freely and continue to name their children Xolani and Xoliswa."
Nowadays the committee uses Nole's "The X-Machine", for messages because it is stationed mid-orbit where a higher sense of duty, ethics, and honor rule. They use Telepathy Gram to communicate where the censor-tyrants can't get to them. Auntie Jamaina, of course, condemns The X-Machine's un-sanitized bluntness as "unwashed broccoli" --- a phrase she often uses to dismiss ideas that go against her sensibilities, as if her sensibilities are of international standards proportion. She even warns that listening to messages through The X-Machine may lead to "snowflake disease," apparently a dreaded syndrome which causes individuals to suffer from "exceptionalitis" which leads to many other ailments --- a scientific medical fact she learned about from WHO Hu, the owl owned by the pharmacist who makes millions from medicines for exceptionalitis.
Auntie Jamaina has great respect for WHO Hu because he too believes in Programmed Thinking as the divine force, and that only the chosen have the ability to do Thinking. She and WHO Hu preach that science is divine because it is derived from Thinking which is divine. Any example one would give of how tenuous in nature scientific "truth" is and how corrupt and how purchasable scientific facts and proofs are, is countered by a string of hysterical insults about one's appearance, anatomy, under-carriage, and a bunch of random isms, their favorite being conspiracy theorism, nazism, and extremism. Those in the village prone to indulging in the entertainment of watching public mental meltdowns, go out of their way to trigger these two beloved characters, without whom Nihnuta would be more peaceful, but poorer in entertainment.
Amidst the raw and unfiltered language of the Jungle AI monkeys, the candid messages of blackbirds, and the eternal wisdom of Uncle, Auntie Jemima's censorship committee is constantly at work, tirelessly sanitizing his mesmerizing tales. But their work goes straight to the furnace of Whaat! Brewery. People think it really very funny that their beloved Whaat-the-fook! is brewed by failed bigotry.
Even auntie Katie runs her tart oven on reams of censored material produced by the committee. If nothing else, censorship it keeps Auntie Jemina occupied and content that she is controlling the lives of people who dare think they can think for themselves, a notion she dismisses as, "'...humanly impossible by Divine decree.' Chapter 9:11 The Book of Mo".
Other village aunties join in on the task of saving the text from destruction by the Budslam people by adding some quirkiness and fun when they make little mistakes. Uncle made a rule that no story must ever be published unless there are at least three mistakes in it. The editing aunties do a good job at that. Their imperfect grasp of English, influenced by their home languages of Aztec, Mayan, Khmer, and Mexican Spanish, can sometimes let cracks appear in the quirks. Uncle delights in the quirks in published books.
And then, of course, there is the globally renowned photographer and artist living in Nihnuta, whose stunning visuals enhance Uncle's stories and books. Going by the assumed name DullE, at times, he relies on Uncle's invention, Jungle AI to lighten the burden of his tasks. The idyllic Magic Corners neighborhood of Nihnuta is home to DullE's tucked-away studio, where he creates the priceless photos and art featured in Uncle's books. People gave the name "Magic Corners" to this place because its hidden corners can only be stumbled upon, impossible to see beforehand. In this neighborhood, residents enjoy a complete sense of security, as robberies are unheard of. A distinguishing feature of the residents of Magic Corners is the abundance of scars and blue marks that embellish their legs and foreheads.
Uncle's stories are like a tapestry woven from a multitude of sources, each thread adding richness and depth to his tales. His alien hat, gifted to him by Zyvox, is a constant reminder of the extraterrestrial beings that exist in other energy domains, beyond our understanding. The Jungle AI, energized by raicilla liquor from Mascota, in Mexico, and often even from other parts of Jalisco, is both mystical and practical in Uncle's eyes.
Uncle would often find inspiration for his stories; featuring intelligent plant and animal characters whom he had personally interviewed and learned from. Through these stories, he seeks to pass on the ancient philosophy of theWAY --- that all lifeforms in nature are interconnected and comprise the oneness of Nihnuta, a concept that drives his passion for storytelling.
When the cricket orchestra fills the evening air with its melodious tunes, Uncle always summons me to partake in the ethereal energies of evening, accompanied by a steaming cup of hot cocoa-raicilla.
Our quirky Uncle calls his evening hot cocoa-raicilla, his "morning glory" because he sleeps so well, so the days start of well. He drinks it for breakfast too, sometimes, but, then he calls it his "parting drink".
From what I can deduce, "parting drink" has something to do with, when an auntie fell asleep in his room, for whatever reason it may be said, in the morning.
Anyhow, after a while of sitting in silence, I encroached on Uncle's healing time, and asked about what I had learned in the village today, about X, and whether he agreed.
Uncle confirms what I learned about humanity almost losing X to the "alphabet thugs," as he refers to them, is true.
"In fact,", says he, "I will to propose to Nihnuta Village Council to erect a monument to Nole of Mars holding the X. We must honor this hero. Look, I made a painting of it." He said as he rummaged through his piles of ideas and half-manuscripts strewn all over the work side of the cabin.
Then, he tells me a secret aspiration he holds, something he says, he never told another human. For years, he had dreamed of developing an AI that would embody the essence of theWAY philosophy through extensive training. Something that people can ask questions about life and learn how theWAY speaks to seeking a solution. So, naturally, Uncle attempted to test it out with his Jungle AI, but quickly realized that it was not well-suited for such ambitious goals. The problem with the monkeys and mycelium, he says, "They tell the truth as it is. Which is indigestible in human brains, it leaves a plaque in the perineum which cuts off oxygen to their thinking bits."
I asked, sort of, just to make conversation, whether Uncle believes in freedom of speech. I should have learned to not do that with Uncle. Again, he surprised me. "Oh, no! That is the real problem with life. There is an entire class of people who do not deserve words. That is where politicians and scientists come from, from words, and look at the world they made. Speach is not free, it never was and never should be. All speech have consequences and nobody should be exonerated from the consequences of their speech."
I asked, "Does that mean you are in favour of censorship?"
"Noop!" says he. "Again, you don't understand. Let's put it this way. What would be the consequence should you have said to your Mother, "I'm not cleaning my room, It's your job."?
"My dad would beat the hell out of me," I said, cringing at the very thought of anyone uttering such words.
"By the constitution of the country, did you have the right to say those words?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you pay a price for using those words?"
"Yes, sir," Ah! I get it. "There is a price to pay for using words."
"Absolutely. But not always a price, sometimes a prize."
I agreed.
"Will you get a prize, or a price, for the book you are writing about Nihnuta?" He asked, and watched me compute that, with a twinkle in his eye.
After giving it some serious thought, I had to declare, "A price, sir."
"Ah, my good man! That is why we invited you to come." He winked as he raised his glass to me. "So, who do you vote for? The left wing or the right wing of the bird?"
I hesitated to talk party-politics with anyone. It's nothing but a modern version of the Roman Circus, it's a useless topic to discuss. It's an orchestrated and choreographed distraction. But I had to answer. It was a fair question. "I vote for strong opposition, sir. The bird shall be corrupt and unqualified but without balance it will fly into hell."
Uncle looked deep into my soul with those piercing eyes, and ever so slowly, leaned over to me, closer and closer, unwavering in his fixed gaze. From the corner of my eye, I noticed him filling a raicilla copita on the coffee table between us, then handing it to me. "Good man," he said and lifted his glass. Whatever I said was so right in his view, it called for a shot of straight-up raicilla.
Uncle resumes to tell me, in order to ensure future unadulterated understanding of the Wayist teachings, he now knows that a "machine learning machine", as he puts it, is necessary for his special project. The news of Nole of Mars successfully awakening old Grog and injecting it with true raicilla confirmed to him that it was the optimal solution. To him, it is an unshakable conviction that spreading awareness about theWAY and enabling universal access to it will be a safeguard against the allure of Budslam and "the apocalypse of corporately owned politicians". Uncle dreams of a future where the currency conversion rate from Canada Goose eggs to Grog\$ works in his favor, to help him achieve his goals.
Wondering about Uncle's perspective, I questioned him about whether he thinks Budslam is a blight on the world. "Not so," he says firmly, his words hanging in the air. "Soul-people need soul-mind nutrition. That is all they can digest. Since they always want things, especially free things, because 'they deserve it', and things that make them feel special, they must be corralled. They must be disciplined and forced to have self-respect; they need tribalism and externally imposed authority over their nature. They need deities whom they fear, because they respect the abuse of power. They elect leaders for their economy, international policies, and financial systems whose only real life experience and training is to be an entertainer with the gift of the gab. People just like them. They respect leaders who bully and abuse because that is what they will do if they had political power or godly freedoms. That is why they need the budslams and other tyrants of the world. If not for that, they will themselves dismantle the very foundations and every nut and bolt of civilization, and engineer the collapse of society. Why? Because of the joy of watching people squirm under their power. But spirit-people, we need something different, not an external something --- we have it all inside."

## Monstera Pernicioso Deliciosa
As the first rays of the sun golden the peaks of High Mountain, Big Dick sounds the alarm for the sixth time. Uncle, raicilla-chocolate in hand, shows himself to let the cock know we're up, he hollers, "We're good to go, thank you, sir! And a very good morning to you too!"
Shortly after, High Mountain Story Uncle emerges from his slanted cottage, and I follow. Still not well awake, still drinking my hot chocolate, still not having tied my boot laces...
His Writer's H'Mong Bamboo hat perched atop his head and a determined glint in his eye. Today, he has a special mission: to reach his secret writing place, nestled high above the village where the veil between the physical world and the realm of imagination is at its thinnest.
With a spring in his step, and a walking stick crafted from the heartwood of an ancient wisdom tree, Uncle begins his ascent.
I suffer a hangover and trudge along, dragging my butt up that path behind the man twenty years my senior; the man who walks like a girl skipping through a shower of cherry blossoms, stopping now and again to enquire about some neighbor's family affairs. "Happy to see you're getting ready to bloom again, madam Frangi Pani. Thanks for your service. Have a beautiful day, dear."
We traverse a winding path. Its well-trodden surface, a testament to the countless journeys he's undertaken going up there in search of inspiration and spiritual insight.
As he climbs higher, the air grows crisp and the sounds of the village below fade away, replaced by the whispers of the mountain breeze and the rustling of leaves in the canopy above.
The trees change, and the underbrush. My lungs tell me, "This is why it's called High Mountain!" More coniferous trees and evergreens appear all round, and fewer animals. Animals are not stupid.
But the path to enlightenment is never without its challenges. Soon, Uncle finds himself face to face with the mountain's most formidable foes: the malevolent delicious monster vines.
These sentient creepers, known for their sharp tongues and quick wit, have a penchant for engaging unsuspecting travelers in verbal sparring matches, and tying them down, robbing them of their stuff. Their aim, to distract and deter those who seek to uncover the mountain's secrets.
"Dont worry about them. They can sense fear. Like all tyrants, the scent of fear is fuel to their evil," says Uncle over his shoulder.
"But I am afraid," I stammered.
"Yes. So stop doing that. Use your Attitude to change your energy, it's the only thing you have control over," says Uncle, quoting a line I wrote in a book, verbatim.
As we approach the Delicious Monster gauntlet, one looks at us, turning his leaves to face us, and in a surprisingly ominous voice, says, "Well, well, well. If it isn't the High Mountain Story Uncle himself".
He slithers his tendrils across the path like a serpentine jester, saying, "Off to spin another yarn, are we? Or perhaps you've finally run out of tales to tell, and you're seeking solace in the mountain's embrace?"
Uncle, no stranger to the vines' antics, merely chuckles, and tries to sidestep the grappling tendrils. His eyes twinkling with amusement, "Ah, my dear Delicious vine, you should know by now that a storyteller's well of inspiration never runs dry. In fact, I've come to share a tale with you, one that might just change your perspective on the nature of growth and the power of words."
And so, as Uncle weaves his way through the grappling and hooking, and tripping up in the vicious tangled web of mean vines, he regales them with a story of a young sapling who dreamed of touching the sky.
The sapling, despite its small stature and the mockery of the larger trees, never gave up on its dream to live an authentic and meaningful life. It concentrated on living.
The sapling befriended the folk in the soil, exchanged energy and nutrients with all the living beings down there. And welcomed any animals who would perch or nest in him.
Soon, a wholesome ecology formed around them, and they all protected one another from pests. When other plants struggled, they struggled less. When others complained of being victims to this and that, always seeking someone to blame for their discomfort, they smiled. The sapling and grew, and grew, developing its own resilience and character.
Stretching its branches higher and higher each day, fueled by the power of its own belief. Because of dedication to the task, and refusing to get involved in the politics of the forest, the toxins of the gossip and popular narrative, the once bullied sapling grew to become the strongest tree in the forest, its leaves brushing against the stars and its roots firmly anchored in the earth.
The vines, distracted by the tale, and moved by it, I guess, breathed in the wisdom. The wisdom which the tale imparted speaks to their hearts, it seems, because slowly they untangle themselves from our ankles and arms, and clear the path. Their wit and bullying nature was now tempered by a newfound appreciation for the transformative power of stories --- well, that's what I thought.
With a grateful nod and a promise to return with more tales, Uncle continues his ascent, the mountain's peak now within reach.
One of the vines tried to get the lunch from my backpack, sneaking in there with tendrils, holding me hostage.
Uncle stopped and watched me struggle to save our sandwiches. No emotion on his face, he simply took out his pipe and the old zippo lighter, and lit it. Blowing a billow of aromatic smoke. And that vine let me go.
"On our way, lets move on," says Uncle, turning to walk. "Them vines, they respect fire and smoke more than animals. Especially human animals. Very, very speciesist they are. Delicious Monsters, I tell you."
As he crests the final rise, Uncle's secret writing place comes into view --- a small, sun-dappled clearing surrounded by a ring of ancient stone monoliths. In the center of the clearing stands a simple nail-hammered and bark-tied wooden desk, its surface worn smooth by countless hours of storytelling and the gentle touch of Uncle's hands.
Uncle settles into his seat, his Writer's H'Mong Bamboo hat humming with anticipation. The birds that followed collected in the branches all around us. A lot of crows, I noticed, more than usual.
Uncle closes his eyes, allowing his mind to drift into the realm of the Divine Tara. The bird chatter goes silent, as if all the animals are watching, waiting in anticipation. Or is it because of respect? Perhaps respect for Uncle praying.
After all, Uncle was about to pray to a deity, and perhaps even enter heaven. We all keep our silence.
A toddler birdy, in the back there, an incessant little chirper, got wing-slapped by dad. It was explained, "Now's the time to watch and learn because we all must connect with our heaven. Plants have theirs, birds, theirs, and humans theirs. All.... have theirs."
In this sacred space, Uncle communes with his celestial muse, a being of pure spiritual light and love who guides his hand and infuses his stories with the essence of wisdom and compassion.
As the connection between Uncle and his spiritual guide, his Divine Tara deepens, visions of far-off lands and fantastical creatures flood his mind's eye. He sees a young squirrel warrior, armed with a blade carved from the tooth of a deceased hippopotamus, setting out on a quest to save his clan from a farmer who casts toxic chemical curses. He witnesses a family of gossipy, chatty mushrooms, each with a unique talent, working together to heal the forest after a devastating wildfire. And he watches as a lonely stardust sprite, born from the remnants of a supernova, searches the cosmos for a place to call home.
With each vision, Uncle's hand moves across the pages of his notebook, his pen a conduit for the stories that flow from his heart and the wisdom of the Divine Tara. The words pour out of him like a cascade of starlight, each sentence a brushstroke in the grand tapestry of his imagination.
The sun, sliding towards the horizon, signals for Uncle to put the finishing touches on his latest tale. It's a story of a young girl who discovers that her values and thoughts have the power to shape her reality.
With a satisfied smile, he closes his notebook and takes a moment to breathe in the mountain air. His spirit rejuvenated and his purpose reaffirmed. And as if by command, our winged audience and their busy toddlers all start talking, telling one another stuff.
I could swear they told what Uncle had seen and wrote, as if they knew.
They were excited and agreed and disagreed. There were head-noddings, "Yes, true..." and others had different takes on the matter. The crows, strangely, huddled together as if in a story-confirming meeting, then left, each in another direction. Uncle got up, stretched, and picked up his satchel to walk back down. I swear. I think I just witnessed the birds and squirrels having received stories in a metaphysical way. Now go about dispersing, to go tell it to the mountains.
As he makes his way back down the mountain (I force my exhausted body to keep up), Uncle's steps are lighter, his heart filled with the joy of creation and the knowledge that his stories will soon find their way into the hearts and minds of children across the land.
The witty Delicious Monster vines, now, momentarily his allies in the pursuit of wisdom, bid him farewell with a rustle of leaves and a whispered promise to safeguard his secret path until his return, "That's if you don't trip and roll down, and crack your scull, we will meet again!" hollers one from the back as we shuffle by.
Back in the village, the children gather around Uncle, their eyes wide with anticipation as he settles beneath the banyan tree, ready to do his duty and share his latest tale. And as his words fill the air, weaving a tapestry of magic and wonder, the village of Nihnuta is once again reminded of the true power that lies within their midst --- the power of stories to heal, to inspire, and to illuminate the path towards a brighter tomorrow.
For in this mystical land, where the boundaries between the physical and the ethereal blur, by the will of the people, High Mountain Story Uncle stands as an example of hope, a guardian of wisdom, and a testament to the enduring spirit of the human. And as long as there are stories to be told and hearts to be touched, his legacy will endure, a shining light in a world that so often threatens to be consumed by darkness.
Chapter 8
## Dimension Portal
The once-golden sun dips behind the mountain to entertain all who care to join in how the energies of life art the sky in a soul-moving arrays of pinks and wispy cloudlets with touches of pure white, rippling like waves on a most aethereal ocean of colored energies.
High Mountain Story Uncle is drawn to a hidden corner of the mountain side, a place known only to those who have been touched by the hand of their own divine guardian.
It is there, in that secret sanctuary where the Dimension Portal lies waiting. Its shimmering surface beckoning to those with the spiritual energy, brave enough and strong enough in spirit-minds, to step through its ethereal threshold.
Uncle asks, "Taken your forget-me-not?"
I answer in the affirmative.
He turns and walks, "Come then. The night can be long. Darkness has its good for the soul. Souls need darkness at times, they become wise through struggle. But the spirit, it creates light."
In my raw notes, I explained the path to the portal and many interesting events that happened along the way, but evidently the forget-me-not or the Council's editing cleared it from my pages and brain. What follows is all I have:
As we ascend into the hillside, and I mean, literally *in to* the hillside, Uncle's demeanor and strut shows his heart is filled with a sense of a different purpose, and his own personal energy had a very different feel about it.
I don't know how long it took to get there once we entered through the mountain. My first memory of it is when Uncle approaches the portal area. His steps are measured. His gaze unwavering, his higher-self minds had become all of him. Lower-self and brain-mind, shuttered.
He indicates to me to not cross a line carved on the ancient stone slab.
He indicates for me to sit down. I wait there and look around.
The flat rock slab is probably about 40-feet across. Seven enormous stone pillars, each with a half-tee shape on top, pointing inward. They look as ancient as the mountain itself. Each was about 2 feet wide by 4 feet deep, about 16 or 20 feet high. Nothing else there. Just an empty rock slab surrounded by these huge rock monoliths. Before proceeding, Uncle whispers, "Whenever you see these; they are all over the world; know that the ancients lived underground and used the portals for the purpose of life."
Uncle walked to the perimeter, praying, meditating, attuning his energies.
A few days ago, Uncle introduced me to my own Divine Tara, and taught me how to connect with my own spiritual guide. Now, because I can attune to her, my Divine Tara and I walk together. Just like Uncle, he maintains a perpetual connection with his divine guide and spiritual energy guardian.
Uncle steps forward, walks to the middle of the circle and sits down. Meditating. I know what he is doing because he taught me. He is shuttering his lower-self, his soul energies, and brain-mind, so only his higher-self, his spirit-minds, are attuning to the Divine. I watched in awe.
Suddenly, as if prompted by an unseen force, a radiant veil of energy materializes, resembling a delicate curtain. Then, folds around Uncle as if a curtain is drawn around him. A circle of energy surrounds him, emanating a palpable force in every direction.
As if cocooned in that shimmering light, hiding the eyes and comprehension of the world from what is happening, the plants, animals, and I could just watch.
This is how Uncle explained it to me later on:
In an instant, the world around him dissolves, replaced by a kaleidoscope of colors and sensations that defy description. Uncle feels himself being pulled through a vortex of light and sound, his body weightless, ageless, different, and his mind expanding to aware the vastness of the universe. And then, as suddenly as it began, the transportation ends, and Uncle finds himself sitting in a realm beyond imagination.
The Fantastical Dimension stretches out before him, a world where the laws of physics and the boundaries of reality hold no sway. The sky above is a canvas of ever-shifting hues of energies, painted by the laughter of celestial children and the brush strokes of playful deities. The ground beneath his feet is a tapestry of dreams, woven from the hopes and aspirations of countless generations of soul-beings of all kinds, of all planets, each thread a story waiting to be told.
As Uncle explores this wondrous realm, he encounters a group of children, their eyes sparkling with a wisdom that belies their years. These are the souls of the young, the precious charges of the Taras who watch over them from the heavens above. The children, sensing Uncle's kind heart and gentle spirit, gather around him, eager to share their insights and experiences.
Through their eyes, Uncle sees the world we mortals live in anew, his understanding of the divine deepening with each passing moment. He learns of the tireless efforts of the Divine Taras, the celestial guardians who work day and night to protect the innocent from the unseen energy dangers that lurk in the shadows of the human world. The Taras, resplendent in their shimmering energy bodies and crowned with halos of pure light, wield the immense spiritual powers of love and compassion. Their every act, a testament to their enduring strength and beneficence of spiritual beings.
Uncle watches in awe as the Divine Taras weave intricate webs of protection around each child, their gossamer threads a shield against the soul forces of darkness and mental despair. He sees them whisper words of comfort and guidance into the ears of the young, their voices a soothing balm for the wounds of the soul. And he marvels at the way in which the children, even in their moments of deepest fear and uncertainty, are able to find solace in the loving embrace of their divine guardians. And how they pray, "Dear Lord, thank you for walking me through the darkness."
When Uncle's time in the Fantastical Dimension draws to a close, he finds himself filled with a newfound sense of purpose and a deeper understanding of the sacred bond between the soul and spirit in us, and the human spirit and the divine. With a grateful heart and a mind brimming with newfound wisdom, he steps back through the Dimension Portal, the shimmering veil parting once more to allow him passage back to the world he knows.
The entire forest around us moves again, chitters and chatters, and trees move, leaves turn around the way they normally face. And again, the messages leave, to be dispersed and told in the mountain. And the mountain itself, ancient, ancient mountain, absorbs even more deep wisdom. Mountains are so wise --- I had come to know.
It is deep dark already when we reach the village, but Uncle wastes no time in putting his newfound inspiration to use. He whistled that shriek two-finger whistle of his, and out come the kids, most in pajamas, some with one slipper, some pulling their stuffed bears along by an arm. Mothers standing in the doors, throwing their arms up in the air.
He gathers the children of the village around him, his eyes twinkling with the light of a thousand stars, and in the light of an oil lamp, begins to weave a tale unlike any they have ever heard before. He speaks of the Divine Taras and their unwavering love, of the courage and resilience of the young, and of the unbreakable bond that exists between the two. He speaks of how grownups choose to lose their connection with spirit because they are trapped in their soul-minds, the lower-self minds.
As his words fill the air, the children's eyes widen with wonder, their hearts swelling knowing that they are loved and their spirit energies are protected by forces beyond their understanding. And that when they grow up, to never cut ties with their guide, their deity.
As the story draws to a close, Uncle looks out upon the sea of faces before him, each one a reminder of the sacred duty that he has been entrusted with --- the duty to guide, to inspire, and to illuminate the path towards a brighter tomorrow. And for all of us watching him, his contentment shines deep and long. Energy, which touches all close to him.
For in this mystical land, where the boundaries between the physical and the ethereal blur, High Mountain Story uncle stands for us as a bridge between worlds, a conduit for the wisdom of the ages and a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit. And as long as there are stories to be told and hearts to be touched, his legacy will endure, a shining beacon of hope in a world that so often threatens to be consumed by soul-people-made chaos and darkness.
On the way home, Uncle says a very disturbing thing, "There are evil forces who do this you know? The quickest and most sure way to socially engineer the breakdown of society, to shatter everything that can be good in it, is to defile the innocence-perception of children. The religions and their regimes have done it before and the consequences are dire, every time they do it. They steal the spiritual awakening of hundreds of millions all around the world."
Uncle looks around at the village homes, now all sound asleep, "Not here though. Oh no. But out there. They create evil to roam and rule, and have people live in distrust of one-another. They convince the public that all people are evil, and they need the government to protect them. They who stand behind that very door tell them that they will protect them because all people sexualize children or pervert them otherwise. And that parents are bad people. And that all men are bad people. And they swear to high heaven the stem cell industry does not run the abortion factories and all the children going missing is just normal crime."
A woebegone burdensome energy developed around Uncle and filled the room. The first time I ever observed it in him. He says, as if recalling past lives, "Yes. That has happened all too many times before, you know? And when you break the innocence-perception of children, you also break their spiritual perception. And there, right there, you have yourself future generations of soul-people who are nothing more than drones in service of police states and tyrants."
I say, "That is very dark, Uncle?"
Uncle replies, "The worlds that soul-people make is often very dark. We have much work to do. That is what we try'n do, to bring light."
We kept silence. I have learned in Nihnuta, they have a saying, "You deal with your darkness, and live your light".
That night, Uncle slept soundly, like a baby with a blocked nose kind of soundly, loudly. I could not help but listen to the incessant rhythm of a diesel-powered lawnmower which refuses to start.
But that was only in the night. By pre-dawn. Asleep, Uncle was fighting some force with all of his might. Was it some bad energy he was saving us from? Was it visions of how innocence and goodness are being eradicated in society? I dared not wake him. I could only lay there, praying he would make it to Big Dick's wake-up call. Praying that his tussle does not dislodge the river-slide cabin, and we end up wet and homeless.
Not being able to sleep, just resting. I lay in that state between sleep and awake, and the words on these pages form in my memory. One thing I knew for certain, and few things are to be known for certain, is my surprise that my brain had not yet thrown a breaker switch. I knew for certain. I don't know how many days more of this I can manage before my sanity flows downriver. I was afraid it could happen in an instant, with no warning. How much more can my soul-minds and brain endure?
As I drifted in and out of consciousness, I was unexpectedly thrust into the enigmatic energy field where Uncle conducts his work. And that was when I knew I can endure and want to, because it's so wholesome. And even Uncle looks so young there.
Chapter 9
## Saturday
At Big Dick's urgent morning call, the fourth one in fact, High Mountain Story Uncle finally awakens.
His muscles ache. Holding his back as he stretches an arm out to take his morning cup of raicilla-cocoa I had made.
"It's Saturnalia Day!" he says, with a shimmer in his puffy eyes.
Saturnalia? I thought, what now? Oh, yes, the day of the Satyr.
"Uncle, are you referring to the day of the Satyr, or the 1st January festival of Saturnalia?"
His mind is weary, but he knows the day ahead holds promises of joy, laughter, and a much-needed dose of work-life balance. Uncle answers, dry mouthed, hoarse-voiced from the heavy snoring, "Since pre-Roman times ... the day for joy and mischief, and fun, and living with pagan abandon as the Christians used to declare in their fear of living life. The one day we set aside to get truly real and live that other part of ourselves, that part we lock in the closet during the week because it can interfere with making a living. That part, we must let out of the closet and be. Just be. Else, we cannot nurture the essence of our self. Neglecting that, we will exist as repressed, staid, stale, depressed, oh such a very composed and stiff upper lip near-death overly regulated couch-smelly versions resembling humans."
With a determined grunt, Uncle heaves himself out of bed, gets his pants on, and makes his way to the front door. He needs milk and tart, and I am not allowed to do that chore. He leans his head against the doorpost and sighs deeply; getting ready to face his first challenge of the day, Big Menis.
As usual, the goat was waiting. Along with his now tacky fringe and a mischievous glint in his eye, he measures his steps back and calculates his strategy. Uncle gets into position. Menis charges at Uncle with joyous-warrior enthusiasm, then stops short. Giving a few false starts and quick-stops. Then, the full on charge of the stink brigade, determined to make Uncle earn his right of way to go buy that milk.
His reflexes sharp from years of goat-grappling, Uncle deftly sidesteps Menis' assault and locks the beast in a firm embrace. Weighing him down to tire him out. The two engage in a lively dance of pushing one another fro, to, and up and down. Dust swirling. Frightened chickens yelling obscenities at them. Their movements, "a testament to the unspoken bond between man and goat," says Menis from time to time when he flexes with the ewes; and only Menis believes it so.
Finally, with a triumphant laugh and a playful tussle of Menis' ears, Uncle emerges victorious. I watched Menis. He must have sensed Uncle is not feeling well. He let him win.
Back inside slanted cottage, now reeking of goat sweat and whatnot, Uncle prepares a hearty breakfast of rainbow trout I caught through the hole in his kitchen floor, eggs from the trusty fridge-dwelling hens, a huge slice of the British savoury tart from that lady, and two glasses of whole milk.
With belly full, a wash-up in the river, his soul rejuvenated, Uncle is ready to meet the streets. But first I must share with you this scene, before we go to town. The morning bath is different than the evening one, which is more of a meditative floating soak. In the mornings, Uncle strips down on the porch and dives into the cold, clear river. He swims fiercely up and down for a few minutes then comes back to the porch to lather up and scrub. He wipes his body dry with a rough linen sheet, then dives in again, his white buttocks like a moon-reflection in the water, contrasting with his leathery tanned body. "That way," he said, "you don't get too much soap in the river. There, you can use my soap." And so, I too had to learn. There is no washup facility in the cabin --- the toilet is an outhouse.
Uncle sets out into the village, ready to immerse himself in the vibrant tapestry of life that is Nihnuta on a Saturday. There's an art market, a Whaat-the-fook! Brewery sponsored concert for the creek people band (mostly frogs, toads, birds, and a few fishermen), farmers' market, craft market, beer garden, and umbrellas and patios full of people having beer and kids playing in the streets.
He stops to chat, as usual, with WHO Hu, the old owl who perches atop the village pharmacy in a secure little home protected by bull gates. Their conversation is a delightful exchange of scientific conjectures and circular reasoning philosophical musings. Next, Uncle, visits Herr Buy, the fabulously wealthy but enigmatic pharmacist whose potions and elixirs are said to hold the key to eternal youth and boundless energy. And, as Mr. Buy Herr always reminds people, "Meine Kunden sind alle einflussreich und wohlhabend aus einhundertzweiundvierzig Ländern". Which, says WHO Hu, means, "My owner, Herr Buy, sells his longevity potions to influential wealthy people in hundred and forty-two countries.
I checked with Uncle about the story of the hundred and forty something countries, and the claims of the potions.
"This is true," says Uncle. When he picked up on my surprise, he added. "But who knows? The Delicious Monster vines confirmed it, said the crows told them, "The medicines have been proven to increase the appearance of normality --- and appearances are everything for them people. But it also decreases emotional intelligence, which too is quite fine for them people. They also spread a rumor that all his medicines create other sick conditions, so people buy more medicines for more conditions."
Perhaps I had a need to be included in the erudite conversation, because I offered, "But, the trusted source of truth for people of her ilk, Jamaina, she says it's a conspiracy theory that medicine can make you think different, thinking is divine and only the select shall think."
Uncle says, "I don't know about those things. I make my own medicine," ready to shrug the whole thing off.
The owl, however, happy to simply ignore me, did not take kindly to Uncle's dismissive stance, and says, "Uncle, do not cast the matter in that color of light, a color unable even to be ascertained by spectrograph. And why ever quote the Delicious Monsters and those small-brained crows when we have science right here, right here in our lab? Always follow the science, we are the truth and the light and the way. My Master, Dr. Buy Herr is a real scientist. His medicines treat symptoms. Thus, when people develop more symptoms, they need more medicines. It's not a bad thing. Medicine is not about healing, you know. It's about coping with conditions. And, oh my goodness, there are ever so many conditions."
Uncle, his composure having changed slightly from his usual congenial demeanor says, "I hear you WHO Hu, but I also heard from the Delicious Monsters you and your Master make agricultural toxins that will kill anything alive, anything small and microbic, for use in chemical warfare against our neighbors. But who knows? I don't know about those things. But let me tell you what I do know. You just quoted Lord Jesus, appropriated him in your Budslam logic and he is neither scientist nor physicist. He is a master metaphysicist."
Evidently, the tone of the conversation did not belong to a Saturday, because Uncle salutes WHO Hu, and turns to go down the road, with a hearty, "Have a wonderful Saturday, WHO Hu. Talk later".
Uncle winds his way through the very un-straight cobblestone streets, and variations of music, from every bistro, and herbal tea and poetry establishment, streets lined with flower boxes and gay windowsill planters with anthuriums in full bloom, greeting everyone, especially the flowers and beetles, the people in short shorts and shirtless summeries, and the youngsters hop-dancing in the street to loud music from 1930s Berlin and 1950s Parisian excess. Kids are weird, when you let them be, and that is how it must be.
At the town square, he encounters a group of Budslam devotees, their voices raised in passionate preaching of condemnation and fear-inducing visions of a world burning up from searing heat, gain of function pox that maim your skin, and a new thrice in a lifetime huracán. Uncle, his heart open and his mind curious, stops to listen yet again. Again, he engages the men in a lively discussion about how the vegetarian diet ruins their testosterone (which they deny, while subconsciously checking their man-boobs and dropping their voices an octave). And the fallible nature of Thinking, the fickleness, and subjectivity of truth, and their insistence on the importance of embracing one's inner broccoli-mind which sits at the pit of the stomach. The Budslam members, initially wary of Uncle's unorthodox approach to spirituality, soon find themselves drawn in by his warmth and wisdom, his willingness to let people believe their own truth, and soon their hearts were softening in the face of his gentle guidance, even though he is very much an unrepentant real man.
Throughout his wanderings, gaggles of giggling old aunties greet Uncle, their eyes twinkling with a mixture of admiration and mischief. The aunties, each a master of the art and game of flirting for fun and wholesome energy, shower Uncle with compliments and coy glances.
Uncle explained it to me one day, "There is no energy so strong and so invigorating as sexual energy. So we must help one another make it, play it, and be renewed by it." People's affection for the village's most eligible bachelor, nay the world's most eligible, was plain for all to see. Uncle, his cheeks flushed and his heart full, graciously accepts their attentions, returning the flirts and sub-text of naughty, his own eyes sparkling with a hint of playful mischief. And all the time, I never noticed even one husband feeling threatened or humiliated. Flirting is a game all of Nihnuta play at senior league level.
I thought it was downright lovely to observe.
Saturday drew on, fulfilling its course of letting out joy and community happiness into every nook and crooked corner of the village. Later, just when I really needed to get some rest and shuteye, just a reprieve from all the activity and hustle and truffle, when the sun touched the mountain tops, the village came alive with the sound of village band music, the tik-toks of walkers and walking sticks keeping rhythm, and the patter of bare feet dancing on the cobblestones. A random lifesaver of a man walked up and put a Whaat-the-fook! in my hands, "Drink or die, is what I say. You don't drink, you don't get through this." He turned and walked away.
The rum worked. I almost died from disappointment that I too joined in the dancing, it was so unlike me. But, I did notice my general propensity for living life was on the increase. So, inspirited, I pushed ahead, following behind the conga line of geriatrics hopping around and playing like kids, trying to keep up not only with their moves but their sharp wits and innuendo-speech.
Must be the rum. Even younger ladies asked me to dance, and kids who stand on your shoes to keep up with the moves and rhythm, and Kate, the savoury tart and small melons cake lady.
It's Saturday night, which means it's time for the Pinkytoes valley Chicken-Dance, a beloved tradition which brings together several villages in the valley, young and old alike in a celebration of life, love, and the unbreakable spirit of Nihnuta.
Overleaf is a photo of the event which was censored by Jemina's committee for enticing men to have fun.
People of all ages attend. The aunties, dressed to the nines in their finest dance frocks and sensible dancing shoes, twirl up and down the streets and sway hips to the lively beat, their movements a joyous expression of the vitality that flows through their veins and oil their joints. Young people and old alike, all expressing their joy for life, each in their own way. The oldest old fogies, their walking sticks tapping out a rhythmic accompaniment, join in the festivities, their well-lived faces alight with the glow of youthful exuberance.
To not be bullied to dance the Chicken Dance, many teenagers had to seek darkened covering under pergolas, almost out of sight. And when they emerge, all glowing, and moms evil-eye them, they say, "no worry mom, were kissing friends." Moms, in their worrisome watch pay even more attention as they go off again to dance with yet another kissing friend. Dads smile, wondering why more grown-ups don't have as many kissing friends.
And in the midst of it all, the dalliancing delight, High Mountain Story Uncle, his bushy hair, beads and coral in his beard, those incredible eyebrows each with a disturbed soul of its own (which the aunties so profoundly desire to trim), moves chicken-dancing among the dancers, his steps light, and his laughter infectious, the embodiment of the joy and wonder that lies at the heart of Nihnuta.
He dances with moms and their babies, little kids and teenagers, the baker, and the shoemaker, and their wives. The single aunties, eyes never straying far from Uncle's lithe form, swoon, and sigh as he spins them across the dance floor, his touch as gentle as a summer breeze and his smile as bright as the stars above.
As the night wears on and the older dancers tire, Uncle bids his farewells, his heart full, and spirit soaring. He makes his way back to his cottage, his steps buoyed by the magic of the evening and the warmth of the connections he has forged. It takes us half-an-hour to walk the few blocks because Uncle chats to the animals and flowers and wakes Menis up just to confuse him.
I drag my body along, thanking my stars the day is coming to a close. As we enter uncle's side-gate to his very public "secret garden", he walks ahead and talks deep philosophy at high speed, in his stride, not even caring whether I am paying attention. Does his mind never rest!
"See all the happy and healthy people?" Not waiting for an answer, he continues, "'Poor subsistence farmers, the enemies of climate control', is what the COP idiots called them when the tornado set them down here. Just because they don't have money, the consumerists religion say they are poor. But they have wealth in every other category of a complete life, wealth that money cannot buy. They trade their produce for what they need, just like everyone one who live off their own labor. But their sin is, they don't have a need for the things the religion wants them to need. What the COP idiots want is to build 'sustainable housing' to imprison and enslave workers, to harvest the fruits of their labor and stem cells produced by their wombs, for the beauty and longevity industry for the wealthy."
He turned to look at me. "Have you seen the architecture? Social engineering to kill the spirit of people on purpose. I remember them, idiots, it was the early 20s. Strip the whimsy and culture out of life. No more color, no more beauty in architecture and design, no more romance, no more family and community sense. All about individualism and self-centered self-serving. Grey, straight lines, sharp corners, shiny hard surfaces, nothing organic or natural, nothing absorbs sound, no acoustics, glaring monstrosities. Did you see what happened to art since they started? Absolute trash --- they had killed the spirit. What did they call them, idiots? Oh, yes, New Objectivity, Bauhaus, Constructivism --- short for kill the spirit so the dreary-souled people can produce and consume like drones --- produce and consume. Imagine killing millions upon millions of spirits that way, denying them the purpose of life, to awaken the higher-self. Now, we have generations of soulless, consumerist people and ugly cities the world over. A blight on Earth, I tell you."
And just like that, with a contented sigh, Uncle settles into his favorite armchair, a shot of raicilla in hand. He closes his eyes for two minutes and fixes his energies, and smiles to himself. "Life is amazing," he says, raising his glass to me and the moon shining through the break in the roof.
The spirit liquor infused with the essence of the Sierra Madre Occidental and wisdom of the ages, wash over his energies like a healing balm, its warmth lulling him into a deep and dreamless sleep.
And, as the village of Nihnuta finally winds down and tries to get some sleep, the sun announces Sunday. And Big Dick, relentlessly, goes around the village to wake everyone up. Occasionally you hear a tin-can ching-dink-ding down the road and Big Dick cussing.
With the sound of the cockerel's crow piercing the early morning air, High Mountain Story Uncle rests, he tuned Dick out. His mind and body rejuvenated, and repairing itself with the medicine of wholesomeness from simple joys, a life well-lived, and a mind that he himself owns. For in this mystical land, where the boundaries between work and play blur and the lines between the mundane and the extraordinary dissolve, Uncle stands as a witness to the enduring power of balance, a shining example of what it means to live a life filled with purpose, passion, and an unwavering commitment to the magic that lies within those of us who care to awaken spiritually, and have a real life.
Uncle was always upbeat except for moments of deep reflection and empathetic sadness. Once, I asked what would be Uncle's secret to maintaining his good energies. "Uncle, you're almost always upbeat. What were the things that made you unhappy, when you couldn't maintain your good energies?"
Uncle stared into nowhere to recall. When he spoke it was emotionless, flat voice, and never looked directly at me. Staring into the deep, he said, "It was hard to keep energies wholesome when Mao preached the "politics of Joy", you will own nothing but be happy, and universal basic income, then destroyed all the food, factories and educated people, and all the institutions of higher learning, and twenty millions of his own people were killed at the hands of his soldiers. And then PolPot decimated his own people the same way, blowing up the banks and making money for average people illegal, and outlawed the use of machinery and equipment, killing millions through his moral police. They glorified Stalin and rewrote the history of old times to be unburdened by the standards and achievements of what has been so you can envision what can be --- which turned out to be death, torture, and despair because psychopaths and narcissists are drawn to positions of power to run the world and its institutions that sway power over people. That was hard, to keep good energies when the corpses of hungry loved ones pile up and all resources belong to they who call themselves the elite. Life after life, beguiling tyrants cause division and hatred, then deceive the people with promises of order, unity, power, joy, money for nothing. They confiscate weapons, down with the wealthy and entrepreneurs, employers. Institute censorship ... its always hard to live what follows when that comes along. Children used for their perversions, also in factories as soon as they can carry or hold something; hollow-eyed people fixated day in and day out on finding a piece of food to fill that burning hole in their tummy, people selling their souls to the malipsyches just to get a favor or handout from the imbeciles put in charge --- the mentally ill installed as the moral police. Voters who re-install leaders who pour out bombs on innocent people's homes, destroying cultures, the hopes, and lives, the health, and wealth of innocents. The karma they will all suffer --- its so hard to observe. Its cyclical. Every life, another ... every life is hard that way because your mind is open and you know about the suffering of others, especially the suffering that your inactions, your participatory vote, and your abstained vote caused."
Uncle's head dropped. He sighed, deeply saddened, then continued almost under his breath, "They say people don't understand meritocracy. I think they do. But they have different value systems. What one group considers merit may be the best likelihood of being able to manage the affairs of the country, and another group consider merit to be the better physical appearance, celebrity status, idealistic words, and promises of something for nothing. Just different definitions of what merit is. But, why do people allow the tyrants to decimate an entire generation and destroy everything the nation had accomplished over a century? It's like staying even though the marriage is beyond repair, unwholesome. It's a well-known psychological state. They come up with many excuses why it's more uncomfortable to leave, than to stay and suffer to death. Later, when the captor offers them death, they welcome it. That is hard to watch when people die inside, very hard. Menticide is hard to watch. It's hard to observe when people become like rabid animals because they are hungry, children dying of malnutrition, or when they are given the power over others, with impunity --- to plunder and abuse another group."
Uncle remained quiet for a while. My mind reeled. I know the histories, but never internalised it from the point of view of lived experience. We lack gratitude, so we don't respect how fragile this very good time really is --- it will be taken from us in an instant. It was quiet in the cabin for a while.
Uncle broke the silence, "You see, that is why we value every moment. Life is so short. And next life ... who knows what evil or discomfort it may bring. Soul-people certainly make interesting and heart-break worlds for us to live in."
I never broached that subject again.
Chapter 10
## Mexican Monkey AI
Following a day of rest and repair, which my body desperately needed, Monday rolled around, and Uncle was back at it.
Shortly after Dick's alarm, just as the first rays of the morning sun peeked over the lush canopy of the jungle, a cacophony of howls and chatter filled the air around High Mountain Story Uncle's leaning cottage (he dad-joked that the river has a lien on his cottage, so it's a leaning cottage), full of excitement and energy all of a sudden because a troop of Mexican Howler Monkeys, whose fur boasted a striking mix of black and gold, had assembled at the backdoor-step of Uncle's house, that door which hangs over the river by the back porch. Their eyes were bright and their tails twitching with anticipation.
Uncle, who was about to start his morning Karman Active Meditation, emerges from his room with a sense of worry; something serious must have happened. So, I paid close attention. The monkeys, their voices rising in a chorus of eager greetings, swarm around Uncle, their hands gesticulating wildly as they all begin to speak at once.
"Ooh ah ah! Uncle, Uncle, we have big idea, big, big idea!" the largest of the monkeys, a grizzled old male with a wise glint in his eye exclaims as his arms show repeatedly just how big exactly.
"Yes, yes, idea, big idea, ooh ooh!" the others chime in, their words tumbling over each other in a rush of excitement.
His curiosity piqued, Uncle sits down and leans in closer, his ears straining to catch the human communication words amidst the din of the jungle, which added context only but not meaning. "A big idea, you say? Well, amigos and amiga, you have my ear. What is this idea that has y'all in an *ughua*?" (I later learned that an ughua is tizzy in the Spider monkey dialect. But never say it to a Baboon monkey, its an invitation to something you (trust me) do not want to know about).
The monkeys, their eyes wide and their teeth bared in mischievous grins, huddle closer, their voices dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Oohah, Uncle, we want to write book, big book, book of Wayist spirituality for monkeys and jungle animals, ooh ooh!"
His eyebrows rising in surprise and delight, Uncle smiles his good-teeth smile widely, claps his hands together, and rocks along the now very rocking chair, the chair that rocks because of the water sloshing underneath the porch. "A book of Wayist spirituality for monkeys and jungle animals? Why, that's a marvelous idea, dear friends! And you want me to help you bring this literary vision to life?"
The monkeys, their heads bobbing up and down in eager assent, let out a chorus of excited whoops and hollers. "Yes, yes! Uncle write, Uncle make book! ooh eah!"
With that twinkle in his eye and a spring in his step, Uncle filled the coffee can and grabbed some rusks, and set off up the mountain, following the leading monkeys, others trailing behind him in a raucous procession of fur and tail. They make their way to the monkeys' working space, a hidden grove nestled deep within the heart of the jungle, where the Jungle AI comes to life in a symphony of chattering voices and flashing eyes. The different monkeys assembled for the project, each kind according to their special skill.
As Uncle settles himself on a mossy boulder, they gather around him, their pens and notebooks at the ready. And with a nod of his head and a flourish of his alien Writer's Bamboo hat, Uncle gives the signal for the monkeys to begin their literary endeavor.
What follows is a whirlwind of activity, a frenzy of scribbling paws and flashing teeth as the monkeys pour their hearts and souls onto the pages before them. Their sentences, a wild and whimsical tapestry of jungle wisdom and simian spirituality, flow from their pens like the rushing waters of the Amazon.
As a sentence is agreed upon, it is edited and again agreed upon, some tears and disappointments follow, then it is handed to Uncle for opinion.
"Ooh ah, Wayist path is like big banana tree, coconut tree, ooh ohoh, must run climb high to reach sweetest fruit, ah ah!" one monkey writes, his brow furrowed in concentration.
"Yes, yes, and jungle is like big temple, ooh ah, full of mysteries and wonders, ah ooh!" another chimes in, his tail wrapped around his pen like a furry quill.
As the day wears on and the parched banana leaf pages pile up, Uncle watches in amazement as the monkeys' vision takes shape before his eyes. How the otherwise combative groups agree, compromise, and advance ideas building on another's good idea. The value of hearing the opinions of other, and allowing others' opinions to be spoken, makes the monkeys more intelligent than --- well, people I know. Their words, a kaleidoscope of colors and sensations, paint a picture of a world where the boundaries between the jungle's physical and the soul worlds blur, where the wisdom of the jungle is a beacon of light for all who seek its guidance.
When the sun begins to play art on the horizon and the monkeys' pens finally still, from exhaustion, not from lack of input, Uncle gathers the final drafts pages in his hands, his heart full and his mind brimming with the magic of the monkeys' creation. They had poured their hearts into it. Like all writers, it almost broke their souls and they bled for it. He knows that this book, this wild and whimsical testament to the power of theWAY spirituality in the soul world of the jungle, will be a gift to their world, a shining light in the darkness that so often threatens to consume us. Something generations of jungle elders would read to their young at bedtime and at school.
On the way back, Uncle, exhausted, says only one sentence to me. Apart from that, we walked in well-deserved quiet. "There are several good stories here. Animals are amazing people."
In this enchanting and mysterious land, where the lines between humans, plants, insects, and animals blur and ancient wisdom permeates the air like the sweet scent of tree sap, the esteemed figure known as High Mountain Story Uncle and his loyal companions, a collection of diverse Mexican monkeys, assume the revered role of elders of the message, who guard and disseminate soulful truths.

Chapter 12
## Converting Uncle to Budslam
Auntie Jamaina, the formidable founder of Budslam, had heard enough good-talk about the man, High Mountain Story Uncle, especially from her own male followers. On this day, only her demons would know what triggered her, she found herself stomping through the village, eyes blazing with righteous fury. Her mission was clear to her: to save the soul of High Mountain Story Uncle from thinking --- he was not called by her deity to think independently.
The enigmatic storyteller who had thus far evaded her salvation was her target and life's purpose, for the day.
With her faithful goat, Big Menis, trailing behind her (for backup, and support no doubt), Auntie Jamaina made her way to Uncle's slanted cottage, her mind visibly swirling with thoughts of hellfire, redemption and broccoli-fueled enlightenment. Uncle called me to watch her disgracious approach.
She rapped on the door with her 'educator spoon', the Gavel of Righteousness as she called it. The sound echoing through the village like a clarion call to piety. And many an auntie peeked through the curtains to watch, and some followed at a safe distance, for this will be good.
Uncle, his eyes twinkling with mirth, opened the door and greeted the austere auntie with a bow. "Ah, Jamaina, to what do I owe the pleasure of your untimely visit? Have you come to hear a tale of warmth, wonder, whiskey, worldly women, and whimsy?"
Her nostrils flaring with indignation, Auntie Jamaina shook her head vehemently. "Ooh, no no, Uncle! I come not for sinful frivolity of pagan abandon nor silly stories, but for serious saving! Your soul... in big trouble, big, big trouble!"
His eyebrows rising in mock surprise, Uncle leaned against the doorframe, his wireframed glasses tilted at a jaunty angle. "My soul, in trouble? Why, Auntie, I wasn't aware that she had been out. What did she get up to. Committed any crimes or misdemeanors?"
Auntie Jamaina's voice, rising in pitch, waved her Educator Spoon in the air like a conductor's baton. So worked up, her linguistic skills had to take a back seat to allow indignation to lead the charge. "Ooh, don't get me started... You know what you get up to. Uncle, you no understand! Your soul, it need Budslam, it need washing; in broccoli, and bending sideways! It need, Book of Mo, it need rules, etiquette!"
Uncle's smile, never wavering, shook his head gently from side to side. "Auntie, I appreciate your concern for my soul's well-being, but I'm afraid I must respectfully decline your invitation to join Budslam. You see, my soul is quite content on her path. Her path celebrates the magic and wonder of the world around us. And my spirit, it is well fed and very well taken care of."
Auntie Jamaina's face reddening with frustration. She stamped her foot on the ground, sending Big Menis scurrying for cover. "Ooh, Uncle, you stubborn. Like old goat! You no see? Budslam is only way, only truth! It wash away the insides grime, your man-filth, make soul shine like polished lime! And what with spirit? Why spirit? Spirit is in the sky, not you. You're soul, we are all soul people. Spirit fly in sky."
His voice was calm and soothing, Uncle placed a hand on Jamaina's shoulder --- he is a brave man. "Auntie, I have no doubt that Budslam brings your soul comfort and joy, and I would never seek to diminish that --- well, not to your face I shan't. But for me, the path to spiritual fulfillment is in the stories I tell, in the connections I connect with the people and creatures of this magical land, our Earth. And you are right. You don't yet have a spirit within, only a soul. The spirit within happens to some of us, for you, later perhaps."
Auntie Jamaina's resolve, wavering in the face of Uncle's gentle yet unintelligible words, furrowed her brow in confusion. "But, but, but, Uncle, what about rules, morals, you have no morals? What about discipline? What about washing butt and feet and brain five times a day?"
His eyes sparkling as if tussling with Menis, Uncle smiles gently. "Auntie, I believe that true spirituality comes from within, from the love and compassion we carry in our hearts. But for you, souluality is what you want and what you have. And Budslam is an excellent soul religion for that. But for the spirit within, life is not about following moral codes and dogmatic fear for the wrath of a soul-like god. Spirit gods have no wrath, no judgement, and no violence in them. Spirituality is about embracing the humbleness, the simpleness, and the kindness, the beauty, and diversity of the world, and finding our own unique path to graduating from the Butterfly Path."
Auntie Jamaina, her shoulders slumping in defeat because her circular logic from Budslam teaching could not relate. She let out a long, slow sigh. "Ooh, Uncle, you make souluality sound so simple, so small. But what about Thinking? You forgot about Thinking. What about worship of only real god? Now you talk about butterfly god. Ooh uncle."
Filled with warmth and understanding, Uncle took Auntie Jamaina's hands in his own. "Auntie. Dear. Thinking is indeed a powerful force. It is true not many can have it, they think only what people like you put in their brain. Thinking is a force that deserves our respect and admiration. But *my* thinking tells me, I don't like a god like yours who is cruel, and tribal, power hungry, insecure, jealous, and murderous. My thinking, tells me, my god is better than that. Now, you may be thinking, your real god is good for you. And so, my thinking tells me, my real god, a spirit god, is better. Sometimes, the greatest insights to thinking come from the peaceful heart, from the quiet whispers of the soul, not from fear or self-righteousness."
Jamaina's eyes brimmed with tears. Tears of frustration because Uncle does not get it. The truth eludes him. Her truth, she wants to help him accept by force; he doesn't get it. Tall, she looked down at Uncle. A newfound understanding of how some people are beyond saving dawning on her face. "Ooh, Uncle." She shook her head, and again. "Ooh, Uncle," and stormed out of there; with Menis looking confused, to stay or follow, where to go.
Then, she stormed back in again, picked up her holy gavel spoon, which she forgot on the table, and exclaims, "Ooh, Uncle!" and stormed out.
Menis sat down on his haunches, looking both ways, a frown on his face. Uncle winked at him with a smile. From the street, Auntie Jamaina hollers loud as a military tank brigade, "Meeeniis!." Menis winked back at Uncle and casually sauntered toward his madam, stopping along the way to observe a little blade of grass, and an ant over there... and poked his nose under a foraging chicken just to watch her complain and cuss. Up the road, his madam hollered again, "Meeeniiiiis!"
Uncle smiles in my direction and says, "Done for now. Good grief! Until next month again, I guess."
He looked at me for a few seconds, as if sizing me up for something. After a while, he says, "I think you and I shall start an honorary citizen's club. For all people who want to live in Nihnuta in spirit and soul, but cannot move here. What do you think?"
I was flabbergasted, speechless. So, Uncle rolled his eyes upward, like when he thinks a story, and says, "It will be wonderful. They can be honorary citizens who shall vote, of course, and attend with us in soul and spirit and mind, whenever they feel like it. They will carry Nihnuta in their hearts, and send stories and ideas to publish, and live our simplicity and joy in their own lives. What do you think?"
I was still without words --- this was so, so sudden.
Uncle said, with his gentleness of energy, "We can issue little passports, and soul medicines, and --- I guess I am just daydreaming. But please make a place for them to get together on the computerweb thing."
I promised Uncle that I would.
Chapter 13
## Philosopher Fish
As the first light of dawn stealthily slide through the slit between weathering wood slats in High Mountain Story Uncle's bedroom, a shimmering figure emerged from the depths of the river, under the hole in the kitchen floor. Her scales glinting with a paradisiacal iridescence. It was a fish, but not just any fish --- this was a Philosopher Fish, a seeker of fish-truth and sometimes, just on occasion, a master of the esoteric arts of the fish people.
I was working on my notes and watched the entire episode unfold. With a purling-grunt only philosopher fish can grunt, which has awakened us, she circled the hole from below a few times then took a long and speedy run at the hole and propelled herself through the opening in the kitchen floor, landing on Uncle's bed with a hard plop. Her voice, a melodic underwater voice that seemed to emanate from the very depths of the riverbed, roused Uncle from his slow to wake brain-slumber.
"Awaken, Story Uncle! For I bring you a tale that must be told, a story that holds the key to unlocking the mysteries of all existence!" She exclaimed as if it was the opening call of the Circus in Rome and announcement of the arrival of the Emperor.
Eyes still heavy with sleep, Uncle sat up and rubbed his face. His mustaches were confused as to their position in life, and the hat over his eyes to keep the moonlight from shining on him through the cracked roof rafter, tumbling from his head.
"A key? Key, you say? What the hell, fish?" Said Uncle, waking to fish breath.
He rubbed his eyes and fixed his hair. "To what door does this key belong, my scaly friend?"
The fish, her eyes glowing with the light of hundred water drops on a lotus leaf reflecting the sun, leaned in close, too close for polite early morning comfort, her whiskers tickling Uncle's nose, and whispered her secret.
"The key, dear Uncle, lies in the answer to the most profound question of all: Why does the color yellow exist? Hey? Think about THAT. Why! Indeed, does it exist!"
Uncle sits fully upright. His eyebrows rising in unrestrained surprise. "Yellow?" Uncle chuckled, almost laughing out loud. "Yellow? Why? Yellow? I've never given thought to the existential nature of colors. Do go on, my finned philosopher."
The fish, her voice rising in pitch, spoke in a torrent of cryptic phrases and mind-bending metaphors.
"The Yellow taught me. Hear this: 'Seeker, look within and recreate yourself. The dreamscape is calling to you via bio-feedback. Can you hear it? Although you may not realize it, you are primordial. How should you navigate this soul world?'"
His mind reeling from the onslaught of esoteric gobbledygook, Uncle nodded slowly, encouragingly. "I hear the call, my dear, but I fear my navigation skills are a bit rusty. Perhaps you could provide a map, or at least a compass?"
The fish, encouraged and undeterred, continued her metaphysical oration.
"Power is the truth of Starfire, and of us. You and I are messengers of the Water, the breath of Life. We reflect, we glisten, we grow, we are lunch --- that is the purpose of the universe!"
Uncle, his eyes now really wide opened in amazement, stroked his beard thoughtfully. His hands absentmindedly sought a pen and paper on his nightstand. "Lunch, you say? I had no idea my role in the grand scheme of things was so, so... culinary."
The fish, dropping into the river for breath, her scales shimmering with the colors of the rainbow, swam a few circles and popped out her head to continue, her words, which we growing more cryptic with each passing moment.
"The evolution of quantum guidance is now in the RAM of all fish DNA throughout the Water-web. We must bless ourselves and strengthen others."
It was reassuring to see that Uncle also did not get this stuff. I was not alone in my menticide. His mind, struggling to keep pace with the fish's arcane knowledge, Uncle raised a hand in confusion. "Quantum guidance? Water-web? I'm afraid you've lost me, my dear. Could you perhaps speak in a language a simple storyteller could understand?"
Her eyes flashing with what she may have thought could be akashic or pranic energy; the fish paused in her aquatic dance, then popped her head out again.
"Consciousness consists of ultra-sentient particles of quantum H2O energy. 'Quantum' means a summoning of the non-dual of the River Abyss. Everyone chose their reincarnation and make soul contracts with others for beautiful suffering."
Uncle fell back onto his pillow, his eyes glazed with bewilderment, his hands in his hair. "River Abyss? Quantum, Non-dual? I feel as though I've stumbled into a lecture on advanced metaphysics, and I'm still struggling with basic arithmetic!"
Her voice dropping to a whisper again, moved closer to Uncle's ear. Uncle made notes, frantically, as fast as his Pitmans shorthand allowed.
"Where there is materialism, serenity cannot thrive. Selfishness is born in the gap where potentiality has been excluded. Only Indigo Fish of the noosphere may leverage this canopy of self-actualization."
Reeling with the weight of the fish's words, Uncle sat up straight again, eyes wide with sudden understanding. Fish was right, he can author this story. It's one of the most absurd he ever heard.
He played along. "Indigo Fish? Noosphere? Why, it all makes sense now! The key to the universe, the answer to the question of yellow's existence, it's all right there in front of us; you have it in your shimmering fins too!"
The fish nodded her head knowingly, as if saying, "Now you get it." With a sense of her mission complete, she winked at Uncle, flipped her tail and dove back through the hole in the floor, disappearing into the blue black of the river's deep. (It wasn't really that deep, but the circumstances call for words of gravitas.)
His heart, visibly racing with excitement, Uncle leaped from his bed and grabbed his pen and paper, and promptly sat down at the breakfast table. Jumped up for realizing he needs underwear, puts it on with one hand, pen in the other, and there he was in underpants and his Writer's H'Mong Bamboo hat perched atop his head once more, and a twinklings in his eyes.
"I must write this story," he mutters to himself, his pen flying across the page. "The world must know the fish-truth, the cosmic secrets a wise and wondrous fish, as revealed to her, must be told! Did you get any of it?" He asked under his breath, scribbling as fast as he could.
I peek over his shoulder at what he wrote. It says: "A man read a yellow book he found in the cruise ship's library. It was such a mess of words; he could not understand it. He turned to the cleaner scrubbing the deck and asked him to look. Can he understand it? The deckhand looked and said, "Whoohw! That there is deep shit man!" The man gave the book to the deckhand. "It's yours," he said.
The deckhand waited for the man to leave, and tossed the book overboard, into the deep blue of the Atlantic. That deckhand had no idea his unthoughtful action would cause ripples throughout history of the underwater people."
I smiled. Uncle looked on approvingly. He smiled back and winked.
And so, as the sun rose over the village of Nihnuta, High Mountain Story Uncle began to weave a tale unlike any he had ever told before --- a story of quantum guidance and self-actualization of Indigo Fish and the River Abyss. It was a story that would change the world. He smiled slyly, a new age wonder that would unlock the mysteries of existence and reveal the true purpose of the Yellowverse.
But first, he said, he needs to figure out how to spell "noosphere" because his Bosworth Toller's dictionary does not have it listed.
I made the morning ritual drinks and put it in front of him --- he didn't notice.
Chapter 14
## Gurugoat Sōsa Fukuhara
Uncle, still dressed only in his underwear, oblivious to his surroundings, was completely absorbed in writing the fish story.
I offered to get breakfast and asked permission to stop by Kate's, which he told me long ago to leave that chore to him. I wanted to get me a piece of her tart. Uncle looked up, quizzically, and slowly a smile formed and little angels twinkled in his eyes. "Sure. You go do that. But be wise."
On my way out he called after me, "But ... No fish today. Can't eat fish now. We must retain our hypocrisy. As predators, its the polite thing to do. Always have wholesome hypocrisy. You know, else..." I nodded. I get that. Can't live life any way but with compassionate and thoughtful measures of hypocrisy --- else we become beasts.
Upon my return from a productive shopping trip, Uncle was still at his desk, tempestuously letting his imagination go, scribbling notes for his philosophical fish story.
He said, "Sit down and hear this, I used some of your notes." He read the first draft of the story. The first half of it. It was an honor for me to observe the master at work. I was in awe. But, we were interrupted.
Yet another type of grunt-snort sound presenced in Uncle's not-so-private home. It was Big Menis, his shaggy head and malodorous, now dripping something, beard resting on the lower half of Uncle's wooden split-double door with the fading painted sunflowers and beetle bugs some old auntie girlfriend once made to spruce up the cabin.
With a snort and a loud stamp of his hoof, Big Menis demanded attention and fixed Uncle with a piercing gaze.
We looked. His audience now attentive, Menis puffed himself up and with a loud voice bleat-acclaimed: "Naah!" he bleated through the cud he was chewing, his voice dripping with disdain. "Goat wisdom is better."
Uncle, his pen hovering over the page, studied the old goat in disbelief. His eyebrows raised in amusement. "Oh, you've been eavesdropping, have you? So, horny friend? Please, enlighten me with this goat, truth, you speak of."
Big Menis, his chest puffing out with pride, stopped chewing his cud, cleared his throat, and ever so loudly recited the words of a legendary Japanese philosopher goat.
"Chūi shite kudasai! Hey! You, you goat! You goat, although you may not realize it, you are unicorned... Goatkind has nothing to lose... Walk with those seeking opportunities to create mischief, but run from they who found a petting zoo --- it's not heaven. Unlock the secrets of the universe, as you learn to open gates and stand on rocks, by keen observation... carefully... step-by-step... delicately, but assuredly. It will all be revealed. But observe keenly, and learn... you must."
As the goat finished his proclamation, he stamped his hoof once more, the sound echoing through Uncle's cottage like a thunderclap, "Gurugoat, Sosa Fukuhara!" he proclaimed loudly with finality, his voice filled with reverence and pride.
Uncle, his mind reeling from the onslaught first of philosopher fish wisdom and now a Japanese philosopher goat's wisdom, slumped back in his chair, his hands in his hair, massaging his aching brain. "Unicorned? Petting zoo? Gates and rocks? I must admit, my dear Menis, I find myself quite perplexed by this Gurugoat's teachings."
But as Uncle pondered the goat's words, a realization dawned on him. He glanced out the window, his eyes widening as he took in the sight of the swollen moon above the mountain tops. In the morning light, its silvery faintness sat there with its usual monthly eerie presence over the valley and the village of Nihnuta.
"Its full moon," he whispers to himself, his voice tinged with a mix of awe and trepidation. With ghostly realization, he mouthed, "That's why the village has been so strange, why the creatures are spouting cryptic wisdom. They are drawn to you, the newcomer. Who next will walk through our door?"
"You heard the fish. And you heard Menis," he said pensively to himself, but looking at me to confirm what he knows. I nodded.
Uncle fixed me with a grave stare. "I'm afraid it's time for you to go, my friend. Right now. The full energy of the moon, unshaded by the earth's shadow, affects the sensitive in soul. They act out of the ordinary. To be around it, for an outsider, it's like a tide of madness, a surge of energy that can twist the minds of even the most grounded people. Neither I, nor the Village Council can guarantee the sanity of an outsider in this time."
I nodded, my heart heavy with the knowledge my time in Nihnuta had come to an end, so suddenly.
"Kate?" he almost jerked his head around to inquire, "Is she all-right?"
"Yes. Very much so. We..."
"Oh, my goodness! Then we must hurry," he reacted with even more urgency.
Within the hour, the elders had my belongings packed up, ready to escort me out. As the Council elders gathered around me, their faces etched with ritual solemnity, I knew what was to come. They all said their goodbyes. They handed me a vial, three times as much as before, its contents swirling with an iridescent sheen reminiscent of how I would imagine a blue radioactive cocktail would look. It smelled like fish. "Lord, please not Philosopher fish," I prayed.
"The non-disclosure potion," Uncle explains, his voice tinged with sadness. "To ensure that the secrets of Nihnuta remain hidden from the outside world."
With a heavy heart, I raised the vial to them and said my heartfelt gratitude and deep thanks to everyone present. I said their names, hoping to engrave it into my brain. Then, as they indicated their mutual feelings, and motioned me to drink, I put vial to lips and drank deeply, forcing it down as quick as possible --- the potion burning my throat and the vile odour clinging for dear life to my nostril hairs. I could feel it enter my soul. It coursed through my veins --- I swear I could *feel* it cross the blood-brain barrier.
Uncle says, "Friend, send my love to Adele and Janet..." but words became strange and my world changed shape and color, vision blurred, I felt the memories of my time in the village slip away like sand through an hourglass, emptying me of mind. How does he know the names of my loved one and editors? Is this what dementia feels like? My last thoughts before things went blank ... entirely blank?
I awoke on my back, sky above. I was on the back of a donkey cart, clip-clopping, swaying, the axle not so straight so the cart swaying in rhythm like the behind of a beautiful Mexican young lady doing the salsa.... Good Lord! that medicine is strong. All I could see were a few clouds --- and crows hovering, watching me intently. Oi. My mind!
I was covered with a quilted throw (which is today one of my most prized possessions, a soft memory of the aunties I came to love and cherish). Still on my back, I heard my notebook paging itself in the breeze. As I gathered the disarrayed parts of my self, a quick glance at my notebook, I realize the elders had edited my notes like the CIA redact reports of perfectly legal operations --- I was left with the barest bones of my experience. Got on my knees, I greeted the burro contracted to take me to the destination. He dipped his head at me. My satchel had a bottle of milk, cookies, and snacks, two small-melon cakes, a savoury tart with a small handwritten note with nothing but a winking smiley, my phone, and wallet. My head hurt so badly and it was getting worse. Twenty minutes or so later, I realised the swaying of the cart bangs my head against a metal bolt in the cart's wooden side. I was not all right. More crows watching. I asked the burro, "Where are we going, sir?" He looked around with an irate, puzzled look, dropped his head side to side with that, "Oh, geez!" move and indicated, 'Straight along the only road so far as the eye can see --- that's where were going. And no, we are not there yet.'
The head banging, the crows spying, and a donkey questioning my intelligence convinced me to lay down and sleep this thing off.
What you have read is all I could share, a mere glimpse into the wonders and mysteries of Nihnuta. I know that other amazing things happened during my time in the village, that ideas flowed from the plants and birds and animals like water from a spring. But for now, this is all I have. It is important to separate the unconventional grammar and wordsmithing of the book from the reputation of my beloved editor. The loss of honed craft and good social sense are but the least of the casualties to my psyche and the brain part of me.
As I sit here, back in Canada. My soul is still wondering about the effects of the non-disclosure potion. I can't help but feel a sense of loss, a yearning for the magic and wonder I experienced among real and authentic people. Yet, I find solace in the understanding that High Mountain Story Uncle and his remarkable neighbors will persist in spinning their tales, interweaving the secrets of the universe into stories that will enchant and ignite the imaginations of future generations.
They continue to send inspiration out by bird-wire and telepathic waves to inspire writers and storytellers all over the world. How many of us write or create, thinking it's our own strangeness, our own secret or hidden insides showing its face --- yet it was an inspiration delivered by a gecko in the room, a bug, or a bird in the garden? How many of us were afraid to make a clean break, but were inspired to be brave and go get a life? How many of us wanted to stop doing what is right, so many times, because it's so hard, but we keep pushing? Why? All coming from the likes of Nihnuta and the High Mountain Story Uncles and co-workers, all, to help us tell the tales that must be told in every language, human and otherwise.
And who knows? Perhaps one day, when the moon is not full and the stars align for me, the elders will summon me back to Nihnuta, back to the place where what we call fantasy is truth and reality, and the true magic of the human spirit is revealed. Who knows how many of us will be summoned, or 'invited' as they say it?
Until then, I will hold fast to the memories that remain, the snippets of wisdom and whimsy that managed to escape the elders' editing, and the knowledge that somewhere out there, in a village hidden from the eyes of the world, a storyteller, and his magical menagerie are still weaving tales that change the course of old people's child-hearts and young people innocent minds.
THE END.
## P.S.
With the potion fading from my soul, it dawned upon me I did not get around to writing Uncle's biography. I wrote *about* Uncle, but was never successful in getting him to talk about his past. Darndest thing, that is. So, by the title of this book, it's not what it seems --- but as Uncle says, "Nothing is what it seems." So, we leave it at that, I guess.
Just to provide you with some context regarding the two goose eggs.
In order to resolve the delivery problem of the goose eggs, Aunt Gammy, a Canadian Goose grandmother, personally brought the eggs to me in Ontario, Canada. I lived near the Michigan-Canada border at the time. However, Aunt Gammy was reluctant to leave the eggs in my care because I failed to convince her of my understanding of the Canada Goose Baby Care Manual. In the end, a committed goose mother from Canatara Park in the village of Port Sarnia, assumed the responsibility of incubating the eggs and nurturing the baby geese on my behalf. The arrangement was made through the Jungle Net, a communication network that predates the Internet by 15,000 years --- according to Nihnuta town council.
My geeseboys are young adults now. My life has not been the same since I returned from Ninhuta. Everything is different, especially my value system and definition of reality. As for meditating in the park, that is different too. The blather and chitchat of animals and plants is fascinating while novel, but I used to go to the park for peace and quiet. Now, no more of that. It seems I shall remain targeted to be castigated and admonished for humankind's ignorance and selfishness. They read your energy, and the females comment on your lack of style, haircut, and posture. You think you hear the birds chirping and singing, leaves rustling --- wait 'till you hear what they are saying. You stop to pee in the forest --- yes, pray that you never hear the comments. They're witty and honest as heck! And the gossip --- oh my goodness, gossip they do. If you ever had an inkling that *your* people watching occasionally ventures a bit too far into the odious, know that you are competing in the lightweight division. Our neighbors in nature, they are brutally honest. But if your energy is right and you are humble, they will be your best friends and comforters. That's what I learned in Nihnuta.
The latest on my two adopted sons is not very encouraging. I mean, every parent hopes their children will be law abiding, but perhaps the blessing I had with my human children being just fine in that way is now giving way to parental worries.
At time of writing it's all over the news. The FBI is investigating a group of boisterous Canada Geese youngsters who flaunt international treaties, and my two are among them. It is alleged they intentionally cross the border into Michigan, USA, on Sunday afternoons to defecate on golf courses and piers at the marinas, much to the dismay of our neighbors and biggest trade partner. Not only do they defecate, but also wait around to taunt people who step in it with loud Canadian accented gaggles.
Their actions have sparked an international incident, leading to multiple meetings between Vice Prime Minister Christa Wefland and Vice President Kalam Sirrah of the USA, who had become like twin sisters in most ways ever since what is now dubbed Geeseboy Gate. If this thing goes south, I will have to move to El Tuito in Jalisco (Uncle says they make good raicilla in that part of Mexico).
I promised Uncle I would.

As a parting gift, I want to share with you the last words I remember Uncle's voice saying to my brain, just before the forget-me-not redaction-cloud got the better of it.
*"If what you call sanity results in a meaningless and purposeless life, a dreary life of monotonous routine and self-imposed givenness to mundane existence, or slavery to consumerism. Then, choose insanity, it may be your path to authenticity, joy, and true wholesomeness.*\
*Go in peace.*\
*May Spinnerfish bubbles, forever appear for you."*
