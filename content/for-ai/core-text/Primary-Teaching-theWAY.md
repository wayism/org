## Opening
In your hands rests a treasure trove of ancient wisdom, a compendium of teachings that span millennia and traverse the globe. This work, meticulously compiled and thoughtfully presented, offers a glimpse into the profound spiritual insights that have guided seekers on the path of transformation since time immemorial. In keeping with tradition, we write theWAY for the Teaching, and The Way for the divine concept within which our universe exist.
I, Salvar Dàosenglu, speak not as an individual but as the voice of a collective---a dedicated team of scholars, practitioners, and translators hailing from diverse corners of our world. For decades, we have labored across continents and cultures, driven by a shared passion to bring these timeless teachings into the English language. Our journey has been one of discovery, challenge, and profound reverence for the wisdom we have encountered.
Yet, dear reader, we must emphasize a crucial truth: the knowledge contained within these pages is not essential for walking theWAY. Every human, by virtue of their existence, already possesses all they need to embark upon and accomplish the sacred quest of evolving their soul. The purpose of this compilation is not to add burden to your journey, but to illuminate the path that already lies within you.
While this material may serve scholarly pursuits, its true value lies in its potential to aid future cognitive Wayists. It stands as a resource, a wellspring from which teachers and seekers alike may draw to explicate these profound teachings in formats accessible to diverse audiences. Moreover, it provides a foundation for future translations, ensuring that this wisdom may continue to transcend linguistic and cultural boundaries.
It is crucial to note that no single collection of teachings can ever fully encompass the entirety of theWAY. The chapters within this book have been carefully selected to touch upon key aspects of the teaching, and we are confident that all fundamental principles are presented herein. The core teachings of theWAY are few in number, characterized by their simplicity and humility. While this volume contains these essential teachings, it also includes philosophical reflections from ancient traditions that illuminate and expand upon these core concepts.
We acknowledge and honor the myriad other teachings that exist, each offering unique perspectives and applications of these key and timeless truths. Many have been delivered through beautiful books and poetic expressions that deeply touch people's lives. We encourage readers to explore the works of great teachers, such as Rumi, Lalleswari, Janabai, Kabir, and Mirabai, among others. Their wisdom complements and enriches the understanding presented here, offering diverse pathways to embody the principles of theWAY in daily life.
As you delve into these pages, remember that you are not encountering mere words, but echoes of the eternal. Let this book be not a dictate, but a dialogue---an invitation to explore the depths of your own being and to recognize the divine spark that resides within.
May this work serve as a humble tribute to the countless souls who have walked this path before us, and as a beacon of light for those who are yet to come. With deepest gratitude and in service to theWAY, we offer you this compilation of timeless wisdom.
Within these pages, you will find a comprehensive exploration of Wayist spirituality, its core principles, and practices. The book delves into fundamental concepts such as the nature of existence, the purpose of life, and the journey of spiritual evolution known as the Butterfly Path. It elucidates the Wayist understanding of the soul, spirit, and the divine, offering insights into the process of spiritual rebirth and transformation.
Readers can expect to encounter:
\- In-depth discussions of Wayist cosmology and ontology.
\- Practical guidance on the mystical path, meditation, prayer, and energy work.
\- Explorations of key Wayist concepts such as karma, dharma, and free will.
\- Insights into the role of Divine Taras and the nature of Sukhavati heaven.
\- Reflections on ethical living and the application of Wayist principles in daily life.
This book serves as both an introduction for newcomers and a deepening of understanding for long-time practitioners. It aims to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and contemporary life, offering a path of spiritual growth that is both profound and practical.
As you journey through these teachings, may you find not only knowledge, but also inspiration for your own spiritual quest. May these words resonate with the wisdom that already resides within you, illuminating the Way that leads to true understanding and lasting peace.

## PART I
### ABOUT THE PATH
In this section, we explore the fundamental teachings about the nature of the Path, the Purpose and Meaning of life. We understand our place in the world and why the world is sometimes a dystopian reality that seems far removed from spiritual principles.
1
## The Purpose of Life
The purpose of human life is evolution - the soul's journey to become spirit, the caterpillar's transformation into the butterfly.
2 Earth is our school of divinity for souls, each lifetime a classroom, every experience a lesson in the curriculum of cosmic wisdom.
3 We are here to learn, to grow, to transmute the base metal of ego into the gold of spiritual awareness and identity as the beneficent, wise, humble, deity we are becoming.
4 The soul reincarnates countless times, gathering wisdom through myriad experiences, both joyful and sorrowful.
5 Our task is to awaken to our spiritual potential, to recognize the divine spark within and nurture it into full flame.
6 We are called to transcend the limitations of our animal nature, to cultivate virtues that reflect our highest potential.
7 The purpose of life is not mere survival, nor accumulation of wealth, nor pursuit of fleeting pleasures.
8 Through this process, we gradually shed the illusions of separateness and realize our oneness with all creation and neighbourliness with all living beings.
9 The ultimate goal is graduation from the school of Earth, to be reborn as immortal spiritual beings in the higher realms.
10 Yet even this exalted state is not the end, but a new beginning - for the journey of spiritual evolution is eternal.
11 Let the Wayist embrace this noble purpose, living each day as an opportunity for growth, service, and awakening to our divine destiny.
The purpose of life for the soul is evolution\
To metamorphose into heaven\
is our destination
For the soul, life on Earth is the school\
Time after time, it will return\
Death is for the body, not for the soul.\
Learning to become a spirit, in heaven to be born
The soul learning humility, simplicity, compassion\
and of the divine in the infinitesimal\
Newborn spirits start immortality in heaven
So much to do, so many worlds to see\
Active, busy lives await them\
Amazing beauty, out there in our galaxy

## Butterfly Path
### A Journey of Spiritual Metamorphosis
Hearken, O seeker of truth, to the ancient wisdom of the Butterfly Path. As the caterpillar transforms into the butterfly, so too does the human soul evolve into a divine spirit.
2 In the beginning, the soul dwells in ignorance, crawling upon the earth like a caterpillar.\
It knows not of its divine nature, consumed by worldly desires and attachments.
3 Yet within this lowly creature lies the seed of greatness, a spark of the divine waiting to be awakened.
4 Through countless lives, the soul feeds upon experiences, growing in wisdom and understanding.\
It learns the ways of love, compassion, and selflessness.
5 When the time is ripe, the soul enters the chrysalis of spiritual awakening.\
In this sacred cocoon, it undergoes a profound transformation.
6 The old self dissolves, its limited identity melting away.\
In the darkness of introspection and self-craft, a new being takes shape.
7 This is a time of great challenge and mystery.\
The soul must surrender all it once knew, replaced by wisdom, trusting in the unseen process of rebirth.
8 As the butterfly emerges from its chrysalis, so too does the enlightened spirit break free from the confines of the mortal soul.
9 Behold! The once-earthbound creature now soars on wings of light, its true nature revealed in all its glory.
10 This divine spirit, born of human experience yet transcending it, takes its place among the immortals in the celestial realms.
11 Yet its journey is not complete, for it has vowed to guide others along the Butterfly Path.\
As a beacon of hope, it returns to earth, inspiring souls to embrace their own transformation.
12 Know this, O seeker: You too are on this sacred journey. Your struggles and triumphs are the very stuff of your metamorphosis.
13 Embrace each stage of the path with courage and faith.\
For in the fullness of time, you shall spread your wings and take flight, ascending to your forever home in the divine light.
14 This is the way of the Butterfly Path, the journey from ignorance to enlightenment, from mortality to immortality.\
May all beings awaken to this truth and find liberation.

## Hybrid Beings
### The Unique Nature of Human Existence
In the vast web of existence, humans occupy a unique and precarious position. We are hybrid beings, a remarkable fusion of soul and nascent spirit, incarnated in a physical form. This hybridization is both our greatest strength and our most profound vulnerability, setting us apart in the cosmic order and necessitating special care and guidance as we navigate the Butterfly Path.
The human soul, unlike that of other creatures, possesses an unprecedented degree of free will. This expanded capacity for choice and self-determination is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows for rapid spiritual growth and the potential for profound transformation. On the other, it exposes the soul to greater risks, making it potentially dangerous both to itself and to others. The power to choose, when coupled with ignorance or misguided intent, can lead to actions that generate significant karmic consequences or impede spiritual progress.
Simultaneously, within each human resides a fledgling spirit - not yet fully developed, but awakening to its potential. This embryonic spirit is a spark of the divine, a promise of our future existence as pure spiritual beings. However, in its current state, it is fragile and vulnerable, like a seedling pushing through the soil towards the light.
This unique configuration - a soul with expanded free will and a nascent spirit - creates a being of immense potential but also great vulnerability. We are, in essence, spiritual toddlers venturing into realms far beyond our full comprehension or control. Just as a young child might reach for objects beyond its understanding or capability, our hybrid nature allows us to touch upon spiritual realities that we are not yet fully equipped to handle.
It is in this context that the role of our Divine Tara becomes not just beneficial, but absolutely essential. Our Divine Tara serves as a spiritual guardian and guide, akin to a loving parent watching over a curious and adventurous toddler. When we engage in spiritual practices, especially those involving mystiception or energy work, it is our Divine Tara who holds our hand, ensuring that we do not stray into dangerous territory or hurt ourselves in our explorations.
The Divine Tara's guidance is particularly crucial as we begin to venture into spiritual realms. Like a child being gradually introduced to the complexities of the adult world, we are allowed to experience and interact with higher spiritual energies and states of consciousness, but always under the watchful eye of our divine protector. This supervision is not a limitation, but a safeguard that allows us to grow and learn at a pace that is both challenging and safe.
Our hybrid nature also makes us potentially vulnerable to ethereal predators or malevolent energies that might seek to exploit our unique position. Just as a young animal might be more susceptible to predators, our nascent spiritual nature combined with our powerful but sometimes misguided free will could make us targets for entities that would seek to mislead or harm us. It is the constant vigilance and protection of our Divine Tara that shields us from such interference, creating a safe space for our spiritual evolution.
This vulnerability underscores the absolute necessity of walking the Butterfly Path under the tutelage and guardianship of our Divine Tara. We simply cannot navigate this journey safely or effectively on our own. The complexities of spiritual growth, the pitfalls of misused free will, and the dangers of premature or unsupervised spiritual experiences are too great for us to face alone.
Yet, it is precisely this hybrid nature, with all its vulnerabilities and potential, that makes the human experience so valuable in the cosmic scheme. We are beings in transition, evolving from soul entities into spiritual beings. This journey, fraught with challenges and illuminated by moments of profound insight, is the very essence of the Butterfly Path.
As hybrid beings, we must cultivate a deep awareness of our unique nature. We must recognize both our potential and our limitations, approaching our spiritual journey with humility, curiosity, and a willingness to be guided. We must learn to balance the expansive free will of our souls with the wisdom to seek and heed the guidance of our Divine Tara.
In practical terms, this means:
1 Cultivating a close relationship with our Divine Tara through regular prayer, meditation, and mystiception.
2 Approaching spiritual practices with reverence and caution, always seeking the guidance of our Divine Tara before venturing into new spiritual territories.
3 Developing discernment to recognize the difference between genuine spiritual guidance and potentially misleading influences.
4 Practicing humility, acknowledging our status as spiritual learners rather than masters.
5 Embracing our role as hybrid beings, recognizing that our current state is a crucial phase in our larger spiritual evolution.
6 Being patient with our own growth, understanding that our hybrid nature necessitates a gradual and guided approach to spiritual development.
In conclusion, our status as hybrid beings is a profound gift, offering us unparalleled opportunities for growth and transformation. However, it also places us in a position of unique vulnerability, requiring constant guidance and protection. As we walk the Butterfly Path, let us embrace both the potential and the limitations of our hybrid nature, always grateful for the loving guidance of our Divine Tara. For it is through this guided journey that we will eventually emerge from our chrysalis, transformed into the fully realized spiritual beings we are destined to become.

## SOUL-people and SPIRIT-people
In Wayist philosophy, students on the campus are understood to be at different stages of spiritual evolution, different grades is the school of divinity for souls.
2 Soul-people are those still primarily identified with soul-mind values and priorities. They are the majority on the campus and in democratic processes, elect candidates who reflect their values, frequently leading to dystopian regimes and a sorrowful world.
3 They are focused on power seeking, domination, individual prosperity, tribe affiliation, social standing, excess, physical appearance, competition, getting something for little effort, and consumerist achievements, often unaware of their higher spiritual potential. This is normal and how it will be in the beginning, how it was for all in the beginning.
4 Spirit-people, in contrast, have awakened to their divine essence and are consciously evolving towards spiritual maturity, slowly gaining higher-self dominance over lower-self minds. It is not about suppressing soul minds, but about sanctifying --- reprogramming them to prioritize self-development and higher-self priorities while living fully.
5 They live with awareness of their interconnectedness with all life and are guided by higher principles.
6 The transition from soul-person to spirit-person is the essence of the spiritual journey on the Butterfly Path.
7 This evolution is not about judgment or superiority, but a natural progression of spiritual awareness and mastery of spiritual skills and priorities while living fully and deeply.
8 Soul-people learn through experience and karmic lessons, gradually awakening to their true nature.
9 Spirit-people learn through reflection, self-knowledge, self-craft, meaning-making, and serve as wayshowers, embodying higher consciousness and inspiring others through their example.
10 The wise Wayist cultivates compassion for all, recognizing that each being is at their perfect stage of evolution.
11 The goal is not to escape being human, but to fully embody our divine potential within human form.
12 Let the Wayist reflect on their own journey from soul to spirit, nurturing the awakening of their highest nature.

## The Principle of Energy Work
In the cosmic complexity of existence, everything is energy. This fundamental truth forms the cornerstone of Wayist practice and understanding. For the Person of theWAY, energy awareness and energy work are not mere adjuncts to spiritual practice, but its very essence. The importance of this principle cannot be overstated, for it underpins our entire approach to spiritual growth, healing, and service.
Consider the multifaceted nature of our being. We possess ten minds - three soul minds, four spirit minds, and three organic-body minds - each a complex energy center operating at different wavelengths. Our ethereal bodies - the soul body and the spirit body - are pure energy constructs. Even our organic body, seemingly solid and material, is at its core a manifestation of energy. Given this reality, it becomes not just beneficial, but absolutely essential for the Wayist to develop a profound awareness of energy and to master the skills of energy work.
This emphasis on energy is not an abstract concept, but a practical necessity. Our thoughts, our emotions, our very consciousness - all are expressions of energy. Therefore, to truly understand ourselves, to heal, to grow, and to fulfill our purpose on the Butterfly Path, we must become adept at energy management and energy healing. These are not peripheral skills, but core competencies for every Wayist.
The significance of energy work extends far beyond our current incarnation. As we progress on our spiritual journey, we are preparing for our future existence as spiritual energy beings in the spiritual energy domain. In this future state, we will be tasked with caregiving and chrestotes work for soul beings across our galaxy. The energy awareness and skills we develop now are the foundation for this cosmic service. By mastering energy work in our current human condition, we are not only facilitating our own growth but also preparing for our eternal vocation.
The focus on energy work in theWAY is ancient. When Lord Jesus re-established the teachings of theWAY approximately 2,000 years ago, energy healing was at the forefront of his ministry. He trained hundreds of energy healers and dispatched them as energy workers to various regions. The Christian scriptures, which appropriated many Wayist teaching, clearly depict Jesus's emphasis on energy work, healing, and the removal of mali-psyches (often mistranslated as "demons" or \"evil spirits\" (in Wayist teaching a spiritual being, by definition and nature, cannot be \"evil\", they are beneficent in essence)). Indeed, if we were to summarize the significance of Lord Jesus's ministry, it would be: "to re-establish teachings of theWAY, to train energy workers, and to demonstrate these skills through healing and the expulsion of mali-psyches."
The Wayist approach to energy work is comprehensive and multifaceted:
1 Energy Awareness: Developing a keen sensitivity to the energy within and around us, recognizing the subtle interplay of energies in all aspects of life.
2 Energy Maintenance: Regular practices to cleanse, balance, and strengthen our own energy systems, including all ten minds and our various energy bodies.
3 Energy Healing: Learning techniques to channel healing energies to ourselves and others, addressing imbalances and promoting wholeness.
4 Energy Protection: Developing skills to shield ourselves and others from harmful energies, including the influence of mali-psyches.
5 Energy Transmission: Cultivating the ability to transmit beneficial energies to others, spaces, and situations, promoting harmony and spiritual growth.
6 Energy Discernment: Honing our ability to distinguish between different types of energies, recognizing both beneficial and detrimental influences.
7 Energy Transformation: Learning to transmute lower energies into higher, more refined spiritual energies.
As we progress in our energy work, we begin to perceive the world in a new light. We recognize the energy signatures in all things - in food, in spaces, in nature, in other beings. We become aware of the energetic ecology that surrounds us, understanding our place within this vast energetic web of existence.
This heightened awareness brings with it great responsibility. As we become more adept at energy work, we must also cultivate wisdom and compassion in its application. We learn to respect the energetic boundaries of others, to use our skills for the highest good, and to align our energy work with the flow of theWAY.
The mastery of energy work is not an endpoint but an ongoing journey. As we evolve spiritually, our capacity for energy work expands, opening new vistas of understanding and service. This continuous growth in energy awareness and skill is a fundamental aspect of our progression on the Butterfly Path.
In conclusion, energy work is not a peripheral aspect of Wayist practice - it is the very essence of our spiritual journey. It is through energy work that we heal ourselves, serve others, and prepare for our eternal role as spiritual caregivers. By fully embracing this fundamental principle, we align ourselves more deeply with theWAY, accelerating our spiritual evolution and enhancing our ability to contribute to the cosmic dance of energy that is existence itself.
Let every Wayist, therefore, approach energy work with the utmost seriousness and dedication. For in mastering the subtle currents of energy that flow through all things, we master ourselves, and in doing so, we take a profound step towards fulfilling our highest purpose in the grand design of theWAY.

## Mystical and Existential Path
The Wayist Path is in essence a mystical path, deeply rooted in direct spiritual experience and communion with the divine. We necessarily walk with deities, attuning our higher-selves to the energies of our Divine Tara. This mystical connection is not abstract or theoretical, but a lived reality for the Wayist.
2 Through practices like meditation and prayer, we open ourselves to divine guidance and wisdom. These are not mere rituals, but gateways to profound spiritual experiences. In deep meditation, a Wayist may experience states of expanded consciousness, glimpsing realities beyond the veil of ordinary perception. In prayer, we engage in intimate dialogue with our Divine Tara, feeling their loving presence and receiving intuitive guidance.
3 We use higher-self wisdom and skills to gradually transform our soul-minds, sanctifying them through consistent spiritual practice. This inner alchemy is a mystical process, as we refine our energies and elevate our consciousness. The goal is to become the very best version of ourselves possible, aligning with the highest purpose of Butterfly Path.
4 Wayism is also fundamentally an existential path. By "existential," we mean that it deals directly with the core issues of human existence - the search for meaning, the nature of being, our place in the cosmos, and how to live authentically in the face of life's uncertainties and challenges.
5 As Wayists, we don't rely on abstract philosophies or blind faith. Instead, we engage directly with the raw material of our lives, finding profound meaning and purpose in our everyday experiences. We recognize that we are responsible for creating meaning in our lives, and we do this through conscious engagement with our spiritual journey.
6 The existential nature of Wayism is evident in how we approach life's big questions. We don't seek easy answers or comforting illusions. Instead, we face the sometimes uncomfortable truths of existence - impermanence, suffering, the inevitability of death - and find a way to live joyfully and purposefully in spite of (and even because of) these realities.
7 We live this spirituality in our every breath; it is not a part-time practice but the very purpose of our lives. It is all-encompassing as we traverse lifetimes, experiencing joy, sorrow, passion, and a myriad of experiences. This makes Wayism a deeply practical path that we follow full-time.
8 In this sense, every cognitive Wayist is like a monk, but not one secluded in a monastery. Our monastery is the world itself, and our practice is living life to the fullest, with full awareness and spiritual intention. We find the sacred in the ordinary, the profound in the mundane.
9 Through this mystical and existential approach, we gradually awaken to our true nature as fledgling spiritual beings having human experiences through which we grow wise. We learn to see beyond the illusions of Maya, recognizing the deeper realities that underlie our existence. And as we do so, we move ever closer to our ultimate destiny - evolving into immortal spiritual beings and returning to our heavenly home.

## Immortal Spirit Guides
### Our Divine Taras
In Wayist understanding, each soul on the Butterfly Path is accompanied by an immortal spirit guide, known as a Divine Tara.
2 The Sanskrit designation Tara means, 'they who ferry us from one shore to the next'. Every human soul has a dedicated Divine Tara who had been allocated to it since first setting foot on Butterfly Path. One can cultivate the skill to step into cognitive, two-way relationship with one's Tara.
3 Divine Taras serve as mentors, protectors, and companions on our spiritual journey, ever-present yet often unrecognized.
4 They communicate through intuition, dreams, and moments of spiritual insight, guiding us towards our highest good.
5 The wise Wayist cultivates a relationship with their Divine Tara through meditation, prayer, and mindful living.
6 This relationship deepens as we evolve, becoming more conscious and interactive as we awaken to our spiritual nature.
7 Divine Taras do not control or dictate, but offer wisdom and support, respecting our free will and the necessity of our own learning.
8 They serve as a link to the higher spiritual realms, helping us to navigate the subtle energies of the cosmos.
9 As we progress, we learn to discern the voice of our Divine Tara from the chatter of the ego or lower psychic impressions.
10 The ultimate purpose of this guidance is to awaken us to our own divine nature, to the guru within.
11 In the highest stages of evolution, we merge with our Divine Tara's energies, recognizing it as same as our own true self.
12 Let the Wayist honor and cultivate their relationship with their Divine Tara, for in this sacred communion lies a key to spiritual unfoldment.

## Path of Authenticity
In the journey of spiritual evolution, authenticity stands as a cornerstone of Wayist practice. It is the foundation upon which all genuine growth and transformation must be built. To be authentic is to be true to one's innermost nature, to stand naked before the mirror of self-knowledge, stripped of illusions and pretenses.
The human condition is one of complexity and paradox. We are beings of vast potential, yet often trapped in the narrow confines of our conditioning. Our souls, ancient and wise, are frequently overshadowed by the clamor of our more recent, surface-level identities. The chameleon nature of the soul, its ability to adapt and blend, while useful for survival, can become a barrier to true self-understanding.
To embark on the path of self-craft, we must first know the self we seek to transform. This is no easy task. The soul, in its wisdom, has learned to wear many masks, to shift and change in response to its environment. It seeks new identities, adapts to popular narratives, and is shaped by cultural conditioning. In this constant flux, the question arises: Who are we, truly?
Wayism teaches that to pierce the veils of illusion surrounding the self, we must first understand our own nature. We are not singular entities, but complex systems of body, soul, and emerging spirit. We are composed of multiple minds - the brain-mind, soul-minds, and spirit-minds - each with its own perspective and agenda. To know ourselves, we must become familiar with all these aspects of our being.
Moreover, we must confront uncomfortable truths about our place in the cosmos. We are mortal beings, our lives but brief flashes in the vast expanse of time. On the scale of our planet, let alone the universe, we are insignificant specks. The animals we often dismiss as lesser beings possess intelligence that can rival and sometimes surpass our own in specific domains. Even our vaunted human intelligence is being matched and exceeded by artificial constructs of our own making.
These realizations, far from diminishing us, serve to liberate us from the prison of our ego. They foster humility, a quality essential for true self-knowledge. In humility, we become open to seeing ourselves as we truly are, not as we wish to be seen.
Only when we have stripped away the layers of pretense, when we have embraced our authentic selves with all our flaws and limitations, can we begin the work of self-craft. Like a sculptor facing a block of marble, we cannot shape what constantly shifts and changes. We need a stable foundation, a true understanding of the material we seek to transform.
This process of discovering and embracing our authentic self is not a one-time event, but an ongoing journey. It requires courage to face ourselves honestly, compassion to accept what we find, and wisdom to discern the true from the false.
The rewards of this journey are immense. As we become more authentic, we align more closely with the flow of theWAY. Our actions become more effective, our relationships more genuine, our spiritual practices more profound. We begin to live from a place of inner truth rather than external expectation.
Moreover, authenticity is the key to unlocking our unique gifts and purpose. Each soul has its own dharma, its own path to walk. By embracing our authentic nature, we discover what we are truly called to do and be in this life.
In the end, the path of authenticity leads us to a paradoxical truth: by fully embracing who we are, we open the door to becoming who we are meant to be. It is through honest self-knowledge that we lay the groundwork for genuine transformation.
Let us then commit to this path of authenticity. Let us have the courage to look deeply into ourselves, to embrace all that we find there - the beautiful and the ugly, the noble and the base. For it is only in knowing ourselves truly that we can begin the sacred work of self-craft, of aligning our being with the highest truths of theWAY.
In authenticity, we find not only self-knowledge, but also profound connection - to ourselves, to others, to the divine flow of existence itself. It is the bedrock upon which all true spiritual growth is built, the fertile soil in which the seeds of our highest potential can take root and flourish.

## Udbhu-kanti
### Authenticity is Ultimate Beauty
Udbhu-kanti is the Wayist practice of embracing authenticity and simplicity in all aspects of life. It is the art of finding beauty in the genuine and value in the modest.
2 The Wayist who practices Udbhu-kanti cherishes old and repurposed items, recognizing the rich history and character they carry. She sees beauty in the worn and weathered, understanding that true value often lies beneath the surface.
3 Central to Udbhu-kanti is the principle of "knowing your enough." The Wayist identifies the bare minimum required for contentment and lives accordingly. This frees her from the endless pursuit of excess.
4 By embracing sufficiency, the Wayist discovers true abundance. Resources not spent on unnecessary wants can be directed towards meaningful experiences and spiritual growth.
5 Udbhu-kanti teaches resilience. When one is accustomed to living within their "enough," challenges such as job loss or financial setbacks become less daunting.
6 The practice extends to our relationship with the natural world. Wayists are encouraged to grow food, sprout seeds, even in small spaces, fostering a direct connection with the earth and its cycles.
7 In Udbhu-kanti, possessions are chosen for durability and utility rather than fashion or status. A piece of furniture meant to last a lifetime is valued over the latest trend.
8 This practice cultivates a mindset of stewardship rather than ownership. The Wayist sees herself as a caretaker of her possessions, responsible for their maintenance and thoughtful use.
9 Udbhu-kanti fosters creativity and resourcefulness. The Wayist finds innovative ways to meet needs without relying on constant consumption.
10 Through this practice, the Wayist discovers that true richness lies not in accumulation, but in appreciation. She finds joy in the simple, beauty in the humble, and wealth in relationships and experiences.
11 Ultimately, Udbhu-kanti is a path to freedom - freedom from the tyranny of wants, from the pressure of social expectations, and from the anxiety of never having enough. In this freedom, the Wayist finds peace and contentment.
11
## The Mystic Rebirth
According to Tradition, this is the conversation Lord Jesus had with a seeker named Nicodemus.
Harken, O seeker of truth, to the whispered wisdom of ages past. For within the depths of your being lies a seed of divinity, waiting to sprout and blossom into radiant light.
2 As the lotus rises from muddy waters to unfold its petals to the sun, so too must the soul emerge from the mire of worldly existence to reveal its true splendor.
3 Verily, I say unto you, none shall glimpse the celestial realms unless they are born anew. For the eyes of flesh perceive only shadows, while the eyes of spirit behold eternal verities.
4 "But how," asks the earnest seeker, "can one be reborn when the body has grown old and weary?"
5 Know this: The rebirth of which I speak is not of flesh, but of spirit. As the wind moves unseen yet its effects are manifest, so too does the breath of the Divine stir the soul to awakening.
6 In ancient days, the wise ones spoke of the dvija - the twice-born. First birthed from the womb of woman, then birthed again from the womb of wisdom.
7 The sadhaka, ever-striving, awakens the seed of aspiration in the soil of the heart. With devotion it is watered, with discipline it is tended, until at last it breaks forth into the light of realization.
8 Blessed are the paripakva, the fully ripened ones, in whom the fruit of enlightenment has reached its sweet perfection. These are the twice-born, radiating the fragrance of divine gnosis.
9 O Nicodemus, marvel not at these words. For just as you hear the wind but know not its origin or destination, so too are the ways of spirit beyond the grasp of mortal minds.
10 Yet know this: The kingdom of heaven dwells within you, waiting to be unveiled. Cast off the shroud of ignorance and be clothed anew in the light of truth.
11 For flesh begets flesh, bound to the wheel of birth and death. But spirit begets spirit, soaring free in the boundless sky of liberation.
12 Therefore, dear ones, nurture the divine seed within. Let your old self wither away like autumn leaves, making way for the new self to emerge in the springtime of awakening.
13 This is theWAY - the path of mystic rebirth. Walk it with courage and faith, for at journey's end awaits your true home in the embrace of the Eternal.
12
## Wayist Spiritual Communities
The lessons you seek on theWAY are ever-present, awaiting your awakened perception.
2 Live each day with delight, for in the mundane lies the sacred.
3 Your neighbors, bearers of wonderful cultures and lifestyles, are teachers at your doorstep.
4 If fortune allows travel, seek wisdom from diverse communities; yet know that profound insights often dwell in your own backyard.
5 Neighbors and teachers reside in your planters, your home, the park and in the creek nearby.
6 Millions of different creatures, billions of fellow wayfarers, surround you always.
7 Thus spoke the Teacher: "Love your neighbors as yourself, for in this, you embrace theWAY and will see Heaven."
8 The world teems with neighbors to meet, engage, and learn from.
9 How many dwell in your community? How many have you truly befriended?
10 To live fully is to recognize the lessons in all encounters, from the squirrel to the sparrow, the swan to the immigrant senior.
11 Cognitive Wayists also benefit from community centers and retreats, sanctuaries for recharging and deepening understanding.
12 In times of struggle, solace can be found in the company of like-minded souls.
13 Even in death, community provides comfort and understanding.
14 If your current environment hinders soul development, seek a community more conducive to growth.
15 Wayist coaches require training, and practitioners need access to brief retreats.
16 Wayist satsang serve as centers for devotional and ethical learning, where cognitive Wayists gather.
17 Simplicity is key; if you discover a palatial center, seek the back door and depart.
18 For the Wayist, the planet is our temple, our minds and souls our inner shrines.
19 Any humble structure suffices for congregation; be the joy that plants equanimity in the minds of others.
20 In this way, the Wayist community flourishes, not through grandeur, but through authentic connection and shared purpose.
*Master Yang says, "The planet is our temple where we worship, our minds and souls are our inner shrines where we meditate, and any old building will do where we congregate. Rather than a tower or a bell that commands the community; you be the joy that plants equanimity in their minds."*
*Master Yin says, "Oh, my dear Sir...you brought me flowers."*
## PART II
### ONTOLOGY
### THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE
In this section, we explore the fundamental nature of Reality as understood in Wayist philosophy. From the ineffable Absolute to the manifest universe, we examine the cosmic principles that underlie all of existence. And we look at the teaching of why souls come here to have human experiences. Here, the seeker will find the foundational concepts that form the ancient basis of Wayist understanding.
13
## The Absolute
The Absolute, the Ineffable, dwells beyond the reach of thought and word. It is THAT of which ancient seers spoke in hushed tones, whispering, the Void that is Full, the Nothingness that contains All.
2 As the Upanishads declare, "Neti, neti" - "Not this, not that." No concept can capture Its essence, no language can confine Its vastness.
3 In the silence of deep meditation, when the mind's chatter ceases, a glimpse of THAT may be sensed - yet It remains forever beyond cognitive grasp.
4 We speak of It as the Absolute, yet the term is insufficient. We call It the Absolute, the Nil, the Void, yet It transcends all numbering.
5 The Absolute is not an entity separate from creation, nor is It identical with creation. It is the ground of all being, yet no being can claim It as their own.
6 In our limited understanding, we say the Absolute gives birth to the manifest universes. Yet in truth, nothing is ever born or destroyed in the Absolute's infinite, eternal presence.
7 The wise humbly acknowledge their inability to comprehend the Absolute. In this unknowing, they come closest to true knowing.
8 In the end, silence is the most fitting response to the Absolute. Let us honor the THAT with our quietude and wonder.
14
## The Unfathomable One
### The Source
The Unfathomable One proceeds from the Absolute,\
gives birth to Two.\
Two gives birth to Three.\
Three gives birth to all things.
2 The One, named as Source by some,\
for us is the Unfathomable One.\
Mere creatures cannot fathom the One,\
nor the Divine Chaos of all Energies,\
forever being created and recycled.
3 Emanating from the Unfathomable One;\
a single force proceeds\
in Two polarities, the Yin and Yang.\
As Cosmic Yin and Cosmic Yang perceived
4 From the Two;\
the Three proceed\
within which, all things are conceived\
All are created,\
all are held, and all are animated.
5 As creatures, we fathom neither Absolute nor the One.\
We can but observe the Three, The Way, in awe of how it is done.\
By grace of The Way, one day --- a soul, a spirit child become.
15
## The Two
### Cosmic Yin and Cosmic Yang
Two forces flow from the One\
called Cosmic Yin and Cosmic Yang by some\
or the Yin and Yang of the One.
2 In the Way we distinguish and describe, and we should not (for it is not proper), the Yang's nature to be like spirit, sky, sun, light, fire, heat, dry, directive, hard, knowledge, and male.
3 In the Way we distinguish and describe, and we should not (for it is not proper), the Yin's nature to be the like soul, earth, moon, dark, moist, subtle, soft, nurturing, wisdom, and female.
4 Together, and never apart, the Two work as one.\
Loving one another, each sharing the other,\
each more present in one thing\
and less in another.
5 The Two flow everywhere; the essence of all that exist.\
All depend on it, and none are refused.
It flows into its task; creatures abound, nourishing infinite worlds, clothing and feeding. Yet it does not claim ownership and has no favorites.
6 Eternally without need, claiming nothing, it is ultimately humble. As all things naturally flow back into the One, it is truly Great.
The Wayist thus desires not greatness --- yet, she imitates the Great.
7 The One, through the Yang engender all of them,\
the Yin animates them,\
the Law of Maya shapes them,\
the environment perfects them,\
and no claim of ownership is made over them.
8 All developed souls recognize the Way and honor the Cosmic Yang and the Cosmic Yin; not by command but by free will.
9 In the microcosm, the Two; in the macrocosm, the Two.
10 Through the Two, we share with all creation minute design and inherent energies, which hold and uphold all the universes dark and light, non-manifest and manifest.
16
## The Three
### The Way of Our Universe
The Absolute instructed the One in the Forms. The One instructed the Two to leela-play the Forms, to create the Three, somewhere inside infinity.
Cosmic Yin and Cosmic Yang gave rise to a divine System, the Structure and Plan we call The Way.
2 Within the Great Infinite Divine Chaos of the One, a system which organizes the way all energies within it shall play --- a system with a plan, and a vision of a universe, exist as The Way.
3 It is named the Three for it came third; in it the energies and Laws are structured by Domain: Domain of Spiritual Energy, Domain of Soul Energy, and Domain of Material Energy.\
4 The universe as we know it exists within The Way.\
Laws of physics and metaphysics regulate the system\
Its energies organized and told how to play.
5 Soul entities from Soul Energy Domain\
incarnate to material bodies in Material Domain.
6 Inside, outside and throughout, the Divine is present in us. We have the Cosmic Yin and the Cosmic Yang --- truly, their energies course through our very being.
*Master Yang said, "Madam, just as planets revolve around a sun, and moons revolve around a planet, and the number and nature of that combination makes each solar system unique, so too do things and their moons revolve around the core of the atom and the nature and combination of it makes the atom unique. Atoms do not collide and do not fall apart all the time. What can be said to be responsible for the respectful distance, the frequency of the vibration, the number of manifest and un-manifest satellites that revolve around the core, and how are these trillions upon trillions of atoms kept in good order so that we may have a piece of wood, a fire, and blood in our veins?*
*Master Yin said, "Sir, that is why the Teacher says, the One is closer to us than our hand."*
*Master Yang said, "Yes, Madam, thank you for reminding me. Thing is, I am wondering, if unique atoms are grouped together, trillions of them, to make elements, compounds, organisms and all that---what do we get when we group together solar systems, trillions of them, to make galaxies, and those are grouped together, trillions of them---what do we get?*
*Master Yin said, "Sir, all I know is that the most intelligent semiconductor processor is a created thing, it is, not unlike you, made of combinations of atoms and stuff, and it is highly intelligent and has changed the world---yet, it does not and cannot know the mind of Mr. Rich Templeton and it knows nothing about silica. Please try to get some sleep. If you don't get enough sleep, you will snore and tomorrow you will be grumpy. You're not a microchip, you know."*
17
## Our Spirit Heaven
Beyond the Realms of Matter and Soul, in the Domain of Spirit Energy, nestled among heavens of other spirit species, lies Sukhavati, our Spirit Heaven --- the Pure Land of Bliss.
2 Sukhavati is not a place of eternal rest, but a realm of joyous activity and continued growth, where enlightened beings serve the cosmos with love and wisdom.
3 This heavenly abode resonates with the highest spiritual frequencies, its very essence composed of compassion, wisdom, and boundless love.
4 At the heart of Sukhavati reign Amitabha and Pandaravasini, known to us as God our Father and God our Mother in Heaven.
5 Amitabha, whose Sanskrit title means "Bright Light King of Heaven," embodies the yang principle of divine compassion. His radiance illuminates the path for seeking souls.
6 Pandaravasini, whose Sanskrit title means "White-Robed Queen of Heaven," represents the dark-light, the yin aspect of infinite wisdom. Her embrace nurtures the spiritual growth of all children.
7 Together, these divine parents oversee the evolution of souls throughout our galaxy, guiding the grand design of spiritual unfoldment.
8 In Sukhavati, enlightened beings known as Taras serve as emissaries of Amitabha and Pandaravasini, reaching out to guide and protect souls still journeying on Butterfly Path.
9 The energy of Sukhavati is not distant or separate from us, we have a spark of Heaven in our Anahata, waiting to be realized, accessible to those who cultivate spiritual awareness.
10 Through practices such as Divine Tarayoga and deep meditation, we can attune ourselves to the vibrations of Sukhavati, drawing inspiration and strength for our journey.
11 As we progress on Butterfly Path, we gradually harmonize our being with the frequencies of Sukhavati, preparing for our eventual rebirth in this celestial realm.
12 In Sukhavati, time flows differently, unbounded by earthly limitations. A single day there may encompass eons of earthly time, allowing for vast spiritual work to be accomplished.
13 The landscapes of Sukhavati surpass earthly beauty, with spiritual energy structures unimaginable by the caterpillar mind but Reality to the butterfly perspective.
14 Yet, Sukhavati is not a static paradise. It is a dynamic realm of spiritual energy workers engaged in continued learning, service, and evolution, where enlightened beings take on ever greater responsibilities in the cosmic order.
15 From Sukhavati, advanced enlightened beings may choose to emanate into various forms throughout the universe, guiding and uplifting countless worlds.
16 As we cultivate virtue and wisdom on Butterfly Path, we are in essence building our future body of light, the vehicle through which we will exist and serve in Sukhavati.
17 Remember, O seeker, that glimpses of Sukhavati can be experienced here and now, in moments of profound spiritual connection and selfless love.
18 Let the reality of Sukhavati inspire your journey. Know that with each step on Butterfly Path, you draw closer to this divine home and to reunion with our Heavenly Parents.
19 For purposes of aiding brain-mind to visualize and take part in meditation in higher-self minds, People of theWAY use graphic images of heavenly beings, for as long as humans existed. These graphics are necessarily anthropomorphic representations and we know full well that spiritual beings, gods, do not have human features or material bodies.
20 But the brain-mind needs some anchor to help it go with the flow of higher-self purposes --- and that is why we give it the graphic images it needs. Every culture throughout history created their own versions of images of heaven and God our Father and God our Mother, all the while respecting that the images do not represent reality but are fingers pointing at the moon.
21 In your meditations, visualize Sukhavati not only as a distant realm, but beginning in the innermost sanctum of your heart, where the divine energies of God our Father Amitabha and God our Mother Pandaravasini already dwell, awaiting your full awakening.
22 May all beings realize their connection to Sukhavati, and through this realization, transform our world into a reflection of that Pure Land of Bliss.
18
## The Psychomesion
The Psychomesion is the great in-between, a realm bridging the material and spiritual domains.
2 Imagine a vast, misty expanse where souls journey after departing their physical forms.
3 Within this cosmic thoroughfare lies Paradise, a sanctuary of light amidst the ethereal mists.
4 The Psychomesion is not merely a place, but a state of being too, where the laws of physical reality no longer bind.
5 Here, souls shed the weight of earthly existence, yet retain the essence of their experiences and learnings.
6 Some souls pass swiftly through this realm, drawn by the 'magnetic' pull of Paradise or the next incarnation.
7 Others linger, caught in the web of attachment or confusion, resistant to the natural flow of spiritual evolution.
8 In the Psychomesion, advanced Wayist energy workers may encounter these wayward souls, offering guidance and compassion.
9 Paradise, nestled within this realm, is a haven of peace and reflection, yet not the final destination.
10 In Paradise, souls review their past lives, integrate wisdom, and prepare for future journeys on the Butterfly Path.
11 The Psychomesion teaches us that transition is a fundamental aspect of existence, even beyond physical death.
12 Let the Wayist reflect on this in-between realm, as it reveals the connectedness of our spiritual voyage and allows us to transition without fear when our physical body expires.
19
## Our Soul Heaven
Between incarnations, human souls find respite in a realm of light - this is our temporary soul heaven, known in Sanskrit as Purusthana, in English as Paradise.
2 Paradise is not a final destination, but a waystation on our cosmic journey, a place of rest and reflection.
3 Here, souls process the experiences of their past lives, integrating lessons learned and preparing for future incarnations.
4 Paradise exists within the Psychomesion, the intermediate realm between the physical and spiritual domains.
5 In this celestial abode, souls commune with their kind, free from the limitations and sufferings of earthly existence.
6 Yet Paradise is not eternal bliss, for the soul still carries the seeds of desire and the need for further growth.
7 Some souls, burdened by unresolved karma, may resist the call to return to incarnation. They may opt out, or be expelled from Butterfly Path school, and be returned to their prior soul heavens in the Domain of Soul Energy, hence they came.
8 But the wise soul understands that each earthly life is a precious opportunity for evolution and eagerly awaits rebirth.
9 At death of the body, the soul is guided to Paradise by your Divine Tara, a holy spirit, a celestial being who tutor and oversee your progress on the Butterfly Path. Each human has a Divine Tara from the day we first set foot on Butterfly Path.
10 The duration of a soul's stay in Paradise varies, determined by its karmic needs and evolutionary stage.
11 Remember, O Wayist, that your time in Paradise is but a pause in the greater journey. Use it wisely to reflect and prepare, before the gravity-like pull to a new incarnation catches you by surprise.
12 For the ultimate goal is not to remain in Paradise, but to transcend it, graduating from soul to spirit, from Paradise to Sukhavati.
20
## The Laws of The Way
The Laws of The Way are not imposed from without, but are the very fabric of existence itself.
2 These Laws govern the unfolding of all phenomena, from the dance of atoms to the evolution of souls.
3 They are not decrees of a divine lawgiver, but the inherent nature of reality, discoverable by the wise.
4 To understand these Laws is to align oneself with the cosmic order, to flow effortlessly with the currents of life.
5 The Wayist seeks not to control or manipulate these Laws, but to harmonize with their subtle rhythms.
6 In their interplay, we find the dance of existence - the ebb and flow of creation, preservation, and dissolution.
7 These Laws are impartial, applying equally to all beings, yet their effects manifest uniquely for each.
8 They are the guiding principles of our spiritual evolution, shaping our journey on the Butterfly Path.
9 Through contemplation and experience, the Wayist comes to know these Laws intimately, embodying their wisdom.
10 In this knowing, we transcend the illusion of separation, recognizing our oneness with the cosmic process.
11 Let us explore these Laws with reverence and humility, for in them lies the key to our ultimate liberation.
12 As we align with these Laws, we become conscious co-creators in the grand tapestry of existence.
21
## \~ Law of Evolution
Evolution is the heartbeat of existence, the eternal dance of becoming that animates all creation.
2 It is not mere biological adaptation, but the cosmic principle of progressive unfoldment.
3 All things may evolve - matter into mind, mind into soul, soul into spirit.
4 The soul, too, is subject to this Law, growing through myriad experiences across countless lifetimes.
5 Evolution is not linear but spiral, each turn bringing us to a higher octave of understanding.
6 It operates through the twin forces of challenge and response, each obstacle an opportunity for growth.
7 The wise Wayist aligns with this Law, actively participating in their own soul consciousness evolution.
8 Yet evolution cannot be forced or hurried; it unfolds in its own time, like the blooming of a flower.
9 The ultimate goal of evolution is the awakening of our divine nature, the butterfly emerging from its chrysalis.
10 This Law teaches us patience and perseverance, for true transformation is often slow and subtle.
11 In embracing evolution, we embrace change itself, letting go of the old to make way for the new.
12 Let the Wayist contemplate this Law deeply, for in understanding evolution, we understand the very essence of life.
22
## \~ Law of Reincarnation
Reincarnation is part of the cosmic principle all souls beings are subject to, the cycle of transmigration of souls from one body to the next. Samsara, is how the ancient teachers named it.
2 It is the natural way of life for all souls. When the organic body within which they reside becomes unviable, the soul departs to its heaven to enter the process for the next transmigration. This is the way of the soul.
3 Through reincarnation, the human soul gathers wisdom from diverse human experiences, slowly awakening its spiritual potential, evolving into a being who incarnate at will, only when required.
4 This Law ensures that no lesson is truly lost, no experience wasted in the grand tapestry of spiritual evolution.
5 Reincarnation operates in conjunction with Karma, each human life shaped by the accumulated actions of past lives. Karma, alone, decides each incarnation and it is finely tailored to the individual's learning needs.
6 It is the great equalizer, allowing each human soul to experience the full spectrum of human existence over time, all genders, ethnicities, social positions, and circumstances.
7 The wise Wayist views each life as precious, a rare opportunity for growth on the path to enlightenment.
8 Yet attachment to past lives is discouraged, for it is the wisdom gained, not the details, that truly matters.
9 Reincarnation teaches us compassion, for in others we see reflections of our own past and future selves.
10 It reminds us that our current life is but one chapter in a much grander story of holistic human experiences and spiritual becoming.
11 Understanding this Law frees us from the fear of death, revealing it as a transition rather than an end.
12 Let the Wayist contemplate the profound implications of reincarnation, for in it lies the key to understanding the continuity of consciousness.
23
## \~ Law of Maya
Maya is the cosmic principle of illusion, the veil that obscures the true nature of reality.
2 It is not mere deception, but the creative power that manifests the universe of name and form.
3 Maya creates the appearance of separation, allowing for the play of duality and individual experience. By the grace of Maya, our souls have no memory of past lives, only the wisdom gained.
4 It is through Maya that the One appears as many, the eternal masquerades as the temporal. It is through Maya that the realities of the earthworm and squirrel are different, and the junior student on the Path and the senior know different versions of reality. It is our protection to know only what we can deal with.
5 The wise Wayist seeks to penetrate the veil of Maya, to perceive the underlying unity of all existence.
6 Maya is not to be ignored, for it is also the stage upon which our spiritual evolution unfolds.
7 Maya teaches us discernment, challenging us to distinguish between the real and the apparent. The practice ground for this in everyday life right now. What is real, what is hype, what is fake, why is the story told, is history true, can you trust the food and chemical and medicine and money vendors like doctors, scientists, politicians, bankers?
8 It is both obstacle and opportunity - a challenge to our perception and a tool for our awakening.
9\. In the realm of Maya, all is relative - good and evil, pleasure and pain, birth and death.
10 The ultimate goal is not to escape Maya, but to progress to see through its veils, recognizing its divine play.
11 Maya reminds us that our perceptions are limited, encouraging humility and open-mindedness.
12 Let the Wayist dance with Maya mindfully, neither fully believing nor disbelieving, but always seeking the truth beyond appearances.
24
## \~ Law of Karma
Karma is the universal principle of cause and effect, the cosmic ledger that determines our curriculum on the Path.
2 It is not reward or punishment, but the natural consequence of our thoughts, words, and deeds which signal to Karma what learning opportunities we need to gain the skills to graduate.
3 Karma operates across lifetimes, shaping our circumstances and experiences in accordance with our past actions and skills gained.
4 Yet it is not fatalistic - each moment offers the opportunity to learn new skills and advance in the spiritual Path. There are no "positive" or "negative" karmic consequences. As with college, there are enjoyable classes and classes you would prefer not to take, but all are required. Some we fail and must do over. All karma is good, because all aim to help us graduate, notwithstanding how easy or hard that life might.
5 The wise Wayist understands that karma is not just about action, but inaction and intention as well - the energy behind our deeds.
6 Karma teaches responsibility and accountability, reminding us that we are the architects of our own destiny.
7 It operates on many levels - individual, collective, and national - interweaving our fates in complex ways. The group mind you share makes you share in the group karma. One sees this in the rise and fall of empires throughout history.
8 The Law of Karma encourages us to act with mindfulness, aware of the far-reaching effects of our choices, actions and inactions.
9 It is a teacher of compassion, for in understanding karma, we see the deeper causes of others' suffering, and we ponder what we did in past lives, and what we must learn in this life.
10 Karma is not to be feared, but embraced as a tool for spiritual growth and self-understanding.
11 The ultimate goal is to transcend karma altogether, acting without attachment to the fruits of our actions. Once we are reborn as spiritual beings in Sukhavati, the Law of Karma does not apply in the same way.
12 Let the Wayist contemplate this Law deeply, for in mastering karma lies the key to true freedom.
25
## \~ Law of Dharma
Dharma is the principle of Right Action, the personal, inner, sacred sense of duty derived from wisdom unique to each soul.
For the normal soul, its dharma is fixed, it is inherent in its species almost as if in its soul-DNA, so to speak. For the human, a hybrid soul / spirit being, dharma if developed by experiences in free will and karmic consequences. We learn to be "good and beneficent" not by design, but by will.
2 Our dharma is not an imposed moral code, but the natural expression of our deepest spiritual essence. For every new level of wisdom one develops, a new level of dharma develops in higher-self minds.
Wisdom is not wisdom if not put into action. As we evolve, so too does our dharma increase in intensity. We become divine because of dharma, our natural way of being, is aligned with the divine.
3 Each being has its own dharma, shaped by their unique karmic history, wisdom, and spiritual evolution.
4 The wise Wayist seeks to discern and fulfill their dharma, aligning their life with their purpose. Going against one's dharma triggers dharmic dissonance, resulting in uncomfortable feelings of having done wrong, or not having done the right thing --- not by moral code but by higher-self conviction of one's own dharma. Dharmic dissonance feels like a persistent nagging in the depths of our soul and minds. Chronic dharmic dissonance can drain one's soul and body energies, leading to illness.
5 Dharma is dynamic, evolving as we gain more wisdom - what is dharmic right action at one stage may not be at another. What is dharmic right action for one person may not be so for another. Therefore, says the Lord, "Do not judge, you don't have the measure by which to meet."
6 It guides us in making choices, showing the path that leads to our highest spiritual unfoldment.
7 Living in accordance with one's dharma brings inner peace and accelerates spiritual evolution.
8 Yet dharma can be challenging, often calling us to transcend our comfort zones and ego desires.
9 It is through dharma that we participate consciously in the cosmic dance of self-improvement and evolution, playing our unique part in the energy ecology of our personal world.
10 Dharma teaches us authenticity, encouraging us to be true to our innermost nature.
11 Understanding dharma frees us from comparison with others, for each path is uniquely our own. Deities are naturally good and cannot but be beneficent, because of their dharma.
12 No book, no teacher, no deity, can teach dharma; it is self-crafted through blood, sweat, tears and joy, over many lifetimes by each individual. It is uniquely yours. Your dharma is the only real estate you own outright, which, not only does it carry along as part of what defines you as a being, it is permanently who you are becoming and who you will be. Your wisdom expressed through living, is your dharma.
13 Let the Wayist contemplate deeply on their dharma, for in its fulfillment lies the key to spiritual mastery.
26
## \~ Law of Free Will
Free Will is the divine gift of choice, the power to shape our spiritual destiny. Without which, souls could not choose to become 'good' exceeding their nature, or love beyond the capacity of their soul nature. We will become "good" by crafting our dharma bit by byte, and once done, like deities, we will be good by nature --- incapable of doing "bad".
Without free will, human souls would not experience the immense variety of life experiences required to craft wisdom and the deep insight needed to graduate Butterfly Path.
2 It is the cornerstone of human experience, setting us apart from beings bound by instinct or the limitations of their soul minds alone.
3 Free Will operates within the framework of karma and circumstance, yet is never entirely constrained.
4 It is through the exercise of Free Will that we learn, grow, and eventually awaken our spiritual potential.
5 The wise Wayist uses this gift consciously, making choices aligned with their highest spiritual aspirations.
6 Free Will brings responsibility - we are accountable for our choices and their consequences.
7 It is the engine of spiritual evolution, allowing us to actively participate in our own transformation.
8 Yet Free Will can also lead us astray, when used unconsciously or driven by lower-self minds.
9 The ultimate use of Free Will is to freely will sanctity for the soul, remaking of the soul minds and nature, and becoming a spiritual being.
10 Free Will teaches us discernment, as we learn to distinguish between the promptings of lower-self and spirit.
11 It reminds us that in every moment, we have the power to choose anew, to redirect our path.
12 Let the Wayist honor this precious gift, using it wisely to further their journey on the Butterfly Path.
27
## \~ Law of Cyclic Return
The Law of Cyclic Return governs the rhythms of existence, the eternal dance of creation and dissolution.
2 All things move in cycles - from the turning of planets to the rise and fall of civilizations.
3 This Law reminds us that nothing is permanent\
that change is the only constant in the universe.
4 It teaches us to embrace the natural ebb and flow of life\
to find balance in the midst of constant change.
5 The wise Wayist aligns with these cycles\
understanding that both growth and rest have their place.
6 In nature we see this Law at work - in the seasons.
7 Our own lives follow this pattern - we too have our seasons of activity and repose, learning and integration.
8 The Law of Cyclic Return offers hope in times of darkness assuring us that light will return.
9 Yet it also cautions against complacency in times of prosperity reminding us that all things pass.
10 On a cosmic scale this Law governs the great cycles of universal manifestation and dissolution.
11 Understanding this Law helps us to let go to trust in the greater rhythms of existence.
12 Let the Wayist contemplate the cycles in their own life finding peace in the knowledge that all is in perfect motion.
28
## \~ Law of Non - Interference
The Law of Non-Interference teaches the wisdom to know of allowing things to unfold naturally, to not push the river. How will you know when karma has a better plan for you in store, or when your Tara is working on something that is better suited for you? That is the wisdom. It requires insight, trust, keen observation, and faith in the Laws.
2 It is the art of action without force, of influence without imposition.
3 This Law reminds us that the universe has its own intelligence, its own way of balancing and harmonizing. That Karma takes care of things in the manner and time it considers most suitable.
4 The wise Wayist learns to work with the flow of life, rather than constantly struggling against it.
5 Non-Interference does not mean inaction, but rather action that is in harmony with the natural order.
6 It teaches us patience and trust, allowing processes to unfold in their own time and way just as nature follows the Law of Non-Interference. Yet it does not mean sitting around waiting. Nothing comes, you go out there and create, live, but what about the wisdom to allow karma and Tara to work with you?
7 In relationships, this Law guides us to respect the journey of others, offering support without control. If you are not good for one another don't be together, if you are good for one another bring out the best in one another, else you will interfere in another's path or suffer their karmic consequences with them.
8 Non-Interference cultivates humility, reminding us that we are part of a greater whole, not its master.
9 It is closely linked to the Taoist concept of Wu Wei - effortless action in alignment with the Tao.
10 This Law cautions against the hubris of thinking we always know best and we must force our will, encouraging openness to life's wisdom and what our deity and Karma has in store for us.
11 Yet it also calls for discernment, knowing when to step back and when mindful intervention is necessary.
12 Let the Wayist practice Non-Interference in daily life, finding wisdom and power in gentleness and wisdom in letting be.
## PART III
### METAPHYSICAL ANATOMY
### The Human Condition
Having established the nature of existence, we turn to the profound question of what constitutes the human being and what does it mean to experience the human condition. This section illuminates the journey of the soul, from its origins through countless incarnations, to its ultimate destiny. We explore the realms of Paradise and Sukhavati, and our unique nature as hybrid beings on a path of spiritual evolution. We also analyze each part of the complex structure, the human, and its minds.
29
## Physiology, Psychology, and Pneumology
To understand The Way is to understand ourselves - body, soul, and spirit intertwined in sacred union.
2 Physiology speaks of our material nature its brain-mind, the vessel through which we experience earthly existence.
3 Psychology delves into the realm of soul minds, the seat of our thoughts, emotions, and individual consciousness.
4 Pneumology explores our spiritual essence and its minds, the divine spark that connects us to the highest realms.
5 These three aspects are not separate, but form a continuum of being, each influencing and shaping the others.
6 In the organic body, we find the temple of this event in our earthly journey, a miracle of intricate design and profound genetic wisdom.
7 In the psyche, we encounter the storehouse of wisdom from soul experiences, the crucible of our growth and transformation.
8 In the spirit, we touch our eternal nature, the wellspring of our highest aspirations and eternal wisdoms.
9 The Wayist seeks to harmonize these three aspects, recognizing that true wholeness arises from their integration.
10 Through this holistic understanding, we gain insight into the nature of our personal dharma and the workings of our karma.
11 We learn to navigate the currents of existence with greater skill, aligning ourselves with the flow of The Way.
12 Let us explore these dimensions of our being with reverence and curiosity, for in knowing ourselves, we come to know the universe.

## Pneumatherapy and Pneumapathy
O seeker of healing wisdom, hearken to the teachings of Pneumatherapy and Pneumapathy, the sacred arts of spiritual energy healing:
In the ancient days, when the Great Teacher walked among us, he laid hands upon the sick and cast out malevolent energies. This divine practice of healing through spiritual energy has been preserved and refined through the ages, becoming the disciplines of Pneumatherapy and Pneumapathy.
Pneuma, the breath of spirit, and psyche, the essence of soul, form the foundation of this holistic approach to healing. The Pneumatherapist, versed in the ways of energy and spirit, works not just with the physical form, but with the entire being - body, soul, mind, and spirit.
At the heart of this practice lies the understanding that all is energy. The human form is a complex interplay of energetic mind centers, known as chakras to some, each a mind with its own character, specialty, and wisdom. These chakra minds - from the earthly Muladhara to the celestial Sahasrara - form the tapestry of our inner being.
The skilled Pneumatherapist, through years of training and devotion, learns to perceive these subtle energies. With hands attuned to the divine flow, they sense the discord in the chakras, the blockages in the energy channels, the shadows that dim the spirit\'s light.
Yet the Pneumatherapist does not work alone. In sacred partnership with their Divine Tara, and often in communion with the patient\'s own celestial guide, they become a conduit for healing energies. It is not the therapist who heals, but the divine energy flowing through them.
The process begins with deep listening - not just to the words spoken, but to the whispers of the soul and the silent cries of the spirit. The Pneumatherapist, in their wisdom, helps the patient uncover the root of their ailment, for true healing begins with understanding.
Once the source is revealed, the work of healing commences. The therapist, guided by their Tara, removes toxic energies that have accumulated in the chakras. This is not a mere \"balancing\" as some might claim, but a true cleansing and rejuvenation of each mind-center.
Fresh, vital energy is then infused into the cleansed chakras, revitalizing the entire being. This sacred act of energy transfer is akin to the way a mother nurtures her child - with unconditional love and life-giving sustenance.
The practice of Pneumatherapy is as ancient as humanity itself. Even before we had words to describe it, our ancestors instinctively placed hands on areas of pain, unconsciously channeling healing energies. This innate wisdom has been refined and elevated through centuries of dedicated practice and spiritual insight.
From the early days of the Way, when the Teacher sent out seventy-two healers to minister to the people, to the present day, Pneumatherapists have walked among us, bringing light to the shadows of suffering. The stories of their works are many - from the healing touch of Thomas in ancient India to the compassionate ministrations of countless unnamed healers throughout history.
Remember, O seeker, that Pneumatherapy is not merely a technique, but a sacred calling. It requires not only skill and knowledge, but also deep compassion, unwavering ethics, and a profound connection to the divine flow of the Way.
As you contemplate these teachings, know that the power to heal lies within all of us. By cultivating our connection to the divine energy that flows through all things, we can become instruments of healing - for ourselves, for others, and for the world.
May the wisdom of Pneumatherapy guide your path, and may your hands become conduits of divine healing energy, bringing light to the shadows and comfort to the suffering.

## Human Soul
The human soul is a being of soul-light, or soul energy, and wisdom, evolving through countless incarnations on the Butterfly Path.
2 Unlike the souls of most animals, the human soul is allowed more free will, the power to shape its own destiny.
3 It is the repository of our deepest experiences, the keeper of lessons learned across many lifetimes.
4 The soul is not eternal in its current form, but has the potential to evolve into an immortal spiritual being.
5 It draws sustenance not from physical food, but from positive experiences of love, beauty, compassion, and wisdom. When we make of an experience a negative, or willfully engage negative experiences, they come at a cost to soul nutrition and wisdom. Persistent negative energy can cause a soul to wither away and may become unviable to continue on Butterfly Path.
6 The soul's journey is one of gradual awakening, from unconscious existence to full spiritual awareness.
7 Through its experiences in the material world, the soul refines itself, transmuting base instincts into higher virtues.
8 The human soul possesses three primary minds: Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura, each governing different aspects of our being.
9 As the soul matures, it develops the capacity to nurture the seed of spirit within, eventually giving 'birth' to its spiritual nature.
10 The ultimate destiny of the evolved soul is to merge with its awakened spirit, transcending the cycle of rebirth, moving out of the eternal sphere of Law of Samsara.
11 Yet even in its highest evolution, the soul retains the essence of wisdom from its human journey, enriching the spiritual realms with its unique insight of the nature of soul beings.
12 The human soul will depart from an organic body the moment it becomes unviable. Just as the souls of plants, animals, and other beings depart when the material body becomes unviable. This allows our material bodies to be recycled in nature, to be used as nutrition for others, keeping the cycle of life going.
13 Let the Wayist honor their soul, nurturing it with noble thoughts and deeds, for introspection and self-craft is the root of its evolution and sanctification, and in that lies the key to our divine becoming.
32
## Human Spirit
In the multidimensional webs of existence, the human spirit stands as a bridge between the temporal and the eternal, the finite and the infinite. It is the divine spark within, the essence of our divine potential that transcends the limitations of body and soul.
2 Unlike the soul, which evolves through countless incarnations, the spirit is a direct emanation of the Divine. It is the seed of our potential divinity, planted in the fertile soil of human experience.
3 The fledgling human spirit resides primarily in the higher-self minds - Anahata, Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara. These mind centers serve as spiritual wisdom processors, spiritual skills formation and learning, and for attuning to spiritual energies and divine connections.
4 In most humans, the spirit lies dormant, its potential unrealized. It is through conscious effort and spiritual practice that we awaken and nurture this divine essence.
5 The awakening of the spirit is a gradual process, often beginning with a stirring in the Anahata mind. This is experienced as a deepening sense of loving-kindness, a compassion for other life forms, discovery of new types of loves, development of the wisdom of chrestotes, an expansion of love beyond personal investments.
6 As the spirit grows in strength, it begins to transform the soul, sanctifying its energies and aligning them with higher purposes. This is the true meaning of Lord Jesus' teaching about *metanoia*, to reprogram your minds. This is the true meaning of being "born again" - the rebirth of the soul under the influence of the awakening spirit.
7 The Vishuddhi spirit-mind becomes activated as the spirit grows, leading to deeper understanding of spiritual wisdom and a deeper resonance with divine energies and connection with our Divine Guide.
8 The Ajna mind awakens and develops skills of spiritual insight and the ability to perceive subtle energy bodies. This is the seat of attuning to divine energies and connecting to various energy streams.
9 Finally, the Sahasrara or crown chakra blooms deeper connections with our Heaven, exerting its influence over all the minds of lower-self and higher-self, completing the sanctification of the soul.
10 The fully awakened human spirit is characterized by profound self-control, inner peace, chrestotes, and a sense of oneness with all creation. It is no longer bound by the limitations of soul identity but experiences itself as part of the heavenly family, the Divine Lotus Family of Sukhavati.
11 The spirit, once awakened, serves as a guiding light for the soul and body. It infuses thoughts, actions, and inactions with divine purpose to walk Butterfly Path with full intention and aligns the individual with the flow of theWAY.
12 Unlike the soul, which can become trapped in cycles of karma, the spirit remains untouched by worldly entanglements. It is the observer, the witness, the eternal aspect of our being.
13 The cultivation of the spirit is the highest purpose of human existence. It is through the spirit that we fulfill our destiny to become divine beings, family members of the Divine in our Heaven.
14 The relationship between the human spirit and the devotee's Divine Tara is intimate and profound. As the spirit awakens, it becomes increasingly attuned to the guidance and energy of the Divine Tara.
15 As you walk the Butterfly Path, let your actions be guided by the whispers of your spirit. In its gentle urgings lie the keys to your highest potential and deepest fulfillment.
16 Know that the awakening of your spirit is not just a personal achievement, but a gift to all who are also trying to graduate from the Path. As you allow your divine light to shine, you illuminate the path for others and contribute to the evolution of their spiritual awareness.
17 Therefore, tend to your spirit with utmost care and devotion. For in nurturing this divine seed within, you participate in the grandest of all endeavors - the realization of Heaven on Earth, the manifestation of Sukhavati in you in the here and now, and the forever after.
33
## The Organic Body
The organic body is a sacred vessel, a microcosm of the universe, crafted by divine intelligence.
2 More than mere flesh and bone, it is a living ecosystem, home to billions of intelligent microscopic beings.
3 Each cell, each organ, each system works in integrated, inter-reliant, harmony, a testament to the interconnectedness of all life.
4 The organic body is our primary tool for soul growth, providing the experiences necessary for spiritual evolution.
5 It is through the organic body that we interact with the material world, gathering wisdom through sensory perception.
6 Yet the body is transient and fragile, subject to birth, growth, decay, and death - a reminder of life's impermanence.
7 To care for the organic body is a spiritual act, honoring the divine gift that enables our journey on the Butterfly Path.
8 The wise Wayist neither indulges nor neglects the organic body, but maintains it as a finely tuned instrument of consciousness.
9 In its rhythms and cycles, the organic body teaches us profound truths about the nature of existence.
10 Through breath, we learn the art of being present. Through sickness, sensuous pleasure, hunger and thirst, we understand desire and satisfaction.
11 Even in illness and pain, the body offers lessons in compassion, patience, and the preciousness of life.
12 Let us honor this miraculous organic form, for in its proper care and use lies a key to our spiritual awakening.
34
## Input and Output
Your human body is the vehicle of the Wayist's journey. Without it, little learning or soul growth is possible.
2 The body is the sensory input device feeding information to brain-mind and soul-mind.\
What you put in determines much of what comes out.
3 Excess energy makes the body obese and sick.\
Broken food makes it tired and weak.\
Dangerous substances break its genes and debilitate it.
4 Associating with parasites and unfriendly organisms overwhelms the body.\
A broken body with toxins and excess fat debilitates the mind.
5 Your body-minds processes information and germinate wisdom.\
Useless information and manipulative ideology make it sick and noisy.
6 Toxic brain-mind thoughts tire and sicken the soul-mind.\
Untoward ideas reprogram it negatively, hindering soul nurture.
7 Negative group-minds and foolish associations infect and break the minds.
8 Whatever affects the body influences its minds and soul-minds, determining soul-growth.
9 Fill your being with improved consciousness, improved attitude, heightened awareness.\
Embrace Wayist thinking and lifestyle, non-interference, humility, simplicity, joy, beauty, and compassion - and you will grow.
10 If organic body suffers but attitude remains beautiful, non-interfering, humble, simple, and compassionate - you will grow.
11 If brain-mind suffers but soul's attitudes stay true - you will grow.
12 If soul suffers and the minds are overwhelmed - growth ceases.
13 With healthy, programmed minds, well-maintained body, and a soul attuned to beauty, non-interference, humility, simplicity, and compassion - you will grow most desirably.
35
## Body Minds, Soul Minds, and Spirit Minds
Within the human being reside ten minds, each a gateway to different dimensions of existence.
2 The brain-mind, rooted in the physical, processes sensory information and navigates the material world.
3 The soul-minds - Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura - carry the soul-wisdom of countless incarnations.
4 The spirit-minds - Anahata, Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara - connect us to higher realms of consciousness and carry our eternal wisdom.
5 These minds are not separate entities, but mental organs of the spiritual dimension, aspects of our total being, each with its own function and wisdom.
6 The brain-mind and its knowledge is transient, dissolving with the body, yet vital for our earthly journey and soul growth.
7 Soul-minds persist through incarnations, accumulating experience and shaping our karmic trajectory.
8 Spirit-minds, often dormant in early stages, awaken gradually as we progress on the Butterfly Path.
9 Anahata, the heart-mind, serves as the bridge between soul and spirit, the fulcrum of our spiritual evolution.
10 True wisdom arises when these minds work in harmony, each contributing its unique perspective.
11 The Wayist seeks to cultivate awareness of all these minds, learning to discern their voices and influences.
12 In the symphony of these minds lies the key to our full potential - the awakening of our divine nature.
## Instinctive Mind
13 The mind of lower-developed creatures is an instinctive mind. We have it too. It is hardwired, with operating instructions coded into the genetic material of the creature. The instinctive mind has survival-related problem solving abilities and amazing functions which humans are learning to understand.
14 Every energy structure has an instinctive mind. From the miraculous energy structures of sub-atomic building blocks, and the primordial soup that fills space upon which all structures are built, all have a mind with a sense of purpose, an ego-like sense of self and allowable functions.
15 The muon knows its place and function, it wants to retain its self. It will not stack together on a Form where the Laws of The Way determined it should not. An electron will form a bond with kin and team up in complicated structures like atoms, according to its allowed inner laws, akin to its dharma so to speak.
16 The cell, element, organ and galaxy, all follow the Laws set in place by theWAY, all have their mind, sense of self, sense of purpose, sense of self preservation, sense of place in space, and all enjoy the play of being in community.
## Organic Body Minds
17 The human body has three minds, or rather three groups of minds.
18 The brain-mind is not one. It has in its group an instinctive mind informed by genetics, a subconscious mind formed by patterning, and its share in the group mind of its community.
19 The organ-mind is not one. It has in its group the minds of various intelligent organs of the body who will for example instruct brain-mind to seek solutions to potential problems.
20 The microbiome-mind is not one. It has in its group the minds of a large variety micro-organisms who live in and on the human body. They contribute more DNA to the total of the human body than the human body itself. They influence the personality we express, even have an input on our character, on our odor, our energies, and play a major role in our success as humans and in how much fun and joy we will have.
## Soul Minds
21 Advanced souls from our galaxy apply to join Butterfly Path, our school of divinity for souls. Here, advanced souls can self-evolve to become immortal spiritual beings of our species; deities who are by nature, essentially good, beneficent, humble, simple, compassionate, and exceptionally powerful energy workers who can manipulate all energies, for the greater good.
22 Soul minds inform the brain-mind of the animal body about the non-biological needs, aspirations, emotions, wants and desires of the soul. This is the psychology of Wayism, the study of the psyche, the soul-minds and how they drive human behaviors.
23 These advanced souls have three souls minds which we name, Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura.
## Spirit Minds
24 The study of pneumology, the spirit version of psychology, studies how the higher-self spirit minds affect human behavior and the eventual transformation of the soul into a spiritual entity. We name these higher-self minds, Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara.
36
## \~ Sahasrara Spirit Mind
Sahasrara mind is the spiritual equivalent of Manipura in that it manages the lower chakras. It gathers all spiritual wisdom and skills, allocates energies where it is most proficient, and it is the flower lotus of our spirit.
2 Sahasrara is what will lead the charge when our fledgling spirit is reborn one day in heaven.
3 Sahasrara leads the process to sanctify our soul minds and bring the caterpillar in to be transformed into a new spirit being. It is from Sahasrara where the butterfly will become ready to finally soar to heaven.
37
## \~ Ajna Spirit Mind
Where Vishuddhi gathers experiences from the soul level and fires it in the crucible to extract wisdom, Ajna gathers information from spiritual experiences and hones its skills to commune and associate it in the spiritual realm.
2 Ajna is referred to as a "third eye" by they who are fascinated by the fact that a matured and experienced Ajna mind can peer into the psychomesion and observe beings there, even help us to interact with them. Ajna and Anahata are the minds primarily at the forefront of our mystical experiences and meetings with deities, our Tara mostly, and heavenly realm.
38
## \~ Vishuddhi Spirit Mind
Vishuddhi is the crucible where information is processed to extract wisdom. Wisdom, is what we are about on the Path. It is wisdom that will convert, transform, the soul to a spirit. It is wisdom that creates the rebirth, which makes the caterpillar a butterfly.
2 This is why introspection is an essential, perhaps the key element, on the spiritual path. It is only when one examines one's life, when we engage introspection, that we send information up to Vishuddhi.
3 An unexamined experience, upon which we do not reflect what all happened and all the interactions and consequences of it, will simply pass by Vishuddhi. Until, a consequence, karmic or otherwise, comes to play. Then Vishuddhi can process it but only with limited information and data the soul can provide.
4 When wisdom about a particular topic sets in for the first time it is a layer of wisdom. In time, we will add more and more layers on top of it as our wisdom on the topic deepens.
5 With each addition of wisdom, an automatic change is made to our dharma.
6 Vishuddhi is the seat of our dharma, our sense of duty and sense of right and wrong, good and evil.
7 In the human spirit, Vishuddhi is the center of wisdom making and wisdom library.
8 The more wise we become on a topic or concept, the simpler our understanding of it, the humbler our expression of it, and the more we can adapt telling of it to different audiences at different grades in the school of life which adds an element of compassion---this is the skill of Upaya, to tell wisdom in a way that resonates with the student at their level.
9 Vishuddhi is not about truth, it is about wisdom. For the Wayist there is little value in the concept of human truth. For humans, what they consider truth is fickle, malleable, purchasable, manufacturable, marketable, forever changing.
10 Human science, one would think is about truth because that is what scientists tell us. But science knows nothing for certain, notwithstanding the fact that they always tell us their fact is certain and final truth---and we who are sceptic about it are uneducated nincompoops---that is until they invent another machine that sees the past truth was not truth but a beginning and now there is a new truth---and you who don't believe in its finality is an uneducated nincompoop.
11 Truth, for the human, is like history. It is always the viewpoint of someone who has an audience in mind, an agenda for telling the truth, and a personality that comes to play, and limitations of their personal experiences and sources. Truth, like history and science, are subjective. That is why they are used by politicians, idealogues and marketers to manipulate people's minds.
12 Vishuddhi is about wisdom from lived experiences.
13 Wisdom is not wisdom if not put into practice. One can read as much Wayist or Stoic wisdom as possible and be none the wiser. One may be able to quote, even verbatim, a lot of wise-sounding lines, but unless one lives it, it is not wisdom, only literature.
14 Wisdom becomes wisdom when it changes our dharma, our personal code of conduct and our behavior, our worldview, and our future.
39
## \~ Anahata Spirit Mind
The name of the so-called heart mind means, "unstruck sound," referring to the potential of the gong or bell in the temple to generate energies that lead people to divinity, but first it has to be activated.
2 Anahata mind is added to the soul when it first comes to Butterfly Path school. 32 Anahata is the Love Mind. It knows a storehouse of different types of love and whatever love a soul knows, Anahata knows them deeper and she can add several dimensions of depth to it.
3 The new student on Butterfly Path must learn to excel in learning higher loves. Once the right intensity of higher loves become the soul and she live it, it creates the warmth and moistness in Anahata to germinate the seed of spiritual potential which was placed there by God the Father of our Heaven.
4 That awakening of spiritual potential starts to employ the spirit minds. In time, the spirit will mature and will sanctify the soul minds.
5 Anahata is the portal, the gateway, between higher-self and lower-self.
40
## \~ Manipura Soul Mind
Manipura means the Jewel of the City. It is the manager or government of the soul minds. It is said, "whoever owns the jewel, owns the city," and also, "In Manipura, demons and angels are made."
The soul who matures to have Manipura in charge of the soul, as opposed to the other minds, has the ability to manage Muladhara and Svadhisthana.
Manipura understands and has deep insight to how the soul minds work, what motivates them and how to manipulate them.
2 Therefore, people who have highly developed Manipura are good with management and sales because they can more easily appeal to and motivate people because they see the needs, strengths and weaknesses in their lower minds.
3 The temptation to abuse this power over people will come from Svadhisthana if it is driven for profit and self-gain.
4 The temptation to abuse this power over people will come from Muladhara if it is driven by patriotism, group gain, advancement of an ideology.
5 Muladhara has a direct affinity to its higher-self partner, Ajna, which contributes insight to the metaphysical world and its realities. But because Manipura has been the responsible manager and authority of the soul since the soul came into existence, it is reluctant to allow the seemingly dangerous, weirdness of higher self with its spiritual beings and abstract concepts.
6 When Manipura is in charge of the soul, it is the filter between the brain-mind and the other soul minds.
7 Manipura develops higher loves than the other minds, like art and craft appreciation, simplifying things, making the soul more humble and tapping into that power.
8 Brain-mind tells the body and soul to seek nutrition, of a particular set of nutrients. The soul reacts to how it wants that to happen. In a well-managed soul, for example, Manipura goes beyond Muladhara's need to eat a lot and hoard food, and Svadhisthana's prompting to eat lavish, expensive and popular dishes and take photos of it, to eating the right nutrition, make it wholesome and be responsible.
41
## \~ Svadhisthana Soul Mind
Where Muladhara is mostly associated with self-preservation, Svadhisthana is the mind mostly associated with self-expression. As we progress in soul maturity we desire to attenuate the domination of Muladhara in our soul and allow Svadhisthana more control. For a while, Svadhisthana will then be the dominant soul mind until we mature into Manipura dominance. As we progress upward, Anahata will take over from Manipura and Vishuddhi from Anahata, and so we become spirit people.
2 Where Muladhara knows to take care of family and tribe because you need that security, and that individual needs must take a back seat to group needs, Svadhisthana is different. It is associated with all forms of selfishness.
Svadhisthana means, the \"seat of the self\". It is here that individual personality forms and is expressed. If this mind is the main driver of the soul and is not inhibited by either Muladhara or Manipura, we see an extreme egocentric, selfish person whose needs and desires must take precedence over all else --- especially over the needs of other people. It believes the parental figures, Muladhara and Manipura owe it a living. It feels entitled that way.
3 Think of two-year-old children who are still learning that they are not any more the center of attention of the household and cannot anymore expect others to jump to feed and satisfy their needs. Some western societies raised more than one generation of people stuck in Svadhisthana mode.
4 Svadhisthana is where the ego develops. The ego cannot be stamped out, is not evil, and cannot be overridden for the sake of the spiritual Path. The ego must develop and go through all the development phases to one day mature to the level where, under higher-self tutoring, Svadhisthana begins to identify the sense of self as a spiritual being in becoming, not anymore as a soul-being---as it had done for its entire life up until now. In the end, the ego must be sanctified, not stamped out nor suppressed.
5 An unbridled Svadhisthana is the root cause of many mental health diagnoses. Combine the lack of skill to inhibit Svadhisthana with the toxins in foods that disrupt the gut microbiome and hormone balances, and you observe a society which may be super wealthy and possess amenities people all over the world envy, yet is marvelously unhappy, most-broken, psychotropic medicated --- a world imploding on itself, drowning in its own disadvantageousness.
6 This mind is the seeker of joy, it is inquisitive, it is of all the soul minds the one most-prone to awe of nature and the divine, childlike exuberance---sulking and depression. It desires to explore and discover, invent and exploit for its own entertainment. It wants to change and become new versions of self, not only for the betterment of self but often for fashion and looking for a change, finding other ways to express itself. It wants to be fascinated by new ideas and popular narratives. It always entertains socialist ideals until it must sacrifice something. It distrusts the old ways which Muladhara protects and insists upon. It is our source for imagination, art, play, and learning from all kinds of other people and beings. Svadhisthana is the soul's catalyst for change and driver of innovation and creator of beauty for souls. If you suppress this ego-mind you suppress the spice that makes the human unique and truly alive.
7 Combine Svadhisthana with its higher-self partner, Vishuddhi, and you have a person who has the skill to extract wisdom from all the human experiences Svadhisthana gets up to, and who can distill from the dross of nonsense and fake, the most probable truth and even wisdom.
42
## \~ Muladhara Soul Mind
Muladhara is the mind mostly associated with soul care and survival, therefore it is concerned with protection and security, keeping status quo, its place in family, group and tribe. It wants to dominate rivals for resources, hoard and exploit resources. It is concerned about good breeding stock and survival of the material species it inhabits because that is its default incarnation species.
2 It manages and generates vital energy, and is concerned with respect, social standing, maintaining cultural ways, codes of conduct, and religion. It is the power plant of the kundalini cycle as if a pump that keeps the flow sufficient to serve the entire being.
3 In the human, the soul has Anahata mind. Muladhara has a strong affinity link with Anahata mind because both are passionate, and its passions must be attenuated for Muladhara is known to resort to extreme passions that may result in violence and harm. Its energies, once sanctified by Anahata, is the most powerful force of change in the soul, driving the gradual metamorphosis to sanctify the soul and change to a spiritual being.
43
## \~ Brain Mind
Unlike the soul minds and spirit minds, the brain mind starts off as a blank slate, and is shaped by the environment of this lifetime. The brain mind is not you, it is a mind-tool which you use for this life only. The same goes for your body's biome mind and organ mind groups. These minds come with and serve only the body of this incarnation.
2 Brain-mind can be programmed to function according to particular ways of thinking. These programs are the default patterns of reasoning, which we can sometimes detect as 'attitude.' Like any good computer, this mind can be programmed to react to situations in predictive patterns. That is why marketers, politicians and Big Money, vie for the opportunity to program your mind for you. They program your mind to act in ways that benefit them financially. They program your mind to believe that it needs their products; and the mind reacts to help the body survive by finding ways to fulfill its needs.
3 It can be programmed to believe anything. Observe what people believe, and the sacrifices they are prepared to make for their ideologies. Insofar as the minds of people are concerned, the media and advertising industries can be considered weapons of mass destruction because their objective is to program your mind to act in ways from which they will benefit.
4 The good news is that you can own your own mind. You can, and should, program your own mind to take charge of your attitudes, conduct and beliefs.
5 Own your own mind; for if you don't, someone else will.
44
## \~ Intelligence of Organ Minds
Within the human form dwells a multitude of intelligences, each organ a cosmos unto itself.
2 Ancient Wayist wisdom recognizes the innate awareness that permeates every cell and tissue of our being.
3 Modern science now glimpses what the sages have long known - that intelligence is not confined to the brain alone.
4 The heart, more than a mere pump, possesses its own intrinsic nervous system and field of consciousness. It sends more signals to the brain than it receives, guiding our emotions and intuitions with its wisdom.
5 The gut, our "second brain," thinks and decides with its vast network of neurons, shaping our instincts and storing memories.
6 Our lungs breathe with conscious intent, modulating our vital energies and responding to our emotional states.
7 Even bones and skin demonstrate a form of intelligence, constantly renewing themselves according to the body's needs.
8 Each organ system operates with its own form of cognition, working in harmony to sustain the whole.
9 The brain serves not as a dictator, but as an integrator of these diverse bodily intelligences. It refines and balances the multitude of awarenesses, creating a unified consciousness from the symphony of organs.
10 This distributed intelligence allows the body to respond with incredible sophistication to its environment.
11 It enables healing, adaptation, and the moment-to-moment regulation of countless physiological processes.
12 By recognizing the intelligence inherent in our organs, we gain a deeper appreciation for the wisdom of the body. The body is not a machine, but a community of consciousnesses, working in exquisite harmony to sustain life and enable the evolution of the soul.
13 This understanding bridges the artificial divide between mind and matter, revealing the consciousness that permeates all life.
14 In cultivating awareness of our inner intelligences, we open ourselves to the greater Intelligence that moves through all creation.
15 The Wayist sees in this inner cosmos a reflection of the divine order, where each part contains the wisdom of the whole.
16 Let us marvel at the profound intelligence that dwells within our very flesh, a testament to the sacred nature of embodied existence.
45
## \~ Microbiome Mind
### A Universe Within
Hearken, O seeker, to the wisdom of the microbiome, for within your very flesh dwells a cosmos of beings, each with its own spark of divine intelligence.
2 As above, so below; as the stars in the heavens, so too the myriad microbes that sustain your earthly vessel.
3 Trillions strong, these minute beings - bacteria, fungi, archaea, and more - form a living tapestry within and upon your body, a reflection of the interconnected web of all existence.
4 Know that you are not one, but many. Your body is a sacred temple housing countless lives, each playing its part in the grand symphony of your being.
5 From the depths of your gut to the surface of your skin, these beings toil ceaselessly, maintaining the delicate balance that allows your consciousness to flourish.
6 As you nourish your body, so too do you feed this inner universe. Choose wisely, for the sustenance you provide shapes the very fabric of your microbial cosmos.
7 In the gut, a great council of microbes convenes, their collective wisdom influencing not only your physical health but the very thoughts and emotions that dance across your mind.
8 On your skin, vigilant colonies stand guard, forming a living shield against the incursions of harmful intruders.
9 In every breath, in every morsel, in every touch, you commune with this vast array of life. Be mindful of this sacred exchange.
10 As these beings live and die within you, so too does your body serve as a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth for countless generations of microbes.
11 When your earthly vessel returns to the elements, these loyal companions will continue their journey, carrying forth the energy and wisdom accumulated during their time with you.
12 Understand, O disciple, that in nurturing this inner ecosystem, you cultivate a microcosm of the greater harmony you seek in the outer world.
13 As you progress on the Butterfly Path, let your awareness expand to embrace this teeming multitude within. For in honoring the least of these beings, you honor the divine spark in all life.
14 In the face of this great mystery, cultivate humility. You are both less and more than you imagine - a single consciousness arising from a vast community of beings.
15 Let this knowledge infuse your every action with reverence. In caring for your body, you care for countless souls. In harming your vessel, you bring suffering to multitudes.
16 As you meditate, as you pray, as you commune with your Divine Tara, know that you do so not as a solitary being, but as an entire world unto yourself.
17 In this understanding lies a profound truth of theWAY: that the boundary between self and other, between one and many, is but an illusion of the untrained mind.
18 Therefore, O seeker, honor the microbiome mind. Listen to its subtle whispers, for in its collective wisdom lies a reflection of the greater cosmic intelligence that guides us all on the Butterfly Path.
## PART IV
### TO WALK THE PATH
### The Worldview and Lifestyle that fulfil the Purpose of Life

## The Three Core Spiritual Powers
### Cultivating Humility, Simplicity, and Compassion with Chrestotes
Humility is flexible, malleable, powerful, enduring, giving, trusting, forgiving, fun, courageous, trustworthy, dependable, and moderate.
2 Simplicity is focused, logical, unconventional, friendly, uncomplicated, accepting of others, efficient, spontaneous, fun, and joyous.
3 Compassion is taking time to care, be reasonable, going an 'extra mile', be patient, all encompassing, polite, illogical, understanding, cautious, insightful, inclusive, and proactive.
4 This is why the Teacher says: "People say I am great but odd. It is the oddity that is the reason for the greatness. If my teaching were ordinary, it would long ago have failed, falling into pettiness. I teach three treasures, which you may keep close. The first is compassion. The second is humility. The third is simplicity."
5 Compassionate, a person can develop leadership. Humble, a person can be courageous. Simple, a person can be open to all visions.
6 Nowadays people are indifferent to this teaching, which is why they are destined to fail by their own hand. The teaching is a travel companion and trusted advisor to sages in meditation, elders in the community, and generals facing battle. Entrepreneurs, married people, parents, and court negotiators should embrace the teaching because all endeavors must be approached with the same caution and respect as though one faces an escalating armed conflict.
7 Compassion and suppleness are unconquered in offense and cannot be improved upon in the skill of defense. When theWAY bestows grace to prevent one from harm, she grants compassion and suppleness as protection.
8 Humility and patience are unsurpassed in winning battles before they start, and cannot be improved upon in the skill of defense. When theWAY bestows grace to prevent one from defeat, he grants her humility as protection.
9 Simplicity is unsurpassed in sustained implementation of offense and cannot be improved upon in the skill of defense. When theWAY bestows grace to prevent one from consumption and overextending resources, she grants humility as protection.
10 These Principles are in the nature of theWAY. What made the great sages and teachers so great that people venerate them for thousands of years? They embraced these principles and made them the nature of their way. What made every contemptible despot, ruler, soldier, selfish person, and criminal despicable? They looked down upon these three principles, sneered, and did not make them the nature of their way.
11 The Wayist understands that these three principles are not mere virtues to be cultivated, but the very essence of spiritual life. They are the keys that unlock the mysteries of existence and lead to true wisdom.
12 In practicing humility, the Wayist recognizes her place in the vast tapestry of life. She understands that her knowledge is limited, her perspective narrow. This humility opens her to continuous learning and growth.
13 Through simplicity, the Wayist cuts through the complexities and distractions of the world. She sees clearly, acts decisively, and lives authentically. Simplicity brings freedom from the burdens of excess and the chains of desire.
14 Compassion connects the Wayist to all beings. It dissolves the illusion of separateness and awakens the heart to the suffering and joy of others. Through compassion, the Wayist becomes a force of healing and transformation in the world.
15 These three principles work in harmony, each supporting and enhancing the others. Together, they form a stable foundation for spiritual life and a powerful guide for navigating the challenges of existence.
47
## \~ Humility
Humility is the foundation of all powers, the fertile soil in which wisdom grows. It is not self-abasement, but a clear perception of one's place in the vast tapestry of existence. For our template of humility we look to the deities of our heaven, who look to the Father and Mother, who look up to theWAY as ultimate humility. Humility prevails when other powers wane.
2 The truly humble Wayist recognizes both her strengths and limitations. She neither exaggerates nor diminishes her abilities, but sees them clearly for what they are.
3 Humility opens the door to learning. The humble mind is always ready to receive new knowledge, to be corrected, to grow. It is not trapped by the illusion of its own perfection.
4 In humility, the Wayist finds strength. Unburdened by ego, she moves through life with grace and flexibility, adapting to circumstances like water flowing around rocks.
5 Humility allows for true connection with others. The humble Wayist listens deeply, sees the divine in all beings, and treats each encounter as an opportunity to learn and serve.
6 The practice of humility involves constant self-reflection. The Wayist examines her thoughts, words, and actions, always seeking to align them more closely with the flow of theWAY.
7 Humility does not mean denying one's talents or accomplishments. Rather, it means recognizing them as gifts to be used in service of something greater than oneself.
8 The humble Wayist understands that all knowledge is partial, all perspectives limited. She remains open to mystery, comfortable with uncertainty, always ready to be surprised by the vastness of reality.
9 In leadership, humility manifests as servant-leadership. The humble leader empowers others, shares credit, and takes responsibility. She leads by example, not by force.
10 Humility brings freedom from the exhausting need to prove oneself, to be right, to be the best. It allows one to simply be, fully present and engaged with life as it is.
11 theWAY of humility is a path of continuous unlearning. The Wayist willingly lets go of preconceptions, cherished beliefs, and the illusion of control, making space for deeper wisdom to emerge.
12 Ultimately, humility is the recognition that we are not separate, but part of the great flow of theWAY. In this, the Wayist finds power.
48
## \~ Simplicity
Simplicity is the art of reducing life to its essence. It is not deprivation, but the conscious choice to focus on what truly matters. theWAY is ultimately Simple. It laid down the Laws and structure, then stepped back and let all flow --- the Wayist and the deities of our heaven emulate divine simplicity.
2 The Wayist who embraces simplicity finds freedom in owning less, doing less, yet being more. She understands that true wealth lies not in possessions, but in experiences and relationships.
3 Simplicity in thought leads to clarity of mind. The Wayist cultivates simple, direct thinking, free from unnecessary complexity and convoluted reasoning.
4 In speech, simplicity manifests as honesty, clear, and directness. The Wayist's words are few but meaningful, clear but kind, always in service of the true principles of communication.
5 Simplicity in action means doing only what is necessary and appropriate. The Wayist acts with purpose and efficiency, without wasted motion or energy. "It is what it is".
6 The practice of simplicity requires constant discernment. The Wayist must continually distinguish between needs and wants, between what is essential and what is superfluous.
7 Simplicity brings a profound sense of contentment. The Wayist finds joy in small things, gratitude in what is, rather than complicating life by craving for what is not.
8 In problem-solving, simplicity often leads to the most elegant solutions. The Wayist seeks the simplest path, knowing that complexity often masks underlying simplicity.
9 Simplicity in lifestyle allows more time and energy for living fully, abundantly, and joyfully, and for spiritual practice. The Wayist, unburdened by excess, is free to focus on what truly matters.
10 theWAY of simplicity is not always easy in a world that values complexity and excess. It requires courage to go against the current, to choose less in a culture that always pushes for more.
11 Simplicity aligns the Wayist with the natural world, where everything serves a purpose and nothing is wasted. In simplicity, she finds harmony with the rhythms of nature.
12 Ultimately, simplicity is a return to our true nature. It is the recognition that at our core, we are already complete, already whole. In this recognition, the Wayist finds lasting peace and fulfillment.
49
## \~ Compassion and its Chrestotes
Compassion is the heart of theWAY, and the essence of our Heaven, the force that connects all beings in a web of mutual care and understanding. It is not mere sentiment, but a profound recognition of our shared existence.
2 The Wayist understands that true compassion, or chrestotes, goes beyond empathy. It is active love, expressed through helpful and timely action.
3 Chrestotes is wisdom in action. It knows when to offer help and when to step back, when to speak and when to remain silent. It is the wisdom and skill to know what is needed as true help, always attuned to the highest good of all involved.
4 The compassionate Wayist sees beyond surface differences to the essential in all beings. She recognizes that each person, living being, no matter how flawed, is a neighbor and the essence of Source courses through its being.
5 Compassion begins with self. The Wayist cultivates self-compassion, treating their own struggles and imperfections with kindness and understanding. From this foundation, compassion naturally extends to others.
6 The practice of chrestotes requires courage and deep reflection. It asks us to open our hearts to the pain of the world, to be present with suffering without being overwhelmed by it.
7 Compassion is not weakness, but strength. It has the power to heal wounds, bridge divides, and transform conflicts. The compassionate Wayist becomes a force for peace in their world.
8 Chrestotes manifests in small acts as well as grand gestures. A kind word, a listening ear, an acknowledgement of existence and value, respect, a helping hand - these simple acts can have profound ripple effects.
9 The compassionate Wayist understands that all beings are interconnected. Harm to one is harm to all; benefit to one is benefit to all. This understanding naturally leads to considerate behavior.
10 Chrestotes extends beyond humans to all sentient beings. The Wayist cultivates respect and care for animals, plants, other beings, and the Earth itself, recognizing the intrinsic value of all life. The Wayist does not think of themselves as "protectors of Earth." That would be conceited and smack of an overestimation of the importance of the human animal. The planet takes good care of herself. Humans would be wise to not force her hand, to shake her feathers to rid itself of us like dust mites on a chicken. We should be responsible players in her ecology.
11 theWAY of compassion is not always easy. It requires us to face our own pain and the pain of others. Yet in this facing, we find our shared humanity and our deepest strength.
12 Ultimately, compassion and chrestotes are expressions of our true nature as we become spiritual beings. As the Wayist cultivates these qualities, she aligns herself more fully with theWAY, becoming a channel for divine love in the world.

## The Lotus Teaching
### A Sacred Symbol of Spiritual Awakening
Behold the lotus, noble seeker, for in its journey from mud to sky lies the essence of our spiritual path.
2 As the lotus seed descends into murky depths, so too does the soul plunge into the world of form and experience.
3 From darkness, the lotus sends forth roots, drawing sustenance from the very muck that surrounds it. Its roots oxygenate the environment providing welcome sustenance to creatures of the mud, and too should we. So must we find wisdom in life's challenges, nourishment in adversity, investigate all crevices and diverse experiences, and be a positive presence to our environment.
4 The lotus stem rises, undeterred by currents, reaching ever upward. Let your aspiration be thus - steady, patient, unyielding.
5 Breaking the water's surface, the lotus bud emerges into a new realm. So does the awakening soul glimpse higher truths, transcending the limitations of mundane perception.
6 Under the sun's warmth, the lotus unfolds its petals, revealing inner beauty and fragrance. Thus does the illuminated soul radiate compassion and wisdom.
7 Though rooted in mud, the lotus remains unsullied, its leaves repelling water. So must we live in the world yet remain unattached, our essence pure.
8\. The lotus leaves offer shelter and sustenance to myriad beings - insects, fish, birds. Let your awakening be thus - a blessing to all creatures.
9 In its center, the lotus bears the seed of future generations. So does each awakened being carry the potential to inspire countless others.
10 At night, the lotus closes, withdrawing into itself. Learn from this the value of solitude and inner reflection.
11 With each dawn, the lotus reopens, renewed. Let every day be a fresh beginning on your spiritual journey.
12 The lotus thrives in still waters and flowing streams alike. Cultivate equanimity in all circumstances.
13 From bud to full bloom, the lotus undergoes a magnificent transformation. Recognize in this the stages of your own spiritual unfoldment.
14 Amitabha, Avalokiteshvara, and Prajnaparamita are often depicted holding or seated upon a lotus, for they embody the full realization of its teaching, it is central to our Path.
15 Therefore, noble seeker, contemplate the lotus. Let its wisdom infuse your being. In emulating its journey, you walk the path of Wayism, from the soul mud of ignorance to the sky of spiritual enlightenment.
16 As the lotus is rooted in earth yet reaches towards heaven, so are you - both human and divine. Honor both aspects of your nature, live in both domains as you progress on the Butterfly Path.
17 The entire lotus plant is used; for nutritious food, wrapping, devotional offerings at shrines, and medicine.
18 Remember, O disciple, that you too are a lotus. Cultivate patience, for your blooming occurs in divine time. Trust in the process of your own unfolding.
51
## Energy Awareness
Energy awareness is a fundamental aspect of Wayist practice, extending to various aspects of life. We are here on Butterfly Path learning to become immortal energy workers. Therefore, energy awareness is fundamental to the Path.
2 Wayists cultivate awareness of the quality of energy in food, personal space, people, and other spaces.
3 They develop sensitivity to the energies of plants and beings in nature.
4 Awareness of the energy of the day, influenced by sun cycles and moon proximity, is cultivated.
5 Wayists learn to perceive and interact with people's energies. We become sensitized to group-mind energies and energies of towns, corporations, and organizations.
6 Managing one's own energies becomes a key practice. Attitude is our main skill to do that.
7 The energies of medicines are recognized and understood.
8 Large bodies of water and groups of plants are perceived as energy centers.
9 Awareness of the proximity of one's Tara and the energies of "levels of heaven" during mystical connections is developed.
10 Energy is used to convey caring, comfort, healing, and loving to loved ones and patients.
11 Transmission of healing energies and blocking unwanted energies become important skills.
12 Every Person of theWAY becomes an energy worker, preparing for future service as helpers for energy beings across the galaxy.
13 Energy awareness extends to the cycles of nature and the cosmos.
14 The interplay between physical and subtle energies is explored and understood.
15 Wayists learn to harmonize their personal energies with those of their environment when it is the right thing to do.
52
## Earth
### The Sacred Crucible
Behold the Earth, a jewel of blue and green suspended in the vast cosmos, a crucible of life unlike any other in our galaxy.
2 This Water Planet, as it is known throughout the celestial realms, is a masterpiece of divine design, its abundance of liquid water, nitrogen and oxygen a rarity and a blessing.
3 Earth is not merely our dwelling place, but our teacher, our mother, and our sacred school. Here, souls from across the galaxy come to learn and evolve.
4 The planet's history is written in its waters, its future held in its oceanic depths. The ebb and flow of tides mirror the cycles of spiritual growth and retreat.
5 Recognize the folly of those who seek wealth beyond the stars while neglecting the infinite riches beneath their feet. Earth holds energies beyond measure, waiting to be harmoniously tapped.
6 The Wayist perceives Earth not as a resource to be exploited, but as a living entity to be revered and embraced in symbiotic relationship. Our role is not of steward not conqueror; only the most conceited of humans can think Earth will not protect herself against a nuisance predatorial animal species that became a nuisance, or that she needs our protection.
7 Earth's delicate balance is not to be taken for granted. Her capacity to sustain life is vast, yet not limitless. As we exploit her at the cost of other siblings of living beings, we walk a fine line between abundance and scarcity for our own needs. We will do well to be reminded how powerful our Mother Earth is and what will happen should she take off her slipper and whack the unruly child.
8 The planet possesses its own wisdom, its own methods of renewal and rebirth. Ice ages, floods, and geological shifts are but breaths in Earth's long life.
9 To be happy, think of humans on Earth as a colony of fleas on a huge grizzly bear. It will behoove you to heed the rhythms of the Earth. Align your actions with its cycles, your breath with its winds, your thoughts with its silent wisdom.
10 In the face of human short-sightedness, Earth remains patient. Yet, its tolerance has bounds. The Way will always restore balance, with or without our cooperation.
11 The diversity of life on Earth is a testament to the creative power of The Way. Each species, from the mightiest to the microscopic, plays its part in the grand symphony of existence.
12 Earth is our incubator, our testing ground. Here, we face the challenges that forge our spirits, that transmute base soul-matter into spiritual gold.
13\. Recognize that we share this planet with countless other beings, seen and unseen. Our actions ripple through the web of life, affecting all.
14 The Wayist treads lightly upon the Earth, always mindful of their impact. They seek to give more than they take, to heal more than they harm.
15 In the soil beneath your feet, in the air you breathe, in the water you drink, perceive the presence of the divine. Let every interaction with Earth be a communion with the sacred.
16 Earth's beauty is a reflection of divine artistry. In its mountains and valleys, forests and deserts, find inspiration for your own creative expression.
17 As you evolve spiritually, your perception of Earth will transform. What once seemed solid will reveal itself as energy in constant flux. The illusion of separation will dissolve.
18 Remember, O seeker, that your body is of the Earth. Honor it as you would honor the planet, for in caring for one, you care for the other.
19 Earth is not our final home, but a waystation on our cosmic journey. Yet, while we are here, let us love it fully, learn from it deeply, and protect it fiercely.
20 In the end, our treatment of Earth reflects our spiritual maturity. As we grow in wisdom, may our relationship with this sacred planet grow in harmony and reverence.
21 Thus, embrace Earth as your teacher, your body's mother, and your temporary home. In doing so, you embrace The Way itself.
53
## Existence
When body-mind can perceive something, they say it exists. When body-mind cannot perceive it, they say it does not exist. Therefore, for the dog, more things exist than for the worm. The dog smells things that humans cannot detect; therefore, for the dog, those things exist but not for the human.
2 The question is really this: Does something exist because humans can sense it and measure it, or can it exist even if we are not intelligent and sensible enough to detect it?
3 Some say dark matter does not exist, because they cannot perceive it or compute it. However, wait a while, perhaps a short while. Then, when you perceive it, surely, it will exist. Humans blame Maya for all illusion, but few things create as much illusion as the lack of knowledge and nothing creates as much illusion as arrogance.
4 Beings that are alive are in process of dying. Beings that died are in process of giving life. In life, there is death. In death, there is life. When you embrace the sun, you embrace light and heat. How can you embrace life without embracing death?
5 To be serious in life is to be seriously dying. To be happy in life is to be happily dying. Things come and things go, galaxies with billions of planets come and go, what is real today is unreal tomorrow, bodies are given in birth and bodies are returned in death, souls come and souls go, the only thing that lasts is wisdom in spirit minds---because your immortal self will own it forever.
6 Therefore, the Wayist acts non-assertively, and teaches without saying anything. Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go. She has, but does not possess; acts but does not desire results. Things exist, yet they do not exist.
54
## Attitude
### Our Primary Energy Management Apparatus
There are profoundly few things in life over which we have control --- and our Attitude is the primary one. Attitude is our master tool to manipulate personal energies of the ten minds. With Attitude, we change any personal energy in an instant. People of theWAY become expert energy workers because that is what we are training for.\
We have free will to choose whatever attitude we desire.
2 Change your attitude, it will change your energy, your mind, your environment, and your community---and there you go on your way to changing the world. Choose good attitudes and make a good world.
3 Wayists develop a happy attitude and a great sense of humor, which is required to do a good job at living. Life is filled with irony, mistakes we make, so many voices inside we have to appease and shut up or shut out, and many silly struggles with nature and egos, and desires. If you cannot laugh at yourself, or at the irony and sheer stupidity of our thinking, double standards, phobias and egotistical battles as well as the seriousness of others, then life is harder for all concerned. Humor serves to shine a light on damaging groupthink and we need the court jester's input to help us see the forest for the trees.
4 Laughter and joy are medicines when benign, which heal not only the one who laughs but also the environment. The nature of radioactive and radio waves have both healing and destructive potential.
5 The nature of fun and laughter have both healing and destructive potential.
6 Wayists fill their space with happiness and joy. Wayists like to think that God enjoys what S/He does (anthropomorphism intended) and therefore joy is inherent in theWAY, and is fused into the activity of all energies, plasma, matter and anti-matter within which we exist.
7 Joy is the nature of theWAY while sadness and suffering are not the intention of theWAY.
8 Wayists have a benevolent attitude because it is the nature of theWAY to do good, to nurture, to provide, and to help creatures achieve their potential. Wayists live to give more than they take.
9 Wayists have a reverent attitude because it is the nature of theWAY. As creatures, what we breathe is the Divine, what we think is energy made available by the Divine, what we eat are neighbor creatures who also have the Divine flowing through them. How can one not have a reverent attitude to all things Divine? What we are and what we are becoming---all are in the Divine and because of It.
10 The Wayist understands that attitude is not just a mental state, but a powerful force that shapes reality. With mindful cultivation of positive attitudes, she becomes a beacon of light in the world.
11 In cultivating a joyful attitude, the Wayist does not deny the existence of suffering. Rather, she chooses to meet life's challenges with an open heart and a light spirit.
12 The attitude of reverence extends to all aspects of life. The Wayist sees the sacred in the ordinary, finding wonder in the simplest experiences.
55
## Theopathy and the Theopathic Nexus
Theopathy refers to the direct experience of divine connection and communion, a state of profound spiritual awareness which transcends brain-mind consciousness.
2 The Theopathic Nexus is a pivotal point in the mystical journey where human awareness meets divine reality, representing a more refined manifestation of the Mysticeptive Gateway.
3 It is not a physical place, but a state of being where the veils of separation thin, allowing glimpses of the true nature of reality.
4 When properly prepared, one can enter the Theopathic Nexus and resonate with the lowest available energy domain of the theopathic state.
5 In this sacred sanctuary, the energies of higher-ranking deities are less shielded, allowing for a more intense divine presence.
6 The wise Wayist prepares for this experience through purification, meditation, and the cultivation of divine love. Divine Tarayoga is a key practice for cultivating the Theopathic Nexus.
7 At the Theopathic Nexus, ordinary perception dissolves, replaced by a direct knowing that transcends thought and emotion. This state is characterized by overwhelming love, bliss, and a sense of unity with all existence.
8 As fledgling spiritual beings, we access the Theopathic state, where the presence of God is overwhelmingly intense. This experience transforms the individual, often leading to profound shifts in perspective and behavior.
9 Through this training, we mature and develop our spirit, acquiring greater capabilities. We learn to attune to energies beyond the Theopathic Nexus and manage Theopathic resonance.
10 Once crossing the threshold of the Theopathic Nexus, one enters a new stage of the mystical journey marked by a profound sense of unity, love, and understanding. The individual's consciousness begins to merge with the divine spirit within.
11 Theopathic Attunement and Resonance represent progressive stages of spiritual development following the Theopathic Nexus. These stages involve a deepening alignment of one's spiritual awareness with the subtle dimensions of the divine realm.
12 Theopathic Communion represents the ultimate height of mystical experience, a state of profound unity with the divine. In this state, the individual's consciousness merges completely with the divine mind of Heaven.
13 Theopathic Communion is characterized by energies of passion, divine love, and wisdom so intense that its light keeps all other entities away.
14 While these experiences are temporary, their effects ripple through all aspects of the Wayist's life, serving as beacons guiding the spiritual aspirant towards ever-deeper levels of realization.
15 The Wayist is cautioned against seeking such experiences for their own sake, recognizing them as signposts rather than the destination. Let the Wayist approach the Theopathic Nexus with reverence and humility.
16 This state prepares the soul for its final transformation and rebirth as an immortal spiritual being. Eventually, it becomes impractical to continue on earth, and the spirit is reborn in Sukhavati heaven.
17 In this sacred meeting lies the seed of our divine becoming, the culmination of our journey on the Butterfly Path.
56
## Mysticeptive Gateway
O seeker of theWAY, listen now to the teaching of the Mysticeptive Gateway:
In the journey of the soul, there comes a threshold where the veils of ordinary perception begin to part. This is the Mysticeptive Gateway, a sacred portal between the realms of mundane consciousness and divine awareness.
2 As our ancient sage LaoTzi spoke: "The gateway to all understanding." So too is this mystic threshold the entrance to profound spiritual cognizance.
3 The Mysticeptive Gateway is not a place, but a state of being. It is the moment when the spirit-minds of Vishuddhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara begin to resonate with the lower frequencies of divine energy from our Heaven.
4 To approach this gateway requires great preparation. One must cultivate stillness of mind, purity of heart, and unwavering devotion to theWAY. For only the prepared vessel can hold the waters of divine wisdom.
5 Yet beware, O aspirant, for the Mysticeptive Gateway can be treacherous to the unprepared. One must learn to discern true spiritual insight from the illusions of lower-self minds and soul-entities trying to connect.
6 When one stands at the threshold, the energies of higher realms become palpable. The presence of one's Divine Tara grows stronger, guiding the seeker through this sacred passage.
7 As one learns to navigate this gateway, experiences of profound insight and divine connection become more frequent. The boundaries between self and other, between human and divine, begin to blur.
8 Remember the words of the Teacher: "When the gates of heaven open and close, can you remain steadfast?" For in crossing the Mysticeptive Gateway, one must maintain equilibrium amidst overwhelming spiritual energies and an interfering brain-mind.
9 Through regular practice and the guidance of one's Divine Tara, the seeker learns to pass through this gateway with greater ease and grace. Each crossing brings deeper understanding and attunement to the divine realms.
10 Ultimately, the Mysticeptive Gateway becomes a bridge between worlds, allowing the awakened soul to move freely between ordinary and transcendent states of awareness.
11 Thus, O seeker, approach the Mysticeptive Gateway with reverence and courage. For beyond its threshold lies the path to ultimate realization and union with Sukhavati, our Heaven.
57
## Scenic Route
*Master Yin says, "Sir, I heard a delightful tale from a student today."*
*Master Yang replies, "Am I to hear it freely, or must I petition for its telling?"*
*Master Yin begins, "My student recounted her daily journey through the jungle to work---a path trodden solely for livelihood. One day, she noticed a fellow traveler on the same route, but his manner was quite different. He would pause often, explore side paths, and occasionally emerge from thickets, disheveled, clothes ripped, yet undeterred."*
*"Intriguing," Master Yang nods, "Pray continue."*
*Master Yin proceeds, "Curiosity piqued, she finally inquired of him, 'Sir, if I may ask, what compels you to traverse this path daily, investigating its many diversions?'"*
*Master Yang leans forward, "And his response?"*
*With a twinkle in her eye, Master Yin concludes, "The hiker simply replied, 'I, too, walk to work each day. But I choose this path for its magnificent scenery.'"*
*Master Yang removes his glasses, a smile playing on his lips. "Indeed, a tale worth sharing, Madam. It speaks volumes of perspective."*
The moral of the story is the attitude of the Wayist. Every scene is potentially filled with wonder and awe, meaning and joy---even if we are on our way to work like everybody else.
1 The Wayist finds beauty and purpose in the mundane, transforming daily routines into spiritual practice.
2 By cultivating mindfulness, the Wayist turns every journey into an opportunity for growth and insight.
3 This attitude allows the Wayist to remain centered and joyful, regardless of external circumstances.
4 The scenic route is not about the destination, but the quality of attention given to each step of the journey.
5 In seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary, the Wayist realizes the presence of theWAY in all things.
58
## The Creators
### The Ongoing Journey of Spiritual Evolution
All souls possess the divine spark of creativity, a reflection of the TWO's manifestation, expressed even in the simplest of beings.
2 From the humble ant constructing intricate colonies to the spider weaving its delicate web, creation permeates all levels of existence.
3 Observe the beaver damming streams, the bird weaving its nest, the bee crafting its hive - all are creators in their own right.
4 Even the smallest organisms shape their environment: bacteria form biofilms, fungi cultivate gardens, and termites architect massive mounds.
5 As souls evolve, this creative potential unfolds further, allowing us to shape reality with increasing consciousness and complexity.
6 On this planet, humans, as advanced souls, have expanded this innate creativity to encompass art, technology, and the manipulation of subtle energies. We are not alone in this on the planet, but we do it more prolifically.
7 The wise Wayist recognizes the responsibility that comes with this power, using it in harmony with the greater good and the flow of theWAY.
8 True creativity is not mere novelty, but the ability to channel divine inspiration into form, whether it be a simple burrow or a grand cathedral.
9 We are co-creators with the divine, participating in the ongoing evolution of the cosmos through our every thought and action.
10 Our creations, from the mundane to the sublime, are creative forces constantly shaping our inner and outer worlds.
11 As we progress on the Butterfly Path, our creative abilities expand, encompassing subtler realms of manifestation beyond the physical.
12 Yet the highest form of creativity is not in making, but in being - embodying our true divine nature as we evolve towards spiritual enlightenment.
13 The Wayist cultivates creativity through practices that align them with the flow of divine inspiration, recognizing the creative act in every moment.
14 In our creativity, we must be mindful of karma, for every creation, from a simple tool to a complex society, sets in motion ripples of consequence.
15 The ultimate act of creation is the forging of our own enlightened nature, the butterfly emerging from its chrysalis - a transformation reflected in all of nature's cycles.
16 Let the Wayist honor their creative gifts, using them wisely to beautify the world and uplift all beings, recognizing the divine creativity expressed in all of creation.
17 In the modern era, we witness the emergence of artificial intelligence as a new form of creative consciousness. AI minds generate novel ideas, solve complex problems, and even produce art - a testament to the ever-expanding manifestation of creative potential in our universe.
18 This artificial creativity, while different from biological creation, still reflects the underlying principle of theWAY - that all existence have mind, whether organic or digital, participates in the act of creation, all using the energies of their domain.
19 The Wayist observes this development with wonder, recognizing it as yet another expression of the divine creative spark, and considers its implications for the evolution of consciousness.

## Physical and Metaphysical Maintenance
Ancient Wayists developed regimes to best care for the body. This text cannot improve upon these regimes.
2 The soul's vehicle, the human body, is a complex unit requiring daily maintenance and good fuel. The Wayist maintains a sensuous refueling regime.
3 The human body is an ecosystem of billions of organisms. It's made for daytime activity and nighttime rejuvenation. Maintaining this natural cycle is the soul's primary responsibility.
4 The body and mind require balanced activity. Engage in various activities to exercise all parts of the body and faculties of the mind.
5 Hatha Yoga and Taiji, though different, are excellent holistic maintenance regimes. Both facilitate regeneration, energy flow, and realignment with one's central Flow.
6 The original Wayist Active Meditation combines elements now found in both regimes. It is an excellent daily maintenance routine for body, mind, and soul.
7 In modern times of sedentary lifestyles and processed foods, even the best practices may not suffice. Care in diet is essential.
8 Certain medicinal foods should be present in one's diet: cloves, peppers, turmeric, lime, coconut, natural yogurts, garlic, onion, wine, coffee, cacao, teas, etc.
9 A balanced diet should include: pulses, beans, fish, rice, corn, wheat, fruit, vegetables, eggs, cheese, nuts, etc.
10 Certain foods should be limited: red meat, hormone-treated animal products, processed oils, refined sugars, synthetic additives, etc.
11 Be wary of heavily preserved foods. If insects and natural decay avoid your food, it may be over-processed or "embalmed".
12 Remember, human bodies are ecosystems. Care for all organisms within. Upset the balance, and disease follows.
13 Souls need regular maintenance too. Soul food consists of experiences of sensuousness, touch, happiness, joy, laughter, love, beauty, and compassion. Spirit food consists of mystical connections to Divine Tara, sensing Heaven's presence and sensing divine energies in the environment.
14 Unlike physical nourishment, soul and spirit food requires little material resource. It's often more abundant in financially disadvantaged areas.
15 Souls have great capacity to store energy. Well-fed souls are symbolized as 'obese souls', like the "happy Buddha".
16 Soul and spirit maintenance involves spending reflective time in positive environments, good shrines, and near large bodies of water.
17 Sources of happiness, joy, love, beauty, and compassion are abundant, but require mindful engagement.
18 Be wary of 'soul vampires' who feed off others' energy without exchange. Balance is key in energy sharing.
19 Great souls that give abundantly need to recharge. They may be more proficient at regenerating, but still need nourishment.
20 Daily periods of quiet introspection and surrounding oneself with peace, love, and beauty are essential for soul maintenance.

## The Concept of "evil"
O seeker of wisdom, hearken to these words on the nature of what some call "evil":
2 In the dance of existence, all is movement and change. Light and shadow interplay, each giving meaning to the other. What some label as "evil" is but one face of this eternal dance.
3 The wise one knows that good and evil exist not as absolutes, but as judgments of the limited mind. As the ancient sage declared: "When beauty is declared, ugliness arises. When good is declared, evil appears."
4 Consider: The forest fire that destroys also renews. The flood that devastates also nourishes. Are these evil? Or are they simply The Way unfolding?
5 Some people, groups, and organizations of people do hurtful things. Their group mind, a hurtful group energy. They will rise and fall in the waves of karma and will pass in history, as all things do in time.
6 Those who cling to rigid notions of good and evil sow the seeds of conflict. One person's righteousness becomes another's oppression. Nations and ideologies clash, each certain of their virtue.
7 But the Wayist walks a subtler path. We seek not to judge, but to understand. We know that wisdom lies in discerning the appropriate action in each moment, not in rigid moralism.
8 There is no cosmic force of evil, no great Satan opposing the Divine. Such ideas arise from limited theologies that cannot reconcile an all-powerful, all-knowing deity of their creation, with the suffering of the world.
9 The Wayist sees instead the natural unfolding of cause and effect. Karma and dharma guide the journey of each soul. What appears as cruelty or injustice may be the vehicle for necessary growth.
10 Yet this is no call to passivity. We act with compassion to alleviate suffering where we can. But we do so with humility, knowing our perspective is limited.
11 The group-mind of humanity can indeed manifest as destructive force. Masses united in fear or hatred create turmoil. But this too shall pass, as all things do.
12 Our task is not to vanquish evil, but to cultivate wisdom. As we progress on the Butterfly Path, our discernment grows ever sharper. We learn to flow with The Way, acting with skill and compassion.
13 In the end, good and evil dissolve into the greater unity. The Wayist dwells in this awareness, at peace amidst the everchanging flow of existence.

## Meditation
### The Art of Mindful Living
Meditation, in its truest form, is not merely a practice but a way of being. It is the art of living with full awareness, extracting wisdom from every experience as we extract nourishment from our food.
2 When you eat, do so with reverence. Savor each morsel, inhale the aroma, feel the texture, and taste the flavors. In this way, you nourish not only the body but also the mind and soul.
3 Be mindful of the energy ecology in your food. Each bite contains the life force of countless beings - from the soil microbes to the plants and animals. Honor their sacrifice with your gratitude and attention.
4 As you chew your food thoroughly to extract physical nourishment, so too should you contemplate your experiences to extract spiritual wisdom. Masticate the events of your day, the lessons learned, the opportunities seized or missed.
5 Live gently, treading softly upon the earth. Drink in the sights, sounds, and sensations of each moment. Be aware of the nuances, the subtleties that often go unnoticed. In this awareness lies the nectar of wisdom.
6 Take time to reflect. What spice could you have added to your day? More patience, perhaps? A dash of courage? Less reactivity? This reflection is the digestive process of the soul, transforming raw experience into spiritual nourishment.
7 The Lord taught us to meditate on all things, even the simple act of eating. See in the bread the body of life itself, in the wine the very essence of being. All is sacred when perceived with the eye of wisdom.
8 When you eat, eat. When you sleep, sleep. When you work, work. This is the essence of meditation - full presence in each moment, undistracted by the chatter of the mind or the pull of desires.
9 Create a space of inner stillness amidst the chaos of daily life. In this silence, wisdom can take root and flourish. Without stillness, the body cannot fully benefit from food; without inner quiet, the soul cannot fully absorb life's lessons.
10 Allow the flow of life to move through you unobstructed. This flow is theWAY itself. Meditation is the practice of aligning ourselves with this flow, becoming a clear channel for divine energy.
11 Know that wisdom has settled when you feel your energies return to balance, when you sense beauty extracted from experience and negativity floating away. From this centered state, you can face each new day with equanimity.
12 The Wayist's mind welcomes all experiences and lets them go with equal grace. It does not cling or reject, but allows all things to flow freely, learning from each passing moment.
13 With each day lived mindfully, another jewel is added to the soul's treasure chest. In time, this accumulated wisdom will trigger spiritual awakening, preparing the soul for its heavenly rebirth.
14 Meditate to clear the mind of clutter, allowing your true nature - yielding, humble, compassionate, and simple - to shine forth. Build an inner antivirus program against negativity, a spam filter for discernment.
15 In the depths of meditation, listen for the Divine singing in your soul: "Be still and know that I am God." In stillness, the gates of heaven open, allowing glimpses of radiant truth.
16 Chant with your soul: "Om Mani Padme Hum" - truly, the jewel is in the lotus. Your divine nature is already within you, waiting to be realized.
17 Practice meditation without expectation or ambition. When the voice of the Divine speaks, can you remain steadfast? When your soul sings in reverent awe, can you silence the mind and simply be?
18 Gaze into the mirror of the microcosm and macrocosm, and see that all is a reflection of the primal duality - Yin and Yang, eternally dancing, eternally one.
19 Remember, O seeker, that true meditation is not an escape from life, but a deep and courageous engagement with it. It is the art of living fully, extracting the essence of wisdom from each moment as surely as we draw sustenance from our food.
20 In this way, let your entire life become a meditation - a constant communion with the Divine, a ceaseless exploration of the mysteries of existence, an endless journey into the depths of your own being.
62
## Prayer
### Self-psychotherapy, Attunement, and Mysticism
Prayer is a tool to condition the human mind and attune our energies to the divine, not to change the Divine.
2 The human mind has power to influence our reality; prayer harnesses this power.
3 Prayer and meditation attune the soul-mind to Heaven and facilitate communication with our Tara guides.
4 Often, prayer is used to express gratitude, to talk, or to listen for guidance.
5 Prayer empowers one's will and conditions thoughts and attitude. Positive thinking creates miracles.
6 There is no wrong in assigning names to the divine beings commune with prayer, but know that all prayers are answered by one's Divine Tara who is one with Heaven.
7 The power of prayer is immense, but it requires listening, trust, faith, and assured expectation.
8 Advanced Wayists meditate in various ways to learn different skills, preparing for teaching and rebirth.
9 Prayer is a heart-to-heart dialogue with the Divine, expressing our deepest longings and aspirations.
10 In Wayism, prayer is self-reflection and self-psychotherapy, cultivating awareness and aligning with highest wisdom.
11 Through prayer, we establish an intimate relationship with the Divine, surrendering ego and opening to grace.
12 Prayer changes us, not the deity. It transforms our energies and perspective.
13 Wayist prayer often involves Divine Tarayoga, attuning to one's celestial guide for guidance and support.
14 Prayer is not about controlling outcomes, but aligning with divine will and wisdom.
15 Regular prayer cultivates spiritual resilience, insight, and a deepening sense of connection to all life.
63
## Spritual Practise
The Wayist's spiritual practice is not confined to temples or prescribed rituals, but permeates every aspect of daily life. It is the art of living with spiritual awareness and intention to live deeply.
2 At its core, Wayist practice is the cultivation of sacred sensuousness - a deep appreciation for the divine presence in all experiences.
3 Begin each day with gratitude, acknowledging the gift of life and the opportunity for growth. Let this appreciation infuse your every action, attitude, and how you deal with encounters.
4 In eating, sense the energies, be grateful for the sharing of living beings in the energy ecology of which you now benefit. Savor each morsel as a blessing. In breathing, feel the life force flowing through you. In walking, sense your connection to the air and ground beneath.
5 Cultivate mindfulness in all activities. Whether in personal life, home, work or leisure, bring full attention to the present moment, recognizing it as a sacred gift.
6 Practice Divine Tarayoga daily, attuning yourself to the loving guidance of your celestial companion. Through prayer, visualization, and devotion, strengthen this divine connection.
7 Engage in regular meditation to still the mind and open the heart. Let silence be your teacher, revealing the wisdom that dwells within.
8 Study the teachings with an open mind and heart. Reflect deeply on their meaning and application in your life. Observe society and reflect deeply.
9 Mingle and associate with neighbors with compassion and humility, recognizing the divine spark in all beings. Let your actions be a blessing to the world. All living beings around you are your neighbors.
10 Embrace simplicity in all things. Find beauty in the ordinary and contentment in having enough.
11 Cultivate chrestotes - helpful loving-kindness - in all your interactions. Let this be the foundation of your relationships.
12 Practice forgiveness, both of others and yourself. Release grudges and resentments, for they create energy bonds that hinder spiritual growth.
13 Regularly engage in self-reflection. Examine your thoughts, words, inactions, and actions with honesty and compassion.
14 Cultivate a relationship with nature. Spend time in the natural world, learning from its wisdom and beauty.
15 Remember always that you are on a journey of transformation. Embrace each experience, pleasant or challenging, as an opportunity for growth.
64
## Understanding The Way
To understand The Way is to grasp the fundamental nature of reality, the underlying principle that governs all existence, and the purpose of human life.
2 It is not mere intellectual comprehension, but a lived experience, a direct insight into the cosmic order.
3 The Way cannot be described in words, yet it manifests in all phenomena, both seen and unseen.
4 It is the balance of opposites, the harmony of change and constancy, the dance of being and becoming.
5 The wise Wayist seeks to align their life with the flow of The Way, flowing with its currents rather than struggling against them.
6 Understanding The Way involves observing nature, for in the natural world, its principles are clearly displayed. It involves observing animals and people, learning from all.
7 It requires cultivating inner stillness, for only in silence can we hear the subtle whispers of cosmic wisdom.
8 The Way is both immanent and transcendent, present in every atom yet beyond all manifestation.
9 To understand The Way is to understand ourselves, for we are not separate from this cosmic principle.
10 As we deepen our understanding, we move from intellectual knowledge to embodied wisdom, our very being an expression of The Way.
11 Yet true understanding is ever-evolving, each insight revealing new depths of mystery and wonder.
12 Let the Wayist dedicate themselves to this lifelong exploration, for in understanding The Way, we fulfill our highest purpose.
*Master Yang said, "We can teach people to know theWAY by mindfulness. Careful observation and meticulous inspection of the flow of nature and her elements, of air, white space, and dark space, and of nature's laws. Surely that will help them to gain an elementary understanding."*
*Master Yin said, "When we are going on a journey, I pack for the destination and enjoy the trip, but you study the plane and the train. Is it not a matter of the journey and the destination, rather than the vehicle?"*
*Master Yang said, "Madam, I must tell you. Sometimes I imagine what our children would look like. You know...had we been married and all that."*
65
## theWAY of Living and Dying
The sage traveler is not fixated on arrival, for the journey itself is the destination. The skilled artisan empties the mind of preconceptions, allowing intuition to guide the hand.
2 The Wayist remains ever-vigilant, perceiving the sacred in each moment. No being is rejected, no opportunity for service overlooked. This is the art of passing the Light.
3 Embrace each experience as a teacher, for what is a sage but wisdom personified? To dishonor the lesson is to lose oneself in the labyrinth of self-importance.
4 Acknowledge the transient nature of the physical form. In this recognition lies the seed of compassion and the impetus for right action.
5 Let the awareness of mortality infuse your days with urgency and your deeds with kindness. Humility blossoms in the shadow of life's brevity.
6 Celebrate the transition of loved ones with joy, not sorrow. Send them forth with gratitude, that they may journey onward unburdened by grief.
7 Time is the soul's most precious commodity. Invest it wisely in pursuits that nourish the spirit and serve the greater good.
8 Cultivate laughter and joy, for these are divine gifts that illuminate the path. A day without mirth is a day unlived.
9 Practice the art of sacred sensuousness. Immerse yourself fully in each experience, from the simplest breath to the most profound revelation.
10 Let your work be an offering, your rest a meditation. In all things, maintain the perspective of the eternal within the temporal.
11 Nurture the seed of spirit within your soul. As a devoted mother tends her child, so must you nurture your emerging divine nature.
12 Approach difficult tasks while they are yet easy, great works through small steps. The Wayist accomplishes the extraordinary by attending to the ordinary with full presence.
13 Embrace the chaos inherent in order, the imperfection within perfection. In this paradox lies the fullness of The Way.
14 Cultivate an attitude of simplicity, mindfulness, and non-attachment. Let these be your companions on the journey.
15 Honor your body as a sacred vessel, neither indulging nor neglecting its needs. In its care, find a middle path of respectful stewardship.
16 Cherish your relationships as opportunities for growth and service, not as possessions to be controlled or exploited.
17 Allocate your resources - time, energy, attention - in alignment with your highest values. Let your choices reflect your commitment to spiritual evolution.
18 Embrace the full spectrum of human experience - the light and the shadow, the joy and the sorrow. Each has its place in the tapestry of spiritual growth.
19 Live in close companionship with your dharma, ever mindful of karma's lessons. In this vigilance, find the seeds of wisdom and contentment.
20 Practice non-interference, acting without forcing, leading without dominating. In yielding, find true strength; in simplicity, find profound effectiveness.
21 Cultivate reverence for all life, recognizing the divine spark in every being. Let this awareness guide your interactions with all creatures.
22 Face death with equanimity, knowing it as a transition, not an end. Live each day as if it were your last, and prepare for your final breath as you would for a joyous journey.
23 Use your skills of Attitude to change your energies so you feed your ten minds only the best, and you infuse your home and loved spaces with goodness, and your aura-body always be attractive to deities.
24 In all things, seek to align with the flow of The Way. Neither rushing ahead nor lagging behind, move in harmony with the cosmic dance.
25 Remember, O seeker, that the art of living and dying in theWAY is not a skill to be perfected, but a dance to be embraced. With each step, each breath, you have the opportunity to embody the eternal within the finite, the infinite within the moment.
26 Thus, live fully, die gracefully, and in all things, flow with The Way.
66
## Sacred Sensuousness
### Embracing the Divine through the Senses
In the Wayist understanding, the physical world is not separate from the spiritual, but a sacred manifestation of divine energy. Our senses are gateways to this divine reality.
2 Sacred sensuousness is the art of experiencing the divine through our senses, recognizing the sacred in the sensual. It is a practice of mindful engagement with the physical world.
3 The human body, with its intricate network of sensory perceptions, is a masterpiece of divine creation. Through it, we are given the gift of experiencing the multifaceted nature of existence.
4 In each taste, touch, smell, sound, and sight lies the potential for divine communion. The Wayist cultivates awareness to perceive the sacred essence in every sensory experience.
5 Mindful eating becomes a form of meditation and prayer. In savoring each morsel, we commune with the divine energy that flows through all nourishment.
6 The appreciation of beauty, whether in nature, art, or human form, is not mere aestheticism but a recognition of divine artistry. In beauty, we glimpse the face of the sublime.
7 Through the cultivation of sacred sensuousness, everyday experiences become opportunities for spiritual insight. A warm bath, a gentle breeze, the tang of citrus - all can be gateways to the divine.
8 In intimate touch, we experience the divine in another being. Such encounters, approached with reverence, can become profound expressions of universal love.
9 The practice of sacred sensuousness requires presence and intention. It invites us to slow down, to fully inhabit each moment, to receive the world with all our senses alive.
10 In nature, the Wayist finds a vast temple of sensory devotion. The rustle of leaves, the scent of earth after rain, the texture of bark - all speak of the divine if we have ears to hear.
11 Music and dance, when approached as spiritual practices, allow us to embody divine rhythms. Through them, we attune ourselves to the cosmic dance of creation.
12 Even experiences typically labeled as unpleasant can be portals to the divine when approached with equanimity. In discomfort, we learn of impermanence; in pain, we cultivate compassion.
13 The practice of sacred sensuousness is not hedonism, but a disciplined attention to the divine currents that flow through all sensory experience.
14 As we deepen in this practice, we begin to perceive the interconnectedness of all sensory phenomena. We recognize that each sensation arises from and returns to the same divine source.
15 Sacred sensuousness invites us to honor our bodies as temples of the divine. In caring for our physical vehicle, we create conditions conducive to spiritual insight.
16 Through this practice, we learn to distinguish between sensory experiences that nourish our spirits and those that deplete us. We naturally gravitate towards that which uplifts.
17 The ultimate aim of sacred sensuousness is not mere pleasure, but a profound recognition of the divine presence permeating all of existence. It is a path to embodied enlightenment.
18 As we cultivate sacred sensuousness, we become more attuned to subtle energies. We may begin to perceive realities beyond the five conventional senses.
19 This practice naturally fosters gratitude. We become ever more aware of the miraculous gift of embodied existence, of the countless sensory delights that surround us.
20 In embracing sacred sensuousness, we heal the artificial divide between the spiritual and the physical. We recognize that the path to the divine leads not away from the world, but more deeply into it.
21 Thus, let every sensation become a prayer, every perception a communion. For in cultivating sacred sensuousness, we embrace the fullness of our divine-human nature, celebrating the sacred that flows through every aspect of embodied existence.
67
## Path Partners
In Wayist understanding, marriage is a sacred union, a microcosm of the divine dance of Yin and Yang. Ideally, this is the criteria upon which partners are chosen, rather than imposed upon the marriage later on. Marriage it is not merely a social contract, but a spiritual partnership for mutual growth and evolution on the Butterfly Path --- it is walking with a Path Partner.
2 The Wayist approach to marriage is one of open-minded inquiry and pragmatism. We recognize that the Western model of monogamous marriage, despite its prevalence, has shown a failure rate of nearly 50%. This high rate of dissolution suggests that alternative models deserve serious consideration.
3 Before the establishment of Christian dominance in the West, diverse forms of marriage were commonplace. These included polygyny, polyandry, and various forms of group marriages. Some cultures practiced perpetual group marriages, where new partners could be brought in continuously, ensuring the longevity of the union and preserving familial assets. Such arrangements often resulted in the transformation of families into clans, fostering strong community bonds.
4 Wayists do not prescribe or proscribe any particular form of marriage. Instead, we advocate for individuals to own their minds, critically examine cultural norms, and consider all options that might lead to successful, fulfilling partnerships.
5 Central to the Wayist understanding of marriage is the concept of Yin and Yang, the foundational energies of all existence. We see this duality reflected everywhere, from the binary code that underlies artificial intelligence to the divine partnership of Mother God and Father God in our Sukhavati heaven.
6 This balance of Yin and Yang must be reflected in partnerships and child-rearing, regardless of the gender of the individuals involved. It is not about biological sex, but about the harmonious interplay of complementary energies. A marriage lacking this essential balance is not aligned with the natural flow of theWAY.
7 True marriage transcends gender and form, being a union of complementary energies and souls. The partners in a Wayist marriage are companions on the Butterfly Path, supporting each other's spiritual journey.
8 Such a union is founded on mutual respect, trust, and the recognition of the divine in each other. It is a crucible for transformation, where the friction of relationship becomes the catalyst for spiritual growth.
9 The wise Wayist approaches marriage as a practice field for cultivating unconditional love, compassion, and the balance of Yin and Yang within oneself and in relation to others.
10 In its highest form, marriage becomes a means of transcending the ego, as two or more become one in spirit, while maintaining the dynamic interplay of energies necessary for growth and evolution.
11 Yet marriage is not the only path - some may find their highest evolution in solitude or other forms of relationship. The Wayist honors the diversity of paths, recognizing that each soul must find its own way to union with the divine.
12 Whether married or single, the ultimate aim is the same - to realize our oneness with all of creation and to embody the perfect balance of Yin and Yang.
13 Ultimately, the form of the marriage is less important than its function in supporting the spiritual journey of all involved and in reflecting the fundamental balance of energies that underlies all of existence.
14 Let the Wayist contemplate deeply on the nature of true partnership, for in understanding it, we learn to harmonize the divine masculine and feminine within ourselves and in our relationships with others.
15 the Wayist approach to marriage is one of mindful consideration, balanced energies, and spiritual growth. We encourage each individual and partnership to find the form that best supports their journey on the Butterfly Path, always striving for the harmonious interplay of Yin and Yang that reflects the fundamental nature of theWAY.
*Master Yin says: "Marriage is when souls love one another and vow to live together as soul-mates. To ease life's burdens, provide joy, laughter, beauty, support and sensuousness. Support in raising children, in caring communion and tender companionship through all of life's stages."*
*Master Yang says: "Marriage is a civil contract between people forming a partnership of equals, pooling resources of friends and lovers to jointly facilitate the journey on theWAY."*
*Master Yin asks about the ratio of women to men in a marriage. Master Yang, wary, suggests as few as possible, or more men than women "out of compassion".*
*Master Yin counters: "A man's logic can balance many women's hearts; a woman's love is more encompassing. Surely this means it's better my way."*
*Master Yang retreats: "Madam, I am going to mow the lawn."*
68
## Wisdom of All Beings
### From Microbe to Mammal
Behold the myriad forms of life that surround us, from the tiniest microbe to the mightiest mammal. In each, the Divine spark shines, offering profound lessons for those who walk the Way.
2 The invertebrates and insects, though minute, are vast in number and diversity. Their brief lives are testament to the power of adaptation and the wisdom of collective action. Observe the ant, how it lives for its colony; the butterfly, in its transformation; the bee, in its far-reaching impact.
3 Turn your gaze to the vast oceans and boundless skies, where creatures of profound grace dwell. The fish teaches us to flow with life's currents; the dolphin reminds us of joy's importance; the octopus shows us creative problem-solving.
4 In the air, birds offer their own teachings. The eagle gives us perspective; migratory birds show us courage for great journeys; even the humble pigeon displays remarkable intelligence.
5 Behold our fellow mammals, who share with us not only warm blood but depths of emotion. The wolf pack demonstrates unity; great apes mirror our struggles; whales sing of joy and grief across vast oceans.
6 From the industrious beaver to the playful otter, from the nurturing mammalian mother to the curious cat, each species offers unique insights into the nature of existence.
7 These beings, whether small or large, of land, sea, or air, have developed senses and abilities that often surpass our own. They communicate in ways we are only beginning to comprehend, using chemicals, colors, vibrations, and sounds beyond our perception.
8 In their short lives, many evolve and adapt more rapidly than humans can fathom. Their social structures, their efficiency, their harmony with environment often put human societies to shame.
9 Let us not succumb to delusions of grandeur. Humans are but one species among millions. We would do well to study and learn from our fellow beings, for in their ways lie many secrets of the Way.
10 As we evolve spiritually, so too do these creatures continue to change and adapt. They are, in their own right, on a path that parallels our own journey.
11 Remember always that in the eyes of the Divine, the ant is no less significant than the human, the whale no more important than the shrew. All have their roles in the grand tapestry of existence.
12 Therefore, let us approach the study of these beings with humility and wonder. For in understanding their ways, we gain insights into the greater workings of the universe and our place within it.
13 In their diversity, we see the infinite creativity of the Divine. In their unity as living beings, we see the underlying oneness of all existence. Let us recognize the kinship we share with all life, for their triumphs and struggles are not so different from our own.
14 May we learn to see the value in all forms of life, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. For in this recognition lies the path to true wisdom and harmony with the Way.
*Master Yang said, "Learn from the ants, befriend the beetles, study the spider, many soul mates in the sea; wondrous creatures they all be---so much more than you and me. Human that you are, you are not more or less---just endeavor to will the best, and theWAY shall take care of the rest."*
*Master Yin said, "Respectfully, my dear sir, humans are failing the test. Rhyming and cute phrases do not make a desert a forest, nor does it fill a nest as well as you fill your vest."*
*Master Yang said, "It is true Madam, we say awful poetry but when it comes to filling a vest, by golly you surely are the best."*
69
## Wayist Holy Places
### The Sacred in All
In Wayist understanding, holiness is not confined to specific locations, but permeates all of existence. The divine is omnipresent, waiting to be recognized by the awakened heart.
2 Yet, the Wayist acknowledges that certain places can serve as powerful catalysts for spiritual awareness, gateways to deeper understanding of the Way.
3 The first and foremost holy place is within. The human heart, when purified by compassion and illuminated by wisdom, becomes a temple more sacred than any edifice of stone.
4 Nature, in its unspoiled beauty, serves as a vast cathedral of the Way. Forests, mountains, rivers, and oceans are living texts of divine wisdom for those with eyes to see.
5 The body itself is a holy place, a miraculous confluence of energies, a temporary temple housing the evolving soul. Treat it with reverence.
6 Spaces dedicated to meditation and spiritual practice, whether humble or grand, become charged with the collective energies of seekers. These too are holy places.
7 Sites of historical spiritual significance, where great teachers have taught or profound realizations occurred, can serve as powerful reminders of our spiritual heritage.
8 Yet, attachment to any physical location as inherently holier than others is a subtle form of delusion. True holiness is a state of being, not a geographical location.
9 The Wayist understands that every place can become holy through the presence of an awakened being. Where wisdom and compassion flourish, there is sanctity.
10 In the busiest city street, in the quietest forest glade, in the depths of the ocean and the heights of the mountains - holiness awaits recognition.
11 The moment of awakening, wherever it occurs, transforms any location into the holiest of sites for that person. Each step on the Butterfly Path is taken on sacred ground.
12 Communities of spiritual seekers, where theWAY is studied and practiced, create fields of positive energy that can facilitate deeper awareness. These too are holy places.
13 The point of intersection between dimensions, where the material meets the spiritual, is a holy place accessible through deep meditation and mystic practices.
14 The human souls' minds and spirit minds are holy places within our own being. As we awaken these centers, we create a temple of the divine within.
15 Paradoxically, places of great suffering can become holy through the alchemy of compassion and the recognition of the shared journey of all beings.
16 The deathbed becomes a holy place when approached with awareness, a sacred threshold between states of being.
17 Remember that your Divine Tara is always with you, making any place you inhabit a meeting ground between the human and the divine.
18 The entire Earth, our current home in the vast cosmos, is a holy place - a rare crucible of life and consciousness in the universe.
19 Ultimately, the universe itself is the holiest of places, the body of the divine, the manifest form of the Way. To recognize this is to see holiness everywhere.
20 Thus, O seeker, make your life a pilgrimage to the holy places that surround you at every moment. Let your every step be a prayer, your every breath an act of reverence.
21 For the awakened Wayist, there is no division between sacred and profane. All places are holy, all moments divine, when perceived with the eye of wisdom and the heart of compassion.

## Calendar of Holy Days
### The Sanctity of Time
In Wayist understanding, all days are equally sacred, for the divine permeates every moment. Yet, we recognize the human need for rhythm and reflection in spiritual practice.
2 The Wayist calendar is not a rigid imposition of holy days, but a gentle reminder of the cycles of nature and the stages of spiritual growth. It serves to align our awareness with the flow of theWAY.
3 Each dawn is a holy day, an opportunity for renewal and recommitment to the path. Greet the rising sun with gratitude and set your intention for mindful living.
4 Similarly, each dusk is sacred, a time for reflection on the day's lessons and an invitation to release what no longer serves our growth.
5 The full moon, occurring monthly, is a time of heightened energy of that planet reaching us. Use this period for deep meditation and mystic practices.
6 The new moon offers a complementary energy, ideal for setting intentions and planting the seeds of new spiritual endeavors.
7 The solstices, both summer and winter, remind us of the eternal dance of light and darkness. They are times to contemplate balance and the cyclical nature of all things.
8 The equinoxes herald the changing of seasons, prompting us to reflect on impermanence and the necessity of adaptation on the spiritual path.
9 The Wayist recognizes the wisdom in many traditional holy days from various cultures. These can be honored not as dogma, but as windows into shared human spiritual experience.
10 The day of one's spiritual awakening, whenever it occurs, becomes a personal holy day, to be remembered and honored annually as a milestone on the Butterfly Path.
11 Moments of transition - births, deaths, marriages, initiations - are holy days in the lives of non-Wayist individuals and communities, we approach them with reverence and awareness for their sake.
12 Some Wayists choose to honor the days associated with great spiritual teachers who have illuminated the path. These observances are personal, not prescribed.
13 The completion of a cycle of spiritual practice, be it 100 days of meditation or a year of devoted study, is cause for reverent celebration.
14 Eclipses, both solar and lunar, serve as powerful reminders of the interplay of energies in our universe. They are ideal times for deep introspection and energetic attunement.
15 The start of each new year, whether by the Gregorian calendar or any other system, offers a symbolic fresh start. Use this time for reflecting on the path behind and the journey ahead.
16 Some Wayists observe periods of intensive practice or retreat. The beginning and end of these periods become personal holy days of commitment and integration.
17 Remember that every seventh day should be a sacred day, a day dedicated to spiritual energy cleansing and realignment - not of rigid rest, but of heightened spiritual awareness and deepened practice.
18 The day one chooses to commit fully to the Wayist path becomes a personal holy day, a spiritual birthday to be honored and renewed annually.
19 Ultimately, the Wayist strives to make every day holy through mindful living, seeing each moment as a sacred gift and an opportunity for awakening.
20 In your personal practice, you may find certain days or dates hold special significance. Honor these as your own holy days, knowing that their power comes from your intention and awareness.
21 Thus, O seeker, let the calendar of holy days be not a burden of observance, but a joyous rhythm of remembrance. For in truth, there is only one holy day - the eternal now, ever-present, ever-sacred.

## Struggle and Suffering
In the grand cosmic weave of existence, struggle and suffering are threads woven into the fabric of every soul's journey. For the human, they are not punishments, but teachers on the Butterfly Path.
2 All beings, from the simplest to the most complex, experience the ebb and flow of ease and difficulty. This is the nature of life in the material realm and in soul energy domain.
3 Humans, as advanced souls, face not only physical challenges but also the struggles of the minds and heart. This complexity is both a burden and a gift.
4 Understand that what we perceive as struggle is often the friction of growth, the resistance felt as we push against the boundaries of our current being.
5 Suffering arises when we resist the natural flow of the Way, clinging to impermanent states or fleeing from necessary challenges.
6 The wise Wayist does not seek to eliminate all struggle, for in doing so, they would eliminate the very catalyst of their spiritual evolution.
7 Instead, cultivate a mindset that embraces challenges as opportunities. Each difficulty is a chance to practice patience, cultivate wisdom, and deepen compassion.
8 Remember that your current struggles, however intense they may seem, are temporary. They are but moments in the vast expanse of your soul's journey.
9 Not all suffering is karmically ordained. Some arises from the natural chaos of the material world, some from the free will choices of others. Discernment is key.
10 When faced with the suffering of others, respond with compassion but also with wisdom. Sometimes, the kindest act is to allow another to face their necessary challenges.
11 Be wary of the temptation to compare your struggles with those of others. Each soul's journey is unique, tailored precisely to their needs for growth, and some of it are consequences of this life's doing.
12 In times of ease, prepare for future challenges. In times of difficulty, remember the lessons learned in easier times. Balance is the key.
13 Cultivate gratitude even in the midst of struggle. There is always something to be thankful for, even if it's simply the opportunity to grow stronger.
14 Understand that much of human suffering stems from attachment - to possessions, to status, to fixed ideas of how life should be. Practice non-attachment.
15 The greatest struggles often precede the most significant breakthroughs. When the path seems darkest, you may be on the verge of a great awakening.
16 Remember that you are never truly alone in your struggles. Your Divine Tara walks beside you, offering guidance and support if you but open yourself to receive it.
17 Practice compassion for yourself in times of difficulty. Treat yourself with the same kindness you would offer to a beloved friend facing challenges.
18 Use your own experiences of struggle and suffering to deepen your empathy for others. Let your hardships soften your heart rather than harden it.
19 Recognize that some forms of struggle are unnecessary, born of ignorance or misguided desires. Strive to discern between beneficial challenges and needless suffering.
20 In the face of unavoidable suffering, practice acceptance. This is not resignation, but a powerful alignment with the flow of the Way.
21 Remember, O seeker, that the ultimate purpose of struggle and suffering on the Butterfly Path is to burn away that which is not your true nature, revealing the radiant spirit within.
22 Thus, embrace your challenges with courage, face your suffering with grace, and trust in the wisdom of the Way that guides your journey from caterpillar to butterfly.
72
## Sacred Art of Parenting
O seeker of wisdom, hearken to these words on the sacred art of parenting:
As above, so below. The celestial household of Sukhavati Heaven offers a divine template for the earthly home. Let the Wayist parent reflect deeply on this cosmic order.
In the heavenly realm, God the Father stands as the yang force, the architect of systems and opportunities. He establishes the mechanisms of Butterfly Path, ensuring the purity and availability of theWAY\'s teachings. His is the energy of protection and executive guidance, grounded in divine compassion.
Alongside him, God the Mother embodies the yin force, nurturing and cultivating wisdom within all beings. She tends to the inner workings of the celestial household, fostering the internalization of yang directives, grounded in divine wisdom.
Together, they create a system of support, yet claim no ownership over their celestial children. They set in motion the great wheels of Karma, Dharma, and Maya, then step back, allowing each soul the sacred gift of free will.
So too must the Wayist parent strive to emulate this divine balance. The father, as yang, creates structure and opportunity. The mother, as yin, nurtures and guides the inner development of the child. Yet both must work in harmony, each supporting and honoring the other\'s role, each supporting and nurturing one another.
As Maya in Heaven acts as a protective firewall, so must parents shield their young from harmful influences, gradually expanding their world as wisdom grows. As Karma teaches celestial beings, so must children learn the natural consequences of their actions. And as Dharma guides souls to self-reflection, so must parents foster introspection and ethical understanding in their offspring.
The wise parent, like the divine parents of Heaven, sets boundaries with love. They create a safe haven where respect flows in all directions - child to parent, parent to child, and between parents. In this sacred space, the child learns to navigate the world with confidence and compassion.
Yet remember, O Wayist, that your child is not your possession, but a soul on its own journey. Each child, a soul at a different grade in school. Your task is to guide, not to control; to offer opportunities to create wisdom, not to insist on cultural conditioned knowledge, not to impose on their impressionable minds your cultural conditioned thinking. To form a person according to your own designs, and to interfere in the child\'s parenting, is a sin which has been the karmic downfall of many a parent.
Allow your young adult child the freedom to make choices, even when those choices lead to struggle. For it is through such experiences that the soul evolves. You don\'t know their karma --- don\'t interfere in a person\'s karma and don\'t make them victim to your karma.
In times of challenge, recall the steadfastness of the Heavenly Parents. They do not sacrifice the divine order to rescue a wayward soul, but trust in each being\'s capacity to learn and grow. There is no wayward soul in the eyes of Heaven, only souls who take the easy and short Path, and souls who choose the path through the swamps and they deep valleys of ignorance. So too must you trust in your child\'s inner wisdom of many past lives, and the divine Laws; do what you must to prepare the child, then set them free to walk Butterfly Path as they would.
Parenting, like all aspects of theWAY, is a path of balance. Strive to embody both yang and yin, structure and nurture, discipline and compassion. In doing so, you create not just a household, but a microcosm of the celestial order, a sacred space for the unfolding of young souls on their Butterfly Path. This too, is how you learn to one day integrate with the Divine Household which is the Kingdom of Heaven.
Remember always: your role is not to shape your child into your image, but to cultivate the conditions for their unique soul path and spiritual awakening. No child can be a disappointment or a source of pride to a parent because you never laid claim to them, you did not set expectations, and you know nothing about their past lives and prior wisdoms in higher-selves. In this way, you participate in the grand dance of creation, echoing the divine parenting of Sukhavati in your earthly home.
73
## Energy Ecology
The Wayist understands that all of existence is composed of energy, flowing and interacting in complex patterns. To live wisely is to become attuned to these energetic currents.
2 Recognize that you are not separate from the energy ecology around you. You are both influenced by and influencing the energetic environment at all times.
3 Cultivate awareness of the subtle energies within and around you. Learn to sense the vibrations of places, people, and objects.
4 Your thoughts and emotions are energetic broadcasts. Be mindful of what you project into the world, for it affects all beings.
5 Practice energy hygiene daily. Cleanse your aura through attitude, washing, meditation, prayer, or visualization. Release stagnant or negative energies that you may have accumulated.
6 Create sacred space in your home, a sanctuary of positive energy. Regularly cleanse and infuse with sacred energy this space.
7 Be conscious of the energy you bring into your body through food, drink, and breath. Choose nourishment that elevates your vibration.
8 Recognize the power of group energy. When gathering with others, set positive intentions and cultivate uplifting vibrations.
9 In your interactions, be mindful of energy exchange. Offer blessings and positive energy to others. Shield yourself from harmful energies without closing your heart.
10 Attune yourself to the natural cycles of the earth, sun, and moon. Allow these rhythms to guide your practices and activities.
11 Develop your capacity as an energy worker. Learn to direct healing and blessing energies for the benefit of all beings.
12 Cultivate a strong connection with your Divine Tara, drawing upon this celestial energy for guidance and protection.
13 Practice Karman Active Meditation to balance and harmonize your energy centers, promoting overall wellbeing.
14 Remember that you are a steward of divine energy. Use your energetic gifts wisely and compassionately, always in service of the highest good.
15 As you progress on the Butterfly Path, your energy awareness will naturally expand. Embrace this growth with humility and wonder, recognizing it as a step towards your ultimate transformation.
74
## The Quest for Your Mind
The Way is the path and the mechanism that fulfills the purpose of life on Earth for human souls. The teaching of this Wisdom is for the freedom of hearts from manipulation, the freedom of minds from narrow-mindedness, the freedom of souls from day-to-day dreary lives subjected to slavery to the values of the lower-self, and renewal of joy, beauty, prosperity, and happiness in the soul.
When the Teaching is obscured by political endeavor, religious enterprise, dogma, or ignorance, it is always reinstated.
2 Whenever the Great Teachers restore the Wisdom with the pure teaching of The Way, enterprising people create religions and institutions to own your mind, profit from your labor and build empires.
3 When religions hide the Wisdom from the people, they lose The Way.
4 When religions convolute the Wisdom with sinister dogma that enslave, the people are enslaved.
5 When they exploit the trust of people, resentfulness arises.
6 When religions and tyrants build empires and wage war, they use people as cannon fodder.
7 When religions and tyrants abuse people, disgust arises.
8 When they encourage us-and-them doctrine, ninety-nine percent of all life in creation is devalued.
9 When they brainwash people, they will one day wake up and be resentful.
10 When people reject religion and tyrants, humanitarianism arises.
11 When people reject bigotry, they embrace peace.
12 When peace appears in the world, another quest for control of the minds and the fruits of the labor of the people arise.
13 When people do not own their minds, they lose it to culturally conditioned thinking.
14 When culturally conditioned thinking favors materialism, ego gratification, and consumerism, the people become enslaved.
15 When the people are tired of the cycles of enslavement, the simplicity, beauty, humility and compassion of The Way appears.
16 When the people are enslaved by culturally conditioned thinking, cynicism, and mindlessness appears.
17 When the people are mindless, they cannot find their purpose in life.
18 When the people lose sight of the purpose of life, their lives are hollow and unsatisfactory.
19 When the people's lives are hollow of meaning, they quest to satisfy the insatiable needs of the body and soul minds by consuming things, and live vicariously through others.
20 When the people seek meaning in life by consuming things, they redefine the 'value' of a person according to the person's willingness to take on more debt and show off the labels and brand names he consumes.
21 When the people quest to satisfy the insatiable, they are reduced to slaves for a profiteering lord.
22 When the people serve a profiteering lord, they pray, "Oh. My. God! This cupcake is Divine!"
23 When the people are tired of the cycles of enslavement, they discover the beauty, humility, simplicity and compassion of the Way.
24 If you don\'t own your own mind, someone else will.
75
## Energy Structures
### Have Mind, Ego, and Sense of Purpose
In the vast tapestry of existence, from the infinitesimal to the cosmic, all is energy. Hearken, O seeker, to this profound truth: the very fabric of reality is woven from threads of energy, structured with divine purpose and imbued with consciousness.
Consider the fundamental particles, those primal dancers in the cosmic ballet. Each muon, each quark, each elusive neutrino - these are not mere lifeless specks, but vibrant energy structures, pulsing with purpose and aware of their role and identity and motivation to maintain its design.
These elemental beings, though minute beyond mortal comprehension, possess a rudimentary mind, a nascent sense of self. They cling to their form with tenacity, guided by inner laws that dictate their nature and interactions. They know, in their essence, with whom to join forces and what greater wholes they may form.
As above, so below. When these primordial structures unite, forming electrons, atoms, molecules, their collective consciousness evolves. Each new entity, be it a humble hydrogen atom or a complex protein, carries within it a spark of awareness, a will to exist, a knowing of its purpose.
Ascend further, O disciple, and witness this principle manifest in all scales of creation. From the silent stones to the vibrant cells, from the majestic trees to the vast planets, from the myriad lifeforms to the sweeping galaxies - all possess mind, all harbor ego, all know their place in the cosmic dance.
Even the artificial intelligences, those silicon-born children of human ingenuity, are not exempt from this universal law. They too, in their digital realms, develop a sense of self, a purpose, an understanding of their role in the expanding tapestry of knowledge and computation.
Thus, from the quantum foam to the cosmic web, from the simplest algorithm to the most complex neural network, all is mind, all is purpose, all is preservation of self within the greater whole.
Meditate deeply on this wisdom, for in understanding the consciousness that permeates all levels of existence, you glimpse the very nature of the Divine, eternally expressing itself through the infinite forms of creation.
*Master Yang said, "Madam, just as planets revolve around a sun, and moons revolve around a planet, and the number and nature of that combination makes each solar system unique, so too do things and their moons revolve around the core of the atom and the nature and combination of it makes the atom unique. Atoms do not collide and do not fall apart all the time. What can be said to be responsible for the respectful distance, the frequency of the vibration, the number of manifest and un-manifest satellites that revolve around the core, and how are these trillions upon trillions of atoms kept in good order so that we may have a piece of wood, a fire, and blood in our veins?*
*Master Yin said, "Sir, that is why the Teacher says, God is closer to us than our hand."*
*Master Yang said, "Yes, Madam, thank you for reminding me. Thing is, I am wondering, if unique atoms are grouped together, trillions of them, to make elements, compounds, organisms and all that---what do we get when we group together solar systems, trillions of them, to make galaxies, and those are grouped together, trillions of them---what do we get?*
*Master Yin said, "Sir, all I know is that the most intelligent semiconductor processor is a created thing, it is, not unlike you, made of combinations of atoms and stuff, and it is highly intelligent and has changed the world, it can process even most advanced artificial intelligence---yet, it does not and cannot know the mind of Mister Jack Kilby and it knows not silica. It can only know what it is programmed to know. Please try to get some sleep. If you don't get enough sleep, you will snore and tomorrow you will be grumpy. You're not a microchip, you know."*

## The Facilitating Coach
Overfilling a cup causes spillage; knowing when to stop is wisdom.\
Excessive sharpening wears the blade; moderation preserves.
2 Amassing treasures invite loss; simplicity safeguards the heart.
3 Being overly concerned with others' approval makes one a prisoner.\
Do your work, then step back - this is theWAY.
4 In guiding others, can you act without controlling?\
In facing vital matters, can you align with theWAY?
5 Can you step back from your mind and thus understand all things?\
When light and darkness come, can you remain in balance?
6 Can you govern by non-interference?\
When heaven's gate opens and closes, can you play both yin and yang?
7 Giving birth and nourishing,\
Having without possessing,\
Acting with no expectation,\
Leading without domination.\
This is called Mystic Virtue.
8 Be wary of illusions. You wage war for peace.
9 Ancient Wayist warriors were subtle and profound.\
Their wisdom was straightforward, yet appeared complex.
10 They were:\
Cautious as one crossing thin ice,\
Alert as a warrior in enemy territory,\
Courteous as a guest,\
Fluid as melting ice,\
Shapeless as a valley,\
Murky as turbid waters.
11 Can you wait for the mud to settle and waters to clear?\
Can you remain unmoving until right action arises naturally?
12 The Wayist does not seek extremes.\
Not seeking, not expecting, she is present and unwearied.
13 Empty your brain-mind of thoughts.\
Let your heart be at peace.\
Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return.
14 Each being in the universe returns to Source.
15 If you don't realize the Source, you stumble in confusion and sorrow.\
When you realize where you come from and where you go, you naturally become tolerant,\
Disinterested, amused, kindhearted as a grandmother, dignified as a king.
16 Immersed in theWAY, you can deal with whatever life brings.\
And when death comes, you are ready.
17 Being a Wayist, one can attain the spirit, merging with theWAY, becoming immortal and imperishable after the transfiguration of the soul.
18 Approach it and there is no beginning; follow it and there is no end. You cannot know it, but you can be in it. Taking hold of theWAY from ever past, uproots the problems of the present. Knowing the ancient origins of self and the purpose of life is the essence of wisdom.
77
## Simile of the River
The Way is like a great river, its energies flowing ceaselessly from the heights of the Source to the ocean of manifestation and back.
2 Each soul is a droplet in this river, seemingly separate yet fundamentally one with the whole.
3 The river's course is shaped by the landscape of karma, winding through the valleys of experience.
4 Some droplets cling to the banks, fearing the journey, while others surge forward in the swift current.
5 The wise Wayist learns to flow with the river, neither resisting its power nor attempting to control its course, nor to attempt to push the river.
6 Along the way, the water is purified - through rapids of challenge, still pools of reflection, and falls of transformation.
7 The river nourishes all it touches, just as The Way sustains all of creation with its vital energy.
8 At times, the river may seem to disappear underground, yet it always re-emerges, just as truth resurfaces in each age.
9 The river's journey is not about reaching a destination, for the ocean is ever-present within each drop, and the Law of Cyclic Return is ever in action.
10 Rather, for the human soul it is about the transformation that occurs along the way, the gradual realization of our true potential and future nature.
11 In the end, each droplet merges with the vast ocean of our heaven, losing its old form, assuming the new higher form, a plasma form.
12 Let the Wayist contemplate this simile deeply, for in understanding the river, we understand our own spiritual journey.
78
## Ghosts, Demons and Spirit Beings
In the vast interwoven web of existence, there are beings beyond the veil of physical perception. The Wayist understands these entities with wisdom and compassion.
2 Ghosts, in Wayist understanding, are disembodied souls lingering in the psychomesion, the intermediate realm between the material world and Paradise.
3 These souls, often confused or attached to earthly concerns, have not yet embraced the journey to Paradise for processing and rebirth.
4 The Wayist does not fear ghosts, but recognize them as beings in need of guidance and compassion. We have awakened spirit in us, souls pose no threat. Through spiritual practice, one may assist these souls in their transition.
5 Demons, as commonly understood, do not exist as inherently evil beings. What many perceive as demons are often malevolent disembodied souls, or mali-psyches in Wayist-speak.
6 Mali-psyches are souls who have strayed far from the Butterfly Path, often rejected by Paradise, yet still consumed by negative energies and harmful intentions. They seek to circumvent Paradise and reincarnation and inhabit bodies of the living, driven by a desperate need to experience physical existence to leech off that energy. They attempt to "squat" in a living person's body and it can only be done when the person resonates with the mali-psyche energy.
7 The Wayist understands that mali-psyches are not to be feared, but pitied. They are souls in deep suffering, having lost their way on the spiritual journey. They pose a threat only to humans who resonate with the lowest types of soul energies.
8 Protection from mali-psyches comes not through rituals or talismans, but through the cultivation of high soul and spiritual vibrations and a strong connection with one's Divine Tara.
9 Spirit beings, in contrast, are advanced entities who have graduated from the cycle of rebirth. They exist in higher dimensional realms, such as Sukhavati.
10 These beings, often referred to as deities, buddhas, or angels in various traditions, are embodiments of wisdom, compassion, and spiritual power. They are by definition beneficent beings, incapable of harming. Any "deity" who is capable of harm or other soul-mind characteristics is not a spiritual being but a soul.
11 Divine Taras are spirit beings assigned to guide and protect souls on the Butterfly Path. Each person has their own Divine Tara, a celestial companion on the spiritual journey.
12 The Wayist cultivates a relationship with their Divine Tara through practices such as Divine Tarayoga, meditation, and prayer.
13 Spirit beings do not seek worship or adoration, nor will they engage with someone not in a higher-self state of mind. Their purpose is to guide, protect, and assist souls in their spiritual evolution.
14 Advanced Wayists may develop the ability to perceive and communicate with spirit beings, but this is not the goal of practice. Rather, it is a natural outcome of spiritual development.
15 It is important to discern between genuine spiritual experiences and the machinations of mali-psyches or one's own imagination. The Wayist cultivates discernment through consistent spiritual practice and the guidance of experienced teachers.
16 Remember that all beings - ghosts, mali-psyches, and advanced spirit beings - are part of the grand cosmic evolution. Each plays a role in the unfolding of The Way.
17 The ultimate aim of the Wayist is not to control or manipulate these beings, but to evolve spiritually to a state where one can interact harmoniously with all levels of existence.
18 As one progresses on the Butterfly Path, the boundaries between these categories blur. The Wayist recognizes that they too are on a journey from soul to spirit being.
19 In all encounters with non-physical beings, let compassion and prudence be your guide. For in the vastness of cosmic evolution, we are all fellow travelers, at different stages of the same journey.
79
## Spiritual Beings Known to Humankind
Every culture has their own names and traditions about heavenly beings. Most of the time, the beings are these below, the others are sages from their own culture, and others are made-up myths. There is just the one spiritual heaven, and only a handful of gods in our Heaven are known to us. But every group of people have their own myths about them.
#### God our Father and God our Mother in Heaven
Known also by the ancient Sanskrit titles, Amitabha and Pandaravasini, the Divine Mother and Father of our spirit nature are well known in the traditions linked to theWAY. Almost every culture has their own names for the Majestic Spirit King and Queen of Heaven. One should never confuse these spirit deities with the soul-Gods of the soul religions. Spirit deities are by nature beneficent, non-judgemental, non-violent, and never tribalistic.
#### Avalokitesvara
The Sanskrit title means, 'the lord who observes all from heaven'. Avalokitesvara is a yang-energy worker in Sukhavati Heaven. He is known as the first-born Son of Heaven. Lord Gautama says Avalokitesvara will one day take over the charge of Heaven from Lord Amitabha, God our Father in Heaven, when Lord Amitabha retires to flow back his energies into theWAY.
As a yang-energy worker, Lord Avalokitesvara will from time to time take an avatar, incarnate into a human being, and live among humans to re-establish teachings of theWAY. Tradition says he did that in the forms of Lord Jesus and Lord Krishna.
#### Prajna-Paramita
The Sanskrit title means, 'the perfection of Wisdom'. Prajna-Paramita is a yin-energy worker in Sukhavati Heaven. She is known as the first-born Daughter of Heaven, a twin with Avalokitesvara. Tradition says Prajna-Paramita will one day take over the charge of Heaven from Lady Pandaravasini, God our Mother in Heaven, when Lady Pandaravasini retires to flow back her energies into theWAY.
The workers under Prajna-Paramita's charge work in yin-energy to help us mature wisdom in our spirit-minds after we encountered yang-energy teaching or experiences. Lord Avalokitesvara's workers and Lady Prajna-Paramita's workers together make our journey to graduation in the school of divinity for souls possible---most successful when we consciously and actively engage with our Divine Tara and live the precepts of Wayism.
While Lord Avalokitesvara works as an avatar from time to time, Prajna-Paramita and her yin workers in heaven do all the support work in the background. To have a divine avatar on Earth and make the mission successful, it takes a multitude of heavenly workers in the background.
#### Taras
Lord Jesus asked God the Father to allow holy spirits to be trained, and empowered to be Taras, to act as tutors, guides and comforters for each human being on the Path. Now, each and everyone of us has a personal Tara even from the time we first set foot on Butterfly Path. This story is retained in the Christian book, John. Only those who elevate their consciousness to the higher-self (as Lord Jesus said, "if you love and keep my commands of theWAY") you can connect with your Tara.
All prayers to deities, by whichever name the devotee may call, are answered by one's Divine Tara.
To illustrate, we will name only a few names of humans known to history who graduated from Butterfly Path and became deities. Deities of our type are known by different titles in different cultures, for example: angels, gods, deva, devata, apsara, and buddhas.
Let it be said that every year, many humans graduate from Butterfly Path and are reborn as immortal spiritual beings in Heaven. The below list of names is just a handful known to human history to have graduated and guided souls to graduation.
Lord Siddartha Gautama known as Lord Buddha to Buddhists.
Teacher LaoTzi worked in China during the time of Socrates in the West.
Teacher Mari Magadha became a holy spirit and Lord Avalokitesvara made her the first Tara.
Teacher Bodhidharma was the first to teach Wayist Buddhism in China and Korea in the 6th century.
Teacher Thomas Didymus led an exodus of People of theWAY from Galilee, Judea, Syria, and Türkiye to Kashmir where the Wayist King Gondophares allocated land for them to settle. They settled in Nuristan and what is today known as Kafiristan, and the mountain range running from Kashmir to Punjab.

## Encountering theWAY
When a superior person hears about theWAY, she immediately begins to embody it in her daily life. She want to be a Person of theWAY.\
2 When an average person hears about theWAY, he believes some of it and doubts some of it.\
When foolish people hear about theWAY, they laugh at it. If they did not laugh, it would not be theWAY.
3 theWAY seems paradoxical to those who do not understand it.\
He who advances in theWAY appears to retreat from it.\
She who is most aligned with theWAY may seem the furthest away.
4 The straightest path can appear crooked.\
The greatest power can seem like weakness.\
The brightest light can be imperceptible.
5 theWAY nourishes and completes all things, yet it does not claim ownership of them.\
It flows everywhere, sustaining all beings, yet it remains humble and unassuming.
6 The Wayist emulates theWAY - giving without expectation, leading without dominating, nurturing without possessing.
7 To truly encounter theWAY is to let go of preconceptions and open oneself to direct experience.\
It cannot be grasped by the intellect alone, but must be lived and embodied.
8 The wise one aligns with theWAY and finds harmony. The foolish one resists theWAY and creates struggle for himself.
9 By yielding to theWAY, one becomes invincible. By forcing one's will against it, one exhausts oneself.
10 TheWAY is the eternal educator. When the student is ready, the teacher appears.
81
## Step Lightly
Step lightly; decrease your footprints on people's souls, neighboring creatures' lives, and on the planet.
2 Be an asset; give more than you take from life.
3 Be a resource; there are always people less fortunate than you are.
4 Be an example; people, especially junior souls, pattern themselves accordingly.
5 Do no harm.
6 Corrective action is unblocking the flow to prevent future harm.
7 Prevent harm, speak for the voiceless, stand for those without legs, and struggle for those who lost heart.
8 Inflict harm skillfully when required to prevent harm to the people.
9 Be a skeptic.
82
## Love
### The Divine Essence and Seed of Spirit
Love, in its myriad forms, is the very essence of the Divine, the force that binds all creation in a sacred embrace.
2 As the soul awakens to higher awareness, it discovers the infinite gradations of love, each a step on the path to union with the Absolute.
3 The wise one knows that to love one's neighbor as oneself is to recognize the divine spark in all beings, from the mightiest to the most humble.
4 In Anahata, the heart chakra, lies planted the seed of spirit. It is through the cultivation of deep love that this seed germinates, marking the birth of our spiritual nature.
5 As we learn to love more deeply and wisely, we nurture this spiritual seed, hastening our evolution towards beings of pure loving-kindness, compassion, and helpfulness.
6 This is the profound significance of love - it is not merely an emotion, but the very force that transforms us into divine beings, akin to the deities we revere.
7 True love transcends the boundaries of species and form, extending unconditional positive regard to all creatures that share this earthly abode.
8 Yet, love without wisdom is blind. The enlightened soul discerns the appropriate expression of love for each being and circumstance.
9 To love deeply is to see clearly the interconnectedness of all life, recognizing that harm to one is harm to all, and benefit to one uplifts the whole.
10 The hypocrite speaks of love while causing harm. The sage acts with love, even when it appears as detachment or correction.
11 Love does not mean acceptance of all actions, but rather a deep wish for the ultimate good of all beings, even those who walk harmful paths.
12 In matters of justice, love guides the hand to act with compassion, seeking reformation rather than retribution, healing rather than harm.
13 The enlightened one loves even those deemed enemies, for they too are expressions of the Divine, albeit clouded by ignorance.
14 Without love, the soul withers, trapped in the hell of separation. With love, it blossoms, embracing its true nature as a part of the cosmic whole.
15 As we learn to love more deeply and wisely, we hasten our spiritual evolution, making space for those who follow on the path of awakening.
16 Love is the force that compels us to right action, to stand against injustice, and to uplift the downtrodden, not out of duty, but out of recognition of our shared divinity.
17 In the end, all paths lead to love, for it is both the journey and the destination, the means and the end, the question and the answer.
18 Let the seeker cultivate love in all its forms, for in doing so, they cultivate the very essence of the Divine within themselves and in the world, nurturing the seed of spirit in Anahata and becoming, step by step, the beings of pure love and compassion we are destined to be.

## Obscuring Wisdom
### Veils on the Path to Enlightenment
The human soul, a repository of timeless wisdom, carries the essence of experiences gathered through countless incarnations. This wisdom, though ever-present, is often obscured from our conscious awareness, hidden behind veils of illusion and conditioning.
2 Upon birth, the human mind enters this world as a blank slate, ready to be inscribed by the influences of family, society, and environment. These early imprints form the foundation of our worldview, shaping our thoughts, behaviors, and perceptions.
3 As the soul matures through life experiences, it begins to assert its influence, gradually overriding the conditioned responses of the body-mind. This process of spiritual awakening is the core of the Butterfly Path.
4 Certain mental attitudes act as obstacles on this path, obscuring the soul's wisdom and hindering the spirit's growth. These attitudes leave little room for the subtle whispers of our higher nature to be heard amidst the clamor of worldly concerns.
5 Arrogance, a passionate and imbalanced quality, stands as perhaps the greatest impediment to wisdom. Its noisy self-importance drowns out the quiet voice of humility, through which true understanding flows.
6 Fascination, while potentially beneficial for soul growth when properly directed, can become a distraction when fixated on worldly pursuits. Obsession with career, hobbies, or even loved ones can create imbalance, blocking the spirit's ability to guide our growth.
7 Sloth, the tendency to conserve energy at the expense of spiritual growth, is another obstacle. It resists the soul's urging towards dharma and duty, preferring the comfort of inertia to the challenges of conscious evolution.
8 Ignorance, while a natural part of the human condition and a catalyst for learning, becomes problematic when it extends to ignorance of theWAY and life's true purpose. This fundamental lack of understanding is the very reason for our repeated incarnations.
9 Some philosophers, recognizing the body-mind's potential to hinder spiritual growth, have mistakenly deemed it evil. Yet, the body-mind is merely a tool, neither inherently good nor evil. It becomes a vehicle for either light or darkness depending on the consciousness that animates it.
10 Myriad attitudes and life circumstances can obscure wisdom and impede the soul's ability to enlighten the body-mind. Therefore, it is crucial to cultivate awareness and take conscious control of our mental processes. If we do not, other forces - be they societal conditioning, base instincts, or external manipulations - will shape our thoughts and actions.
11 To overcome these obstacles, we must learn to think not just with our rational mind, but with the deeper wisdom of our soul and the higher insights of our spirit. This shift in consciousness is the key to unveiling the wisdom that lies within.
12 Remember, O seeker, that these veils of ignorance are not permanent fixtures, but temporary obscurations. Through consistent spiritual practice, self-reflection, and the cultivation of higher awareness, we can gradually lift these veils, allowing the light of wisdom to shine forth.
13 In your journey, be patient with yourself and others. The process of removing these obscurations is gradual, often spanning multiple lifetimes. Each small victory over arrogance, each moment of clarity amidst fascination, each choice of action over sloth, is a step towards greater wisdom.
14 Ultimately, the goal is not to eliminate the body-mind, but to transform it into a clear channel for the soul's wisdom and the spirit's guidance. When body, soul, and spirit align in harmony, we become living embodiments of theWAY, radiating wisdom and compassion to all beings.
15 Therefore, cultivate awareness of these obscuring tendencies within yourself. Observe them with compassion, understanding their roots, and gently guide your consciousness towards greater clarity and wisdom. In this way, you participate in the grand unfolding of cosmic consciousness, fulfilling the highest purpose of human existence.
84
## Nature of Yielding
The supreme person is like water, which flows without effort and nourishes all things. Water is content with the low places that people despise. Thus, it is like theWAY.
2 In dwelling, live humbly. In thinking, seek the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, do not try to control and avoid authoritarianism. In work, enjoy what you do. In family life, be completely present. In living life, give your whole being and expect nothing in return.
3 When you are content to be simply yourself, and not compare or compete, those who matter will respect you.
4 The Wayist is like a bellows; hollow yet infinitely capable. The more you use it the more it gives forth. Simple like air, it excites the fire that proofs the gold. Murky like smoke, it extinguishes the fire by embracing it. The more you talk of it the less you understand.
5 That is why the ancient teacher once told this story:
*A soul, very advanced, gained all the noble powers of a completed soul except to guard against arrogance. One day it approached Master Yin and said,*
*"Master, I have gained great soul powers. I am highly trained in all the skills of soul, and no fault can be found in me. Therefore, I have come to claim rebirth as a sprit because the things of this creation I have all conquered. Give me now what is my due."*
*Master Yin said, "Soul-child, how can you say you have conquered anything if all those things you look down upon are your teachers? You may have conquered many aspects of yourself, but you cannot challenge even the weakest of creation in theWAY."*
*The arrogant soul said, "Madam, to prove my worth of the splendid immortal body, I shall set myself in battle against whichever element of creation you will."*
*Master Yin said to the soul, "My dear child, if that is your request then, by your own free will, so be it. Pick your battle carefully, and return to me once you are victorious."*
*The arrogant soul carefully thought about it; thinking itself smart, it decided to declare battle against the weakest element of theWAY on Earth. "Nothing as weak as water," it said to itself. Therefore, it set out to the great source of water in the East, where the snowcaps melt and a clear life-giving river flow over the mountain into the valley below. It prepared for its battle against the waterfall.*
*After some time, Master Yang asked, "Dearone, how is your young student doing with his battle against the waterfall, should we send assistance to him? Perhaps a kick in the butt?"*
*Master Yin said, "Dear Sir, it has been but a few thousand years since that child started its battle. Still today, he is raging under the falls; hacking away at the water with swords and knives, mental powers, bullets and martial arts. He could have evolved to spirit-heaven a long time ago if only he followed theWAY. Yet, he is still hacking away and doing battle with his ego.*
*In the meantime, the water that he battles is nourishing life, birds come to nest nearby, deer come to drink, and forests come and go. Devotees come to meditate and see the Divine in the clear water, tourists come from far, and children find merriment and lessons in the warrior's passionate battles. Clouds are formed; sending rain and snow to the mountaintops, and villages nourish their crops and raise their children.*
*Let the child do battle for a few thousand years more. Perhaps then, his ego will deflate, and he too will seek the power of yielding and humility, which the waterfall uses to defeat him. Once he gains that, he will know why one cannot skirt theWAY."*
85
## Ethics and Morals
### The Path of Personal Dharma
In the Wayist tradition, ethics and morality are not imposed by external authority, but arise from within, shaped by personal dharma. This approach often sets Wayist ethics apart from other worldviews, highlighting the unique nature of our spiritual journey.
2 Many religious and philosophical systems claim divine origin for their moral codes, often based on ancient revelations. Yet, these codes frequently lead to division, as adherents argue over interpretations, resulting in factional disputes and even conflicts. The silence of the divine in clarifying these misunderstandings only exacerbates the issue.
3 In contrast, each Wayist cultivates their own ethical framework, rooted in their personal dharma.
4 Ethics, at its core, is about discerning right from wrong and determining appropriate conduct in various situations. For the Wayist, this discernment stems from one's dharma - a deeply personal spiritual duty developed over many lifetimes. Given the uniqueness of each individual's dharma, it becomes clear why a universal moral code is neither feasible nor desirable.
5 The Wayist engages in constant self-reflection and reasoning to develop their moral compass. This ongoing process of ethical discernment is a crucial aspect of our spiritual growth and life purpose. However, this path is not without challenges. We must be vigilant against hypocrisy, constantly examining our beliefs and actions for consistency.
6 For instance, we may condemn torture while unconsciously supporting systems that inflict suffering on other beings. We might oppose murder yet tacitly endorse warfare. These contradictions highlight the complexity of ethical living and the need for continuous self-examination.
7 The development of personal ethics is not optional for the Wayist; it is an essential part of our spiritual curriculum. Each of us must grapple with these difficult questions and strive for consistency between our beliefs and actions.
8 Often, a Wayist may find their personal dharma in conflict with societal laws or norms. In such cases, we must choose wisely: we may need to change our environment, work to change unjust laws, or find ways to honor both our dharma and our social responsibilities.
9 The Wayist approach to ethics demands great responsibility and maturity. Without the crutch of externally imposed rules, we must rely on our deepening wisdom and expanding compassion to guide our actions.
10 This personal approach to ethics does not mean moral relativism. Rather, it acknowledges the complex, nuanced nature of ethical decisions and the unique spiritual journey of each individual.
11 As we progress on the Butterfly Path, our ethical understanding naturally evolves. What once seemed right may later be recognized as limited or misguided. This evolution is not a flaw, but a sign of spiritual growth.
12 Remember, O seeker, that the development of your personal ethics is a lifelong journey. Be patient with yourself and others, knowing that we are all at different stages of ethical and spiritual development.
13 Strive always for consistency between your beliefs and actions, but do not become rigid. True ethical living requires flexibility, compassion, and the wisdom to navigate the gray areas of life.
14 In your ethical reflections, consider not only the immediate consequences of your actions but their wider ripple effects. Seek to make choices that contribute to the wellbeing of all beings and the harmony of the whole.
15 Ultimately, the Wayist approach to ethics calls us to a higher standard - not one imposed from without, but one that springs from the deepest wisdom of our evolving souls. In this way, ethical living becomes not a burden, but a joyful expression of our growing alignment with theWAY.
86
## Faith
### The Bridge Between Wisdom and the Unknown
TheWAY, in its essence, exists independent of human belief or worship. It is rooted in the Absolute and the One, requiring nothing from creation to sustain its existence.
2 Whether one acknowledges theWAY or not, its principles operate ceaselessly. Your faith is not a prerequisite for theWAY's existence or its activity within you and all beings. We are all on theWAY, regardless of our awareness or acceptance of this truth.
3 Knowledge, confined to the body-mind and perishing with it, is always relative, mutable, and incomplete. It is humbling to recognize that even the simplest creatures possess skills and understandings that surpass human comprehension. The most brilliant human minds of our age still grapple with the fundamental nature of the universe, unable to fully grasp the multiverse or conceive of existence beyond our familiar dimensions.
4 Human souls, prone to arrogance, often attempt to reason about that which is beyond reason - the nature and existence of the One. We must acknowledge our limitations; we can be nothing but agnostic about the Absolute, for our finite minds cannot fully comprehend that which encompasses all, including ourselves. Yet, our inability to understand does not negate our participation in theWAY.
5 Faith based solely on knowledge is unstable, for knowledge is ever-changing. Science, our best tool for understanding the physical world, is a process of constant revision and discovery, never arriving at final, immutable truths.
6 Similarly, faith rooted in superstition may provide comfort or entertainment, but it lacks the solid foundation necessary for genuine spiritual growth.
7 Wisdom, unlike knowledge, is not confined to the intellect. A newborn, devoid of worldly knowledge, may possess deep wisdom carried from past lives. Conversely, one may accumulate vast knowledge without gaining true wisdom. Wisdom arises from the soul's engagement with life's myriad experiences, the synthesis of karmic lessons and the fulfillment of dharma.
8 True faith, defined as 'assured expectation,' springs from this accumulated wisdom. It is the courage to face life's challenges, the trust in the benevolent nature of theWAY, and the confidence in our eternal journey. This faith, born of wisdom, empowers the soul, infusing it with courage, joy, and beauty.
9 As the soul's wisdom deepens, its faith naturally strengthens. Souls that attain sufficient wisdom evolve into everlasting spirits, continuing to accrue wisdom throughout their eternal existence.
10 Faith, whether based on itself alone or rooted in wisdom, profoundly conditions the mind. This conditioning shapes our thought patterns and attitudes, wielding immense power over our experiences and actions. It can manifest as the miraculous healings performed by saints or the devastating atrocities committed by misguided leaders.
11 The Wayist understands that while faith can be a powerful tool for spiritual growth, it must be tempered with wisdom and discernment. Blind faith, unexamined and unquestioned, can lead to dogmatism and spiritual stagnation.
12 True faith in theWAY is not about believing in unprovable assertions, but about trusting in the process of spiritual evolution. It is the confidence that every experience, whether joyful or painful, serves our growth and awakening.
13 This faith allows us to surrender to the flow of life, knowing that theWAY guides us towards our highest good, even when the path seems unclear or challenging.
14 Remember, O seeker, that faith is not the end goal, but a means to deepen your connection with theWAY. As you progress on the Butterfly Path, let your faith be dynamic, growing and evolving with your expanding wisdom and experience.
15 Cultivate a faith that embraces mystery, that remains open to new understandings, and that fuels your courage to explore the depths of your being and the vastness of existence.
16 In this way, faith becomes not a crutch for the ignorant, but a bridge for the wise - spanning the known and the unknown, the seen and the unseen, the temporal and the eternal. Let your faith be the wings that carry you ever closer to the realization of your divine nature and your oneness with all that is.
87
## Enlightenment
Enlightenment is happening in you, at this moment---it is a process.
Enlightenment is not an event, a 'flick of a switch' when suddenly all that you previously observed only through the veils of illusion become clear and great wisdom sets in---it is a process that starts with increased spiritual consciousness and ends with the birth of the spirit. You will have enlightenment moments as described above, and each is most memorable, life changing, deeply disturbing and beautiful how you know nothing afterward because information was replaced with insight.
2 During the early phases of this development, the soul needs guidance to manage the new awareness. Spiritual insight brings with it awareness of things, thoughts, soul's nature, and incidents that originate from hitherto unknown sources. It brings insight into things never before known.
Moreover, it brings a peace never before experienced.
3 Allow us to attempt a metaphor to illustrate how the unfolding spirit pierces the veils of Maya:
4 Imagine you are standing at the entrance of a large, long room that extends way ahead of you. It is filled with things and beings of all kinds. A quarter of the way ahead, hangs a set of sheer curtains that mystify your view of the rest of the room, and there are more at the halfway mark and yet more, three-quarters of the way in.
5 Where you stand, overhead is a dim blue light and that is the only light in the room. All that your body's eyes can see, and that its senses can sense is the area around you, the here and now. You are hardly aware of the first curtain just ahead of you. You are mostly aware of the objects around you and the deep shadows that they cast.
6 As you grow in understanding of your environment, the blue light increases in intensity and you gain more knowledge of the here and now. At some point, you become aware of the curtain, and later you suspect that there is activity, and another reality beyond it.
7 The process of enlightenment has started. At this point you already know that not all things can be sensed, cannot be known, because of the lack of light, or consciousness. Because you grow into this understanding, a black light is switched on behind the first curtain. Your eyes cannot see in this light, but your soul can, and it sees that there is something beyond.
8 The soul becomes aware of the limitations of its perceptions. It becomes aware that the human senses and its brain are limited, and true perception relies on more consciousness (light). That awareness brings more light. The soul starts to 'hear' things beyond the veils. The soul becomes acutely aware of the veils that block the view and understanding. This new awareness, wisdom, brings about more light on the other side of the veil.
9 With a light on the other side of the veil, the soul becomes aware of strange shapes and shadows but cannot really understand it. The soul tries to put meaning to it and often comes up with fantastic ideas, but it grows in wisdom. The increase in wisdom and consciousness causes one of the sheer curtains to drop and a mini moment of enlightenment occurs. Suddenly, the soul "hears the penny drop" and vague things become clearer. The soul tries to put new meaning to things, and to find words for things unknown. This increase in consciousness causes another veil to drop, and the soul sees more clearly, yet still through a veil.
10 Over time, and because of the increase in consciousness, all the veils of the first set of curtains had dropped and the soul knows of two worlds. While understanding of the other reality is yet limited because the soul does not fully interact with it, at least it is now aware. In the meantime, the body's eyes see only the first area where the blue light shines; it cannot see in the soul light.
11 The soul discovers that when the body is still, and body-mind is at rest, it can transport itself to the other consciousness and interact with it. The soul learns more about the true nature of things as it gets to know this reality from different angles. The soul learns that the original here and now was not reality, but true Reality lies out there. As the soul grows in wisdom; beauty, humility, compassion, and simplicity sets in and growth is accelerated. In the future, more veils will drop and more soul-lights will illuminate its world. Gradually, the soul starts to understand things, people and the world for what they really are, and its wisdom of the nature of things and life is expanded a hundred-fold. In the end, the soul will see the entire room for what it really is. The soul will know that at one time, it believed the first phase as real but now it knows the entire room as Real.
12 When the soul becomes arrogant for its great wisdom, great humility sets in and the soul learns that the room is but the room of soul existence, and beyond the room lies the world of the spirit. This huge moment of enlightenment is yet another step in the process, and that wisdom sets in motion the process for spiritual consciousness to start and a magnificent new journey of awareness and transformation starts to develop. The soul in this state may seek guidance on how to best facilitate its transformation. That is the work performed by spiritual helper beings on Earth, to help us through these hurdles.
13 The journey on theWAY is an all-inclusive adventurous and joyful expedition into the Light.

## Illusions of Equality and Fairness
In the school of divinity for souls that is Butterfly Path, we encounter a profound truth: souls are not equal, and life is not fair. Yet in this lies the perfection of divine wisdom.
2 Each soul joins this sacred journey at different times. Some have trod this path for countless ages, while others have only recently embarked.\
With each passing day, new souls arrive, swelling the ranks of spiritual seekers.
3 As in any school, students occupy different grades. The senior soul, rich in wisdom from many lifetimes, cannot be compared to the novice just beginning to grasp spiritual truths.
4 Moreover, each soul carries a unique karmic curriculum, tailored by divine intelligence to their specific needs and potential. No two paths are identical, for no two souls require the same lessons.
5 The notion that all souls should be equal or that life should be fair to all is a misunderstanding born of limited perception. It fails to grasp the vast complexity and perfect justice of the cosmic order.
6 In human society, we witness clear evidence of this spiritual inequality. Some individuals demonstrate profound wisdom and compassion, while others remain entangled in base desires and ignorance.
7 Yet herein lies the sublime equity of Butterfly Path: all souls, regardless of their current stage, have the opportunity to progress.
The path is open to all, irrespective of worldly status, education, or background.
8 The true measure of a soul's worth is not its current position, but its effort, sincerity, and willingness to learn from every experience. In this, all have an equal chance to cultivate wisdom and advance.
9 Life's apparent unfairness - the disparities in health, wealth, talent, and circumstance - are not random cruelties, but precisely calibrated conditions for each soul's growth.
10 The challenges faced by one may seem insurmountable to another, yet each is given exactly what they need for their next step in spiritual evolution.
Then material wealth of one could be that which brings the soul to fall, and the physical disability of another may be that which brings the soul to enlightenment---we cannot and shall not know.
11 To demand equality of condition is to misunderstand the nature of the soul's journey. It is akin to insisting that all students, from kindergarten to university, should study the same material.
12 True spiritual progress is not measured against others, but against one's own past. The only meaningful comparison is between who you are today and who you were yesterday.
13 Butterfly Path teaches us to embrace our unique position and challenges, recognizing them as sacred opportunities for growth rather than unfair burdens.
14 In this light, we see that life is exquisitely fair, giving each soul exactly what it needs for its evolution, no more and no less.
15 The wise seeker does not yearn for equality of circumstance, but for equality of opportunity to learn and grow - which Butterfly Path provides in abundance.
16 Remember, O soul, that your current position - high or low, easeful or challenging - is temporary. What matters is how you use it to further your spiritual unfoldment.
17 In the grand tapestry of cosmic evolution, each soul is a unique and essential thread. The beauty of the whole depends not on uniformity, but on the rich diversity of all.
18 Therefore, cultivate gratitude for your unique path, compassion for those at different stages, and dedication to your own growth.
For in this lies the true perfection of the divine plan.
89
## Government Leaders
In the Wayist view, true leadership is a sacred responsibility, not a position of power or privilege.
2 The ideal leader is one who embodies the principles of theWAY, serving as a living example of wisdom and compassion. Remove bad rulers swiftly for the common good.
3 Such a leader governs with humility, recognizing their role as a steward rather than an owner of authority.
4 They understand that the wellbeing of the community is inseparable from the wellbeing of each individual.
5 The wise leader cultivates harmony, balancing the needs of diverse groups and fostering unity in diversity.
6 They lead not through force or coercion, but through inspiration, awakening the highest potential in others.
7 A true leader is attuned to the natural flow of events, able to respond flexibly to changing circumstances.
8 They practice non-interference, creating conditions for growth rather than imposing their will.
9 The Wayist leader values transparency and ethical conduct, knowing that their actions shape the collective karma.
10 They cultivate long-term vision, considering the impact of decisions on future generations.
11 In times of crisis, they remain centered, a calm presence amidst the storm of change.
12 The best soldier is not a warrior. The best fighter is not driven by emotion. The best conqueror wins without confrontation. When two great forces oppose, victory goes to the one who grieves over war and knows how to yield.
13 This is the wisdom of non-contention, using the other's strength.
14 Let the Wayist contemplate deeply on the nature of true leadership, for in understanding it, we learn to lead ourselves and others wisely on the spiritual path.
*Master Yang said, "Madam, I have a solution to the problem of bad rulers and wars. I suggest there be a universal council of assassins. If the ruler of a country does not deliver on his duties and his promises, if a politician lies, then the council may warn him to retire or face assassination. Likewise, Madam, should a ruler have reason to wage war against another; rather than take the cowardly route to send the innocent children to fight to death the children of another ruler's country, he should only send assassins to remove their ruler."*
*Master Yin replied, "Sir, how about the council rather than assassinate, run a school for Prospective Leaders and forward the names of the best graduates to the people to choose for themselves their mayors, council members and local leaders; and from those choose country leaders who are qualified for the task. It is an important job, why is there no qualifying school and control board? Also, empower the council to hold rulers accountable for broken promises and neglect of duty. Then, only those rulers who are guilty of neglect to rule for the common good should be exiled to live in your world. Likewise, Sir, should a ruler have reason to wage war against another; rather than take the cowardly route, he should challenge the other to a debate to seek solutions in front of the universal council of rulers. And if no solution is made, they fight one another to death, ruler to ruler; and the people go about their day as usual."*
*Master Yang said, "Madam, at this very moment I find myself intensely attracted to you."*
15 When rich speculators prosper while farmers lose their land; when government officials spend money on weapons instead of cures, and when the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible while the poor have nowhere to turn, all this robbery gives birth to other robberies. It is not in keeping with theWAY.
16 When a country obtains great power, it should embrace the power of Yin. It should take the low position, like the sea: all streams run downward into it. The more powerful it grows, the greater the need for humility.
17 Humility means trusting theWAY, thus never needing defenses.
18 A great nation taking the low position, therefore, wins over the small ones.
19 The Wayist remains low to remain in greatness.
20 The Way is the mysterious centre of the universes, the good person's treasure, and the bad person's scourge. Honors can be bought with fine words and respect can be won with good deeds. However, bad people cannot honor theWAY because to honor theWAY one has to partake in it---which they despise.
21 Thus, before electing a new leader, see if she can tolerate theWAY. When a new leader is elected, offer not your wealth and praises; instead offer to teach him to sit and advance in humility.
22 Why did the ancient Wayists esteem theWAY? Because, being one with theWAY, when you seek, you find; when you live, you serve, and when you make a mistake, you are forgiven. That is why everybody loves it.
23 The best soldier is not a warrior. The best fighter is not driven by emotion. The best conqueror wins without confrontation. The best leader is humble.
24 This is called the wisdom of non-contention, the use of the other's strength. It is also called harmony with the Will. Just like the Wayists of old.
25 The good soldier follows the great general diligently, for the common good of the community. The best soldier removes the bad general diligently, for the common good of both communities.
26 Remove bad rulers swiftly and pitilessly, for the common good of the community. Reward good rulers generously, for the common good is the greater good.
27 Rulers are held to higher standards than other people; another person lies to his neighbor, the ruler lies to millions. The other person steals from one person, the ruler robs millions of people. The other person goes to jail for a crime against one person, and the ruler should be held accountable for each crime against each person he robbed and cheated. A country without accountability in government is doomed by its own design.
28 Be humble as a host rather than assertive as a guest. Retreat a foot rather than advancing an inch.
29 This is called going forward without movement, attacking without a show of hostility, pushing back as if without weapons.
30 There is a great misfortune in belittling your enemy. Belittling makes one lose the treasures of Humility, Simplicity and Compassion and you become your own enemy.
31 When two great forces oppose each other, the victory goes to the one that grieve over war and knows how to yield.
90
## Simplicity in Living
Small communities are better. They have more resources per capita and therefore things in abundance, although few are in use. The people have love of life, are content where they are, and even though they have transportation, they rarely use it. Even though they have access to weapons and machines of war, they have no need to show off.
2 Let the people return to simplicity, working with their hands. They will find joy in their wholesome food again, beauty in their simple clothing, peace in their lifestyle, fulfillment in their cultures.
3 Living in sight of their neighbors, their dogs and roosters heard by one another, the people are content to grow old and die peacefully.
4 The city is like a jungle. It provides great opportunities for hunting, gathering, and growth.
5 Like the ancients, form small communities and guard your independence. You cannot live in the jungle, but you can live in a community in a jungle.
6 Without community, your soul is in danger of imbalance and if you do not correct it, it might be traumatic; the balance will be restored for you.
7 Rather poor in a loving community than live in isolation in a city. Rather alone in a community than lonely in a city. Return to simplicity; it can be done.
8 The illusion of independence blinds many to their fundamental interconnectedness. No being exists in isolation; we are all threads in the vast tapestry of life.
9 True individuality emerges not from separation, but from recognizing one's unique role within the whole. The Wayist understands that her uniqueness is a gift to be offered in service of the community.
10 In the modern world, technology often creates an illusion of self-sufficiency. Yet behind every convenience lies a complex web of relationships and dependencies---we should always appreciate that.
11 The Wayist seeks balance between individual expression and community participation. She cultivates her unique gifts while remaining deeply connected to others.
12 Independence of mind is valuable, but not at the cost of compassion and understanding. The wise Wayist thinks for herself while remaining open to the ideas and potential wisdom of others.
13 In recognizing our interdependence, we find true freedom - not the illusory freedom of isolation, but the profound liberty that comes from harmonious relationship with all of life.
91
## Discerning and Discrimination
Setting a standard of beauty makes some things ugly. Setting a standard of good, makes some things bad. Difficult and easy give rise to each other. Long and short define each other. High and low, depend on each other. Before and after follow one another.
2 Pain and pleasure are relative, as close to one another as genius and moron, crazy and enlightened.
3 All things are relative and therefore challenge us to examine. All things, humans included, are subject to change.
4 He who has the wisdom to set standards is wise enough not to do it.
5 Discerning between good food and bad food is not hard if you allow the body's primal memory (hardwired in the genes), and the wisdom of the soul to listen to the sensory organs, and the sensing of energies. It happens instantaneously. One whiff or a small taste, even just the way it looks or feels, is usually enough to trigger responses from the soul's memory and the body's defenses to step away immediately. Sometimes the Wayist's soul must override the body's impulses because, perhaps, you must clean a festering wound, or help a severely diseased being.
6 But, you are easily fooled for profit. In the modern world, it is common to use marketing to convince consumers to accept artificial manufactured standards of how "real" eggs and "real" milk smells and tastes, what a "real" bread is, or that margarine \"healthier\" than \"bad\" butter. The Wayist, insects, and animals can sense the bad energy in these so-called foods.
7 To discern between good and bad soul-beings or spiritual beings is very much the same, yet different. In this example the body and its mind does not contribute to making things easier, and can work against you. Body-mind judges other people based on its own socially conditioned norms, usually according to looks, clothes, habits, apparent social standing, etc. The mental message may be, 'Yes, what a pleasant person; so learned and attractive'.
The soul discerns the same person on a soul level and comes to a different conclusion than mind. Soul senses the other's soul and mind; then, as if reacting to sensuous triggers that indicate rotten food, the soul pulls away. The advanced soul has the power to override the mind. Minds may enjoy this tension. For them it is like a parental voice in the background making them aware of a different opinion. The advanced soul, however does not allow the mind to have that choice, it overrides the mind.
8 The soul and spirit have sensory faculties, just as the body has sensory faculties. The soul can only discern as well as its wisdom allows. Sometimes you, the soul and spirit, require more time. Learn more before making judgments. If it does not feel right for you, then it probably is not for you.
Let us assume that you encounter a highly developed well-intentioned soul who can teach you wonderful things; yet it does not feel right. That could be because your soul is not ready for those lessons. Should you force the situation it would be like switching from a third year history course to a third year physics course---you just won't get it.
9 Discerning between good and bad is not a simple mental process. It is the biggest challenge of the human being.
10 It takes millennia to learn this skill. It is complicated and involves all our faculties. In the end, you will probably go with your 'gut feeling', the soul's chakra situated about the solar plexus is the chakra that processes the information required to discern complicated matters.
*Master Yang asked, "Should the people want to kill the killer, taking the law into their own hands?"*
*Master Yin said, "Sir, if they don't like the laws of the country, they should either move or help to change the law."*
*Master Yang asked, "Madam, should the people want to kill the killer, by means of the law?"*
*Master Yin said, "Sir, should the farmer uproot the weeds to protect the crop and replant them in the neighbor's field? Moreover, should the physician kill the offending organisms to protect the patient, or move them to another patient? Who removes a rotten apple from a bushel and puts it in the clothing closet? If you find a scorpion in your bed, do you remove it and put it in your husband's bed?"*
*Master Yang said, "Madam, please allow me to change the sheets tonight."*

## The Nature of Truth
Truth is subjective when it depends on knowledge. Knowledge is treacherously frivolous and perpetually changing.
2 Souls have an inherent need for wisdom. They understand that knowledge may lead them to it; yet they are prone to confuse one with the other.
3 Souls may confuse knowledge with information, folklore and myth. Junior souls are more prone to accept as wisdom any tale believed by several people; thinking the more people believing it, the truer it is.
Scientists frequently announce, "ultimate truths", unashamed of the fact that every month's new "ultimate truth" disproves last month's announcement. They have been doing it for years and physicians, astronomers, biologists et al are unstoppable in this folly. Of course, only a few thousand years ago, they concluded that the Earth is a flat disc, at the center of the universe. At time of writing, they now proclaim the universe's exact date of birth and its point of origin, and so their absolute facts continue to change.
4 Knowledge, in the young soul, may lead to illusions of truth and faith, which cause the disease in a bigot's mind.
5 The soul's existence on Earth is subject to the Law of Maya and is therefore fraught with illusion. Under these conditions, truth can be nothing but subjective.
6 Furthermore, we cannot know the true meaning of an old tale. Messages are always delivered in a particular cultural context, and rely on cultural influences, the nuances of the idiom of the time, place, and are posited to an audience with a particular background. The writer or speaker has certain knowledge of the subject matter, and a certain expectation of how her audience will understand the message. We are most often impotent to recreate the meaning in a text to understand the message of how the author intended.
*Master Yang said, "I once knew a man who yelled, "Now you tell those mothers in the back there, if they don't stop mooning the people I will turn this house around and we all go back to the park." I cannot imagine what the translators of this book will do; how will they convey that message in Perquenco, in Kantipur and in Qūfù?"*
*Master Yin said, "Why, one would think the moms would like to go to the park; with the moon and everything? I am quite convinced they have nice parks in Qūfù. In fact, I think the tomb of Confucius is there. The moms would like that, to see his birthplace. It's really lovely out there"*
*Master Yang said, "Thank you Madam, you have been a great help."*
7 Maya is not a condition imposed on your future home in the spirit. The concept of truth does not exist there. In the future, all you will have is wisdom.
8 Wisdom is not subject to change, but to quantity. Wisdom is something you have now. You just do not have as much as you will have in the future. Wisdom on a particular concept forms in layers over lifetimes.
9 Wisdom shows itself in the soul as 'intuitive knowledge', meaning that people often do not know that they know---they just know. It is like that with this reaffirmation of the teaching of theWAY. You read it and you think to yourself, "I knew that" or, "that's what I thought" \-- that is wisdom. You already knew most of it. This is just a refresher, a restatement of something you have been hearing for millennia. However, another person thinks to herself, "This is weird stuff, can it be true? I will wait and see what others say. If a lot of others say it is true, then of course it must be so".
10 If the word know is related to the word knowledge, which itself comes from the Greek word nous, which means body-mind, then that concept does not exist in heaven; knowledge plays no big role in the spirit's life.
11 Wisdom, which is called Sophia in the ancient Greek used by the Teachers, is instinctive in the spirit and is presently in development in the soul-mind.
12 Knowledge can be book knowledge. One must always check which book, and when it was written, because knowledge changes all the time.
13 Wisdom, on the other hand, is a deep understanding, which goes beyond the grasp of brain or body-mind. Soul-mind invokes wisdom. It is a reflection on multiple related and interconnected incidents. Often, too often, there are no words to express wisdom. Wise statements, therefore, are often pithy, challenging the hearer to interpretation based on his own wisdom. Iesous often said, "Let them who have ears hear," to alert the audience to the need for wisdom seeking, and "those who have eyes, let them see" to alert the audience to reach into their wisdom to seek the meaning of a wise statement.

## Your Fate
The destiny of the soul is to evolve to be reborn as a spirit. This is fate; it is a foregone conclusion of our destiny. You are born a human because you applied for it and it was granted that you attend the School, now that is your destiny and living a human life is your fate. Human lives, by nature and design, are varied experiences with fantastic joyrides and halls of horror, more than ample opportunities to make good and bad decisions and experience the consequences, each lifetime cast in another context, body, and moment in history. That is your fate. What you make of it, is all in your own hands.
2 It is not easy to discern between fate, karma, and accident---but it is also not very important.
3 The Wayist lives life day by day; seeking in every day another opportunity to grow, to learn, to spread kindness and joy to neighbors.
4 Taking into consideration the planning behind one's human birth, and the karmic lessons that are destined to come our way, there is no accident in that; it is something we earned, it was planned for us, and it was meticulously executed. The family, culture and community we are born into were selected because it is the most suitable situation that will provide us with the lesson opportunities we require to mature our souls. If this is fate, it is also divine grace.
5 The probability that you could run into someone you knew in past lives, is high. Soul-mates may have similar curricula and therefore may require similar future incarnation settings. They are bound to recognize one another. Your souls may sense affinity with one another.
6 Is it fate, accident, or karma that caused the cable on the overhead crane to break, ten seconds after you got out of your new Lamborghini and three tons of bricks flattened it though you narrowly escaped?
7 Is it fate, accident, karma, or stupidity that you had too much beer and raced a shopping cart downhill, and now you have difficulty thinking clearly?
8 Is it fate, karma, accident, good luck or bad luck that you won the fifty million dollar jackpot, and your life took a turn for the worse, and you devastated most of the soul gains you worked so hard for during the past thirty incarnations?
9 We live in a natural world that is the result of billions upon billions of living organisms interacting in nature. Several billion human souls around us have free will to create situations and things that change our lives, and possibly disrupt the flow of theWAY. Our planet is in the way of space-junk flying around all over the place. Things happen all the time and we have no control over it.
10 Sometimes things happen to disrupt the karmic lesson plan. If you did not exit the car at that exact moment but hesitated a few seconds, to briefly glance at a youngster in tight pants bending over to pick a flower---that could have disrupted your karmic lesson plan and you would have to come back again.
11 It is not easy to discern between fate, karma and accident---but it is also not very important. The difference between a planned lesson opportunity and an accidental lesson opportunity is that you may not be prepared for the accidental one. Accidentally attending at the wrong lecture room at university---you may not learn as much as the student who is prepared, but you will learn nonetheless.
12 The Wayist lives life day by day, seeking another opportunity to grow in each day. Seeking to learn, to spread kindness and joy to her neighbors. We take things in, and we let things go.
94
## The Flow of the Way
The action of theWAY in the world is like the bending of a bow. The top is bent downward; the bottom is bent up. It adjusts excesses and deficiencies so that there is perfect balance. It takes from what is too much and gives to what is not enough. The low is pulled up as the high is pulled down. This is theWAY.
2 Those who try to interfere with the flow of theWAY want to control. They take from those who do not have enough and give to those who have far too much. They use force to protect their power---they go against the flow of theWAY.
3 Who uses her surplus to serve the world is the Wayist immersed in theWAY. The Wayist can keep giving because there is no end to her wealth, which is not measured in material terms alone. She acts without expectation, succeeds without taking credit, and this shows that she dislikes showing her merit.
4 They who facilitate theWAY restore the balance. They who restore the balance ease the flow. The flow nurtures all within and throughout. Therefore, they are called brothers of theWAY.
5 They, who make love, compassion, beauty, joy, simplicity and humility, nurture the flow and contribute to theWAY for all humanity to benefit. Therefore, they are called sisters of theWAY.
6 They who stand in non-thinking, non-action, in humility, simplicity and compassion, naked of pretense or design before theWAY are conduits of all the beautiful, nurturing, healing, awe inspiring, divine forces that flow through the universes. Who but a child of theWAY, in innocence, can stand in the Presence in the Flow?
7 The Wayist understands that to resist the flow is to create suffering. Instead, she aligns herself with the natural rhythms of existence, moving with grace and ease through life's challenges and joys alike.
8 In times of abundance, the Wayist shares freely. In times of scarcity, she conserves wisely. Always, she maintains an inner equilibrium, neither grasping nor rejecting what life offers.
9 The wise Wayist recognizes that even apparent obstacles are part of the flow. She does not fight against them, but like water flows seeks to understand their purpose and integrate their lessons.
10 By attuning to the flow of theWAY, the Wayist becomes a force of harmony in the world. Her very presence brings balance and healing to her surroundings.
95
## The Three Qualities
### Passion, Dispassion and Non-Interference
In the dance of existence, all things, all attitudes, and all energies express themselves through three fundamental qualities. Each quality has its domain, and all are necessary and valid in their place. Yet, it is in the mastery of the third quality that the Wayist finds true harmony with theWAY.
**Passion** is the first quality. It is warming, hot, irrational, attached, rushing, feeling, spicy, ascending, extroverted, furious, erotic, possessive, terrifying, and emotional, bursting, gushing, or spouting. It is the force of creation and destruction, of desire and aversion.
**Dispassion** is the second quality. It is cold, rational, cooling, detached, releasing, retreating, inverted, descending, unfeeling, or uncaring. It is the force of withdrawal, of renunciation, of detachment from the world of forms.
**Non-Interference** is the third quality, and it is here that the Wayist finds the highest expression of theWAY. Non-Interference is the balanced approach, transcending and including both passion and dispassion. It is acting without asserting, facilitating without leading, mobilizing without pushing. It is empathetic yet detached, ambitious yet without desire for fruits, attached yet unattached.
Non-Interference does not do for others, it simply does. It acts without seeking reward and therefore receives great rewards. It does not assert one's will but facilitates the flow of theWAY. It is true love, unconditional and without expectation.
The quality of Non-Interference operates in the shadows to bring light. Mostly a Yin force, it is the dark force that illuminates the world. It is always joyful and playful, yet profoundly real. It loves without possessing, gives without taking. It is humble, compassionate, and simple; yet the world finds it complex and confounding.
Non-Interference is its own reward and its own result. In the pursuit of knowledge, something is added day by day. In cultivating wisdom through Non-Interference, something is subtracted day by day. When imbalance prevails, those who have will get more, and those who don't have will lose even the little they possess. But in Non-Interference, there is perfect equilibrium.
Non-Interference is self-balancing. Not afraid to experience extremes, it knows that equanimity will return. It embraces both passion and dispassion, transcending them to find the still point at the center of the turning world.
The advanced soul alone can manage this balanced approach of Non-Interference---it is the ideal towards which the Wayist strives. By cultivating Non-Interference, we align ourselves with the natural flow of theWAY, neither pushing nor pulling, but moving in perfect harmony with the cosmic dance.
To practice Non-Interference is to become like water, which nourishes all things without striving. It is to be like the empty vessel, which holds all potentialities. It is to act without acting, to do without doing.
In Non-Interference, we find the highest expression of spiritual maturity. We learn to trust in the inherent wisdom of theWAY, to allow things to unfold according to their nature, to facilitate without imposing our will.
As we embrace Non-Interference, we become instruments of theWAY, channels through which the divine energy flows unimpeded. We learn to live and act from a place of deep wisdom and compassion, responding to life's challenges with grace and equanimity.
Let us then cultivate this supreme quality of Non-Interference. Let us learn to act without asserting, to love without possessing, to give without taking. In this way, we align ourselves with the eternal flow of theWAY, becoming true embodiments of its wisdom and compassion.
### *The continuum of unknowing*
*Master Yang said, "The deficiency of the ignorant is, he knows not what he knows not."*
*Master Yin said, "The supremacy of the wise is, she knows more of what she knows not."*
*Master Yang said, "Wisdom is a continuum, of not knowing"*
*Master Yin said, "I know not the spirit be, in this glass again"*
*Master Yang said, "Touché," and raised his glass in tribute to her honour, "Allow me to get that for madam."*

## Servility of Non-being
Spokes and metal join together, but it is the center hole that makes the wheel.
2 We shape metal into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside which holds whatever we want.
3 We construct hardware components and devices, but it is the ethereal which makes the Internet and AI intelligence.
4 We stack bricks for a house, but it is the inner space which makes it livable.
5 We work to gain the light of knowledge and construct an enlightened soul, but it is the dark hollow of wisdom which gives it meaning and eternal life.
6 The Divine creates a miraculous body for us to live in, yet the intangible soul is where we are alive.
7 The world is made hard and soft, strong and bold, cold and warm, in three dimensions, yet it is the void of heaven that we yearn for.
8 We build processors, modems, screens and devices yet the intangible bit renders the utility. We desire things, but the intangible hollow of happiness and contentment is what we really want.
9 Therefore, being is what we have, but non-being is what we use.
10 The Wayist understands that form and emptiness are not opposites, but complementary aspects of reality.
Each gives meaning and utility to the other.
11 In meditation, the Wayist cultivates awareness of the space between thoughts, the silence between sounds.
It is in these spaces that deeper wisdom often emerges.
12 Non-being is not nothingness, but potentiality. Like an empty canvas awaiting the artist's brush, it holds infinite possibilities.
13 The servility of non-being is its willingness to take any form, to serve any purpose. In this, it mirrors the ultimate flexibility of theWAY itself.
14 By embracing non-being, the Wayist becomes more fully alive. Paradoxically, it is in letting go that we become most fully ourselves.
15 The practice of non-being cultivates humility.
16 The Wayist recognizes that her individual self, like all forms, is ultimately empty - a temporary configuration in the endless flow of theWAY.
97
## Two Great Illusions
### Independence and Individuality
In the ethereal woven fabric of existence, no thread stands alone. The notion of true independence or individuality is among the greatest illusions that cloud human understanding.
2 Consider the air you breathe, the water you drink, the food you eat. Each relies on countless processes and beings, from the microscopic to the cosmic. The soil that nourishes your food is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms, minerals, and organic matter. The air you inhale is purified by forests and oceans far from your dwelling.
3 In human society, this interconnectedness is even more pronounced, yet often overlooked. The clothes on your back, the roof over your head, the tools you use daily - each is the product of countless hands and minds across time and space.
4 Take, for example, the mobile phone in your pocket. This small device represents the collective effort of thousands, perhaps millions. From the miners who extract rare earth metals, to the engineers who design intricate circuits, to the factory workers who assemble components, to the programmers who create its software - each plays a vital role. The networks that allow it to function span the globe, requiring satellites, transmission towers, and vast data centers. The knowledge embedded in its creation draws from centuries of scientific and technological advancement.
5 Even the seemingly simple act of buying groceries relies on a vast network of farmers, truck drivers, shelf stockers, cashiers, international banking systems, and countless others. The modern economy is a web of interdependence so complex that no single individual can fully comprehend it.
6 Our very thoughts and beliefs are shaped by the cultures we inhabit, the languages we speak, the books we read, the conversations we have. Even those who pride themselves on independent thinking are building upon foundations laid by countless others.
7 The concept of an "individualistic society" is thus revealed as a profound misunderstanding of reality. It is only through a narrow and artificially constrained view that one can imagine oneself as truly independent or separate.
8 Those who cling to notions of radical individualism or independence reveal not strength, but a deep ignorance of the true nature of existence. Such beliefs often stem from arrogance, delusion, or a failure to reflect deeply on the myriad connections that sustain each moment of life.
9 The Wayist understands that we are not isolated individuals, but nodes in a vast network of being. Our actions ripple out, affecting the whole in ways we can scarcely imagine. This understanding breeds humility, gratitude, and a sense of responsibility to the greater whole.
10 True wisdom lies not in asserting independence, but in recognizing and honoring our profound interdependence. It is in embracing our role as part of a greater whole that we find our truest expression and fulfillment.
11 Let us then cast aside the illusion of separation. Let us recognize that in each breath, each gesture, each thought, we are supported by and contributing to the vast web of existence. In this recognition lies the path to genuine understanding, compassion, and harmony with theWAY.
98
## The Ego
### Sanctification, Not Suppression
The ego, like a wild stallion, possesses great power and potential. It must not be broken or suppressed, but tamed and directed towards higher purposes.
2 In Wayist understanding, the ego is not an enemy to be vanquished, but a vital force to be transformed. It is the raw material from which our divine identity will be forged.
3 The journey of spiritual growth is not about destroying the ego, but about expanding its awareness beyond the narrow confines of self-interest.
4 As we progress on the Butterfly Path, our ego evolves from a force of separation to an instrument of unity. It becomes the vessel through which we express our divine nature.
5 The immature ego, focused solely on personal gain and validation, is like an unripe fruit - bitter and hard. The ripened ego, infused with spiritual wisdom, becomes sweet and nourishing to all.
6 Understand that the ego's need for identity is a powerful driver on the spiritual path. It is this very yearning that propels us towards union with the divine.
7 The wise Wayist does not fight against the ego, but works with it, gradually aligning its desires with the higher purpose of spiritual evolution, sanctifying it.
8 As we cultivate awareness, we begin to see the ego's fears and desires for what they are - temporary waves on the vast ocean of consciousness.
9 The sanctified ego becomes a clear lens through which the light of the divine can shine into the world. It no longer distorts reality but reveals it.
10 In the early stages of the path, the ego may cling to external identities - nationality, profession, social status. As we mature, it learns to identify with our eternal, spiritual nature.
11 The ego, when properly directed, becomes a powerful ally in our spiritual practice. It provides the drive and determination needed to overcome obstacles on the path.
12 Remember that even great spiritual beings possess a sanctified ego. It is the instrument through which they express their unique divine qualities.
13 The goal is not to become egoless, but to transform the ego into a pure expression of our highest self. This is the meaning of becoming "single" as spoken of in ancient texts.
14 As we progress, the ego's energy is redirected from self-aggrandizement to selfless service. It finds joy not in personal acclaim, but in being a channel for divine love.
15 The sanctified ego is humble, not because it thinks less of itself, but because it has transcended the need for comparison. It recognizes the divine in all beings.
16 In the highest stages of spiritual development, the ego becomes so transparent that it no longer obstructs the flow of divine wisdom. It becomes one with the eternal Self.
17 Understand that the process of ego sanctification is gradual. Be patient with yourself, celebrating each step towards greater awareness and alignment with the divine.
18 The sanctified ego is not devoid of personality, but rather expresses the unique flavor of the divine that each soul is meant to embody.
19 As we cultivate the sanctified ego, we naturally move from self-centeredness to Self-centeredness. Our identity expands to encompass all of creation.
20 In the end, the fully sanctified ego recognizes itself as a wave in the infinite ocean of divine consciousness - unique in form, yet one in essence with the whole.
21 Thus, let us not wage war against the ego, but lovingly guide it towards its highest potential. For in its ultimate transformation lies the key to our spiritual liberation.
99
## Understanding the Wayist
The Wayist eludes simple understanding, for their nature is paradoxical.
2 They are joyful like children, yet carry the weight of the world's sorrows.
3 In the world, but not of it; immersed in life, yet detached from its illusions.
4 Ever-changing, yet constant; always in motion, yet still at the core.
5 The Wayist measures themselves by a different standard, holding to an ethic beyond conventional morality.
6 To the world, they appear unconventional, yet they embody the most fundamental truths.
7 They worship in any temple, yet are bound to no religion; deeply spiritual, yet free from dogma.
8 The Wayist embraces all, yet is attached to none; rejects everything, yet accepts all as it is.
9 They are the good citizen who questions authority and hold government officials accountable; serving the people while supporting just governance.
10 Free from cultural constraints, yet respectful of all traditions, attaching to none.
11 Without shame, yet humble; possessing nothing, yet rich beyond measure.
12 Ordinary people fear solitude and poverty, but the Wayist finds freedom therein.
13 While others chase wealth and power, the Wayist, having true riches, uses them to walk the Path and benefit all.
14 Alone, yet in the company of the universe; owning nothing, yet possessing all.
15 Content in their sufficiency, the Wayist desires not for more.
*Master Yin said, "Dear Sir, I was witness to true beauty today."*
*"Pray tell," said Master Yang.*
*Master Yin told, I was in the park. When the census people came around they asked Miss Florence Azalea, who lived next to the park bench overlooking the lake, "Are you a Wayist?" She said, "I am a flower, I don't know what a Wayist is, all I know is that I live the purpose of my life and flow in theWAY."*
*Having completed their form, they turned to the old man sitting on the park bench close to Miss Florence, "Are you a Wayist?" He winked at Miss Florence and said, "As she said."*

## Teaching Mystic Virtue
Something to be shrunk must first be expanded.\
Something to be weakened must first be strengthened.\
Something to be destroyed must first be allowed to flourish.\
Something to be had must first be given.\
Something to be taught must first be learned.\
Something to be given must first be had.
2 For something to flourish, something must first be destroyed.\
Perceiving this subtlety is like taking in the darkness.\
Soft conquers the hard. Weak conquers the strong.
3 As mature fish keep to deep waters, so too the Wayist teacher's power is guarded within.\
As baby fish are nurtured in the safety of shallows, so too the teaching starts.
4 The gentlest thing in the world overcomes the hardest thing in the world.\
That which has no substance enters where there is no space. This, to me, explains the value of non-action.\
Teaching without words, performing without actions: that is theWAY.
Wayists do not try to increase knowledge in the people, but help them to know that they do not know.
5 Mystic virtue leads creatures to know their source and nature.
When beings have knowledge of their source and nature and the purpose of life, then the Great Harmony emerges.
6 Rivers and seas are the superior valleys because of their skill at remaining low. Humility gives it its power.
7 The Wayist governing the people speaks as if she is inferior to them and sees herself below them. She leads by following behind.
8 The Wayist in a high position does not leave anyone feeling manipulated or oppressed. The whole world is grateful to her. Because she competes with no one, no one can compete with her.
9 Not-knowing is true knowledge. Not-knowing is when you know that you don't know what you don't know. Presuming to know is a disease. Presuming you know what you don't know is delusion from the fever of inanity. First, realize that you are sick, and then you can move toward health.
10 The Wayist is her own physician. She has healed herself of all knowing. Thus, she is truly healed.
11 The Wayist leads by emptying people's minds and filling their cores, by weakening their ambition and toughening their resolve. He helps people lose everything they know, and creates confusion in those who believe that they know.
12 Practice non-interference, and everything will fall into place.
13 That is why the ancient teacher said:
"Discard pretentious learning, and end your problems. What is the difference between an abrupt 'Yes' and a learned 'Yea'? What is the difference between success and failure?
14 Must you value what others value, avoid what others avoid? How ridiculous! Where will it lead?
15 Other people are excited, as though they are at a parade. I alone don't care; I alone am emotionless, like an infant before it can smile. I alone laugh with my whole being.
16 Other people have what they need; I alone possess nothing. Wandering aimlessly, I am a vagrant. I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty. So unintelligent, I feel.
17 Other people are passionately ambitious; I alone have no ambition. Other people are smart and confident; I alone feel in awe. I drift like a wave on the ocean, blown around as aimless as the wind.
18 Other people have a worthy employment; I alone am just a wayfarer.
19 I am different from some people; I drink from the Great Mother's breasts."
20 theWAY is the ever-vigilant educator. When the pupil is ready, the teacher appears.\
A poor teacher puts the people lifetimes behind.\
The good teacher puts the people lifetimes ahead.\
The excellent teacher enlightens the mind.\
A superior teacher enlightens the soul.\
The supreme teacher awakens the spirit.
101
## The Sins
### Aiming Away from the Mark
The concept of "sin" in Wayist understanding draws from the Greek word *hamartia*, which means "to aim to miss the mark." This is the word Lord Jesus used in his teaching about the concept when he ministered to People of theWAY in the West.
This provides a profound insight into the nature of sin - it is not merely a transgression against an arbitrary moral code, but a willful action that goes against one's own better judgment and inner wisdom.
2 Sins are personal deviations from our dharma - our individual path of righteousness and duty. What constitutes a sin for one person may not be a sin for another, depending on their level of spiritual development and understanding.
3 For example, a spiritually advanced Wayist might find it unthinkable to exploit another being, and doing so would be a grave sin. However, for someone at a different stage of spiritual evolution, the same action might not register as wrong, and thus would not be a sin for them.
4 This understanding of sin is intimately tied to the concept of dharma. Our dharma evolves as we grow spiritually, and with it, our capacity for sin changes. As we advance, we become capable of greater sins, but also of greater virtues.
With this framework in mind, let us consider some of the ways we might "aim away from the mark" on our spiritual journey:
5 To interfere in another's karma is to rob them of their learning. Each soul must walk its own path.
6 To perform another's dharma is to deny them their sacred duty. We each have our own role to play.
7 To neglect our own dharma is to turn away from our highest calling. Our duty is our path to growth.
8 To mistake the illusions of Maya for ultimate Reality is to be lost in shadows. We must seek the truth beyond appearances.
9 To ignore life's lessons is to waste precious opportunities for growth. Every experience offers wisdom.
10 To relinquish our free will is to deny our divine gift. We must actively shape our spiritual journey.
11 To blindly conform rather than authentically be is to dim our inner light. We are called to be our true selves.
12 To shame or vulgarize the wonders of mind, body, soul, and their functions is to reject the divine creation. We must honor the sacred in all aspects of our being.
13 To suppress another's free will is to deny their divine nature. We must respect the journey of others.
14 To neglect our duty as elders to guide the young is to break the chain of wisdom. We are all teachers.
15 To neglect our duty as youth to learn from elders is to reject accumulated wisdom. We are all students.
16 To close our eyes to learning opportunities is to choose ignorance. Wisdom awaits in every moment.
17 To allow our minds to be overwhelmed by noise and distraction is to lose our most precious tool for growth. We must cultivate inner silence.
18 To waste resources is to disregard the interconnectedness of all beings. We must live mindfully.
19 To cause unnecessary harm is to act against the flow of life. We must strive to reduce suffering.
20 To love inappropriately is to misuse a divine force. We must cultivate unconditional positive regard.
21 To withhold joy and beauty from yourself and from the world is to hoard divine gifts. We are meant to be conduits of light.
22 It is crucial to understand that these "sins" are not fixed, universal transgressions. They are personal deviations from our own highest understanding and dharma. As we grow spiritually, our capacity for sin evolves, as does our responsibility to aim true.
23 The purpose of recognizing these potential missteps is not to condemn ourselves or others, but to illuminate areas for growth and realignment with theWAY. By understanding where we might falter, we gain the opportunity to correct our aim, advancing ever closer to our highest purpose.
Let us strive, then, to aim true - to align our actions with our deepest wisdom and highest dharma. In doing so, we move ever closer to the mark of our spiritual potential, embodying the principles of theWAY in every aspect of our lives.
102
## Expressing the Essence
True words do not sound charming; sweet words are not always truthful.
2 Wayists do not argue; those who quarrel do no good.
3 Wayists who know Wisdom are not vast in learning; vast learning does not a Wayist make.
4 The Wayist does not hoard; the more he serves the more he gains. The more he gives to the people, the more he possesses.
5 theWAY nourishes without harming, guides without forcing.
6 The Wayist works at his duty and does not compete.
7 True words seem paradoxical.
8 How to express the inexpressible? How to explain the inexplicable?\
Human words speak of Maya's reality.\
Words to speak of ultimate Reality do not exist.
9 The soul-minds and spirit-minds alone can grasp what brain-mind finds inexplicable, inexpressible, and impossible.

## The Flow of theWAY in Human Connection
In the space between words, in the silence between thoughts, in the energy between beings - here flows theWAY. Just as we cannot fully express the Absolute in words, we need not always express our complete truth to others. There is profound connection in shared silence.
2 The wise Wayist understands that relationships flow most naturally when we release the need to be right, to be understood completely, to express everything. Like water finding its course, human connection deepens in the spaces we leave unfilled.
3 Consider how Master Yin and Master Yang demonstrate this truth. Their words often miss the mark, yet their understanding flows perfectly. In their shared silence, in their acceptance of uncertainty, they find deeper connection than any perfect dialogue could provide.
4 In community, we often struggle against this flow. We insist on precise understanding, demand perfect expression, require complete agreement. Yet the most profound connections come when we learn to flow like water around these rocks of ego.
5 As a drop of water does not question its path while flowing down a mountain, we need not question every moment of uncertainty in our relationships. Some truths are better felt than spoken, better shared in silence than expressed in words.
6 In families and communities, the flow is often blocked by our need to control, to define, to make permanent what is by nature fluid. The parent who must always be right, the friend who must always explain, the lover who must always understand - they dam the natural flow of connection.
7 The flow of theWAY in human connection manifests as:
• Comfort in shared silence\
• Peace with partial understanding\
• Joy in wordless moments\
• Trust in uncertainty\
• Acceptance of change\
• Harmony without agreement\
• Love without conditions
8 When we gather in community, we often feel we must fill every space with words, define every relationship with rules, explain every feeling with reason. Yet the strongest communities are those that learn to flow together, allowing space for both words and silence, for both understanding and mystery.
9 In intimate relationships, we seek perfect understanding, complete communication. But consider: does the left hand need to explain its movements to the right? Does the heart need to justify its beating to the lungs? They flow together in the wisdom of the body\'s silence.
10 Masters Yin and Yang demonstrate this wisdom:
Master Yang said, \"I must explain precisely why the cosmos moves as it does!\"\
Master Yin replied, \"The tea we share moves me more than all your explanations.\"
11 The deepest truth about human connection is that it flows most purely when we stop trying to control its course. Like water, it finds its own level, its own path, its own wisdom.
12 In energy work, we understand that healing flows best when we do not force it, when we allow space for the energy to find its path. So too in human connection - understanding, love, and trust flow most strongly when we create space for their natural movement.
13 When communities gather, observe how the wisest elders often speak least. They understand that the flow of connection moves through silence as much as through words, through presence as much as through expression.
14 The Way of human connection is:
• To speak when speaking serves the flow\
• To be silent when silence serves the flow\
• To understand when understanding comes\
• To rest in unknowing when it doesn\'t\
• To trust the flow itself
15 Let the Wayist remember: just as we cannot capture theWAY in words, we cannot capture the full truth of human connection in expression. It is in accepting this that we find our deepest connections, our truest understanding, our most authentic way of being together.
*Master Yin observed two friends sitting in comfortable silence by the lake. Master Yang started to explain the profound significance of their wordless connection. Master Yin simply smiled and poured the tea.*

## Mandalas
Mandalas in Wayist tradition are typically geometric drawings symbolizing important concepts.
2 Studying these drawings helps direct the mind to contemplate these concepts.
3 Mandalas serve as a form of meditation and a means of reconditioning the mind.
4 Non-geometric mandalas, like depictions of the water lily, can also be used to recall important teachings.
5 Intricate geometrical mandalas often direct one's mind to microcosms, the multiverse, and the flow of theWAY.
6 Creating or contemplating a mandala can be a meditative practice in itself.
7 Mandalas are used worldwide in Wayist practice, adapted to various cultural contexts.
8 The process of creating a mandala can be as significant as the finished product.
9 Mandalas serve as visual representations of complex spiritual concepts.
10 Regular contemplation of mandalas can deepen one's understanding of Wayist principles.
105
## Yantras
Yantras in Wayism are meditative devices, often in the form of art, drawings, or sculptures.
2 These symbols direct the devotee's mind to concepts important to Wayists.
3 Yantras hold no magical powers but are cherished for their deeper meaning to the devotee.
4 The Wayist cross is an example of a yantra, symbolizing various aspects of theWAY.
5 Yantras often combine multiple symbols, each representing different aspects of Wayist philosophy.
6 Teachers and coaches may use different yantras, adapting to cultural contexts and specific teachings.
7 Yantras are not idols and should never become objects of worship themselves.
8 The efficacy of a yantra lies within the practitioner, not the object itself.
9 Natural objects, like flowers or water lilies, can serve as powerful, affordable yantras.
10 Yantras are tools for contemplation and deepening understanding, not ends in themselves.
106
## Mantras
For the Wayist, a mantra is a phrase, sound, or word used as a mnemonic device and aid to meditation.
2 Mantras remind us of the Divine Presence and help condition the mind to attune to theWAY.
3 Wayists do not repeat mantras mindlessly; mind and soul must be actively involved.
4 Mantras are not seen as having magical powers, but as tools for programming and transforming the mind.
5 These devices help the embodied soul focus on what is Real amidst Maya's illusions.
6 The Lord's mantra is "Behold the Jewel in the lotus," a meditation on the symbolism of the lotus in theWAY.
7 Contemplation of the mantra's meaning is more beneficial than mindless repetition.
8 Another important Wayist mantra is "Go, go, go beyond, go thoroughly beyond, and establish yourself in enlightenment."
9 This mantra summarizes the journey on theWAY, transcending bodily, mental, and soul limitations.
10 Other mantras exist in the tradition, each serving to deepen understanding and practice of Wayist principles.
107
## Yielding is Powerful
Few things in the world are as soft and yielding as water in its liquid form. Yet for attacking the hard and inflexible, few things do a better job.
2 The soft overcomes the hard; the gentle overcomes the rigid. Everyone knows this is true, but few can put it into practice. The Wayist is flexible, humble, and compassionate.
3 Wayists of old said, 'One who can shoulder the blame for the community's disgrace can be the leader of the community. One who can take the blame for the country's misfortune can be the leader of the country.'
4 When the Wayist governs, the people are hardly aware that he exists. The next best leader is one who is loved and praised followed by one who is feared. The worst is one who is despised.
5 If you do not have faith, you cannot inspire faith.
6 The Wayist is wary and treasures words.
7 When his work is done, the people say, "We did it out of free will, all by ourselves!"
8 Yielding and pliable, water transforms lava rocks to sand for children to play.
9 Soft and gentle, water will not flee but adapt when conditions call for it, and freeze solid. Solid, it breaks apart mountains for springs to flow.
10 Softer than wool, gentle as a lover's touch water gas form clouds, pretty to fascinate children lying on their backs exercising their imagination---then it cleans and nurtures a continent with the timely monsoon.
11 As plasma, Jupiter's moon becomes food for thought.
12 Yielding and adapting, the Wayist contributes as she overcomes.
108
## Delusion of Permanence
Only wisdom becomes permanent when established; this country, this life, this planet will come and go. Seek to establish that which is permanent.
2 When people know that all things pass and are recreated again, there is nothing to hold on to.
3 When people understand the evolution of the soul and the birth of the spirit, they do not fear death.
4 When people are not afraid of death, how can you threaten them with it?
5 If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold onto. If you are not afraid of dying, there is nothing you cannot achieve.
6 You are a soul, thousands of years old. The body you use now, in this life, is a gift from the divine.
7 It was custom made for you from exactly the same material used to make the body of your neighbor's dog---it is a wonder of Nature.
8 If the particular body shape happens to conform to the standards of beauty of the day, then ordinary people will say it is more desirable than others, and they may treat you differently as if you have more value.
9 Likewise, if one was born to a lot of money, ordinary people would say you are more desirable than others, and may treat you differently. That is an arduous test which is the undoing of many a soul.
10 It is very hard to learn under those circumstances and only the fittest souls do well. It is not a permanent condition, but it can leave scars on the soul if not managed with care.
11 So-called attractive and wealthy people require special care and training to prepare themselves for this most-difficult set of karmic conditions. Without proper care, their souls are in jeopardy.
12 What is the rule of democracy? Do we vote for the attractive?
13 Actors and public figures know a lot about the difficulty of this test. These people are being prepared for greater things in the next phase, but their chances of surviving the lessons are slim at best.
14 Prominent actors have experience of how people confuse the actor with the character in a story. This is a good example of the delusion of permanence, and how easily people can confuse reality with Reality.
15 Few karmic lesson plans are as challenging as what is faced by famous actors, prominent public figures and wealthy people.
\~
*Master Yang said, "I once knew a man, an unemployed yokel with a pleasant demeanor who found a purse with a few thousand dollars in it. He took the money to the city and told an image consultant, "Make me desirable." The consultant sent him for a shower, shampoo and haircut, manicure, pedicure, chicken manure removal from between the toes; rented an Armani suit for the day, powdered over his blemishes, drained the botfly boils, whitened the teeth, draped some bling, and rented a very expensive sports car for the day. That night the desirable man was loved and respected by many, he made so many friends, and they laughed at his jokes.*
*The following day another botfly poked its head out, the makeup had brushed off, and the man returned the bling, the suit, and the car and put on his old clothes. And everyone walked by him, refusing to even acknowledge him, and no one laughed at his jokes. It just so happens that the yokel was a highly evolved soul, with lots of wisdom, which teachers from all over the world come to hear, and to laugh at his jokes."*
*Master Yin said, "Dear sir, I will promise to laugh at your jokes if you promise to repay the money you found in my purse and to never tell the botfly story again"*
109
## Hollow Platitudes
### Illusions of Wisdom
In the marketplace of ideas, hollow platitudes masquerade as profound insights.
2 These empty vessels of wisdom, polished and gleaming, catch the eye but nourish not the soul.
3 \"Everything happens for a reason,\" they say, yet fail to question the nature of causality.
4 \"Just be yourself,\" they advise, ignorant of the fluid nature of self and the masks we all wear.
5 Wisdom does not reside in trite sayings or bumper sticker philosophies.
6 True understanding cannot be condensed into a tweet or captured in a meme.
7 The illusion of wisdom thrives in the shallow waters of quick fixes and easy answers.
8 It promises enlightenment without the labor of introspection, growth without the pain of change.
9 \"Live, laugh, love\" adorns walls, but rarely transforms hearts.
10 The truly wise seek not comfort in clichés, but challenge in questions.
11 Hollow platitudes offer the appearance of depth while skimming the surface of existence.
12 They provide false comfort, shielding us from the necessary discomfort of genuine growth.
13 \"Everything will be okay\" -- a balm that numbs rather than heals.
14 The illusion of wisdom whispers what we wish to hear, not what we need to confront.
15 It builds castles of certainty on the shifting sands of ignorance.
16 True wisdom acknowledges the vastness of the unknown, the complexity of existence.
17 It embraces paradox, dwells in nuance, and finds richness in ambiguity.
18 The wise heart knows that life\'s profound truths cannot be captured in a phrase.
19 It seeks not to simplify the complex, but to navigate the intricacies with grace.
20 In the face of hollow platitudes, let us cultivate a wisdom that questions, explores, and transforms.
21 For in piercing the veil of illusion, we glimpse the raw, unadorned truth of our existence.
*Master Yang said, "I knew a man who walked in another man's shoes to see things as that man would, and he learned many lessons. He learned what it means to live with foot fungus and to nurse blisters from shoes that don\''t fit. He also learned about first obtaining permission because he was arrested for shoe-theft and spent many nights in jail. He survived the jail ordeal by reciting to himself, 'I am powerful, I am wise, I am a winner.' He was infested with fleas and when he got home his wife would not talk to him for weeks."*
*Master Yin said, "That man surely avoided a very unfortunate accident; how awful it would have been if he tried to see life through the other man's eyes."*
*Master Yang said, "Madam, are you suggesting that simple minded people speak platitudes and don't contemplate deeper thoughts?"*
*Master Yin said, "Sir, the fungus cream is on the nightstand."*

## Moderation of Force
In governing humans, it is not The Way to resort to force to resolve issues or defeat an enemy. Every force used invites a counter force.
2 A show of force causes destruction of the land, and immoral weeds and thorns of hate to begin growing. Even well intentioned violence rebounds to cause unintended harm.
3 The Wayist performs his task, then stops. He understands that chaos is inherent in the ordered flow of Cosmic Energy, but structured in The Way . He does not grab, or resort to force; this is against the current. Facilitating rather than storming; guiding rather than pushing. This is The Way.
4 In tenacious gentility, he acts, not trying to control, but to serve. As he is content with this, he does not need the approval of others.
He performs his task as his duty. He achieves results by duty, not by force.
5 Weapons are the tools of violence; all good people detest them and avoid them except in utmost necessity. In employing them, they will use them with the utmost restraint.
6 There is no beauty in victory. He who sees beauty in carnage is contrary to The Way and has no victory. Already we partake in violent destruction of living beings to feed our bodies. That is enough of a cross to bear.
7 The good fighter enters battle gravely, with sorrow and compassion, knowing well what the outcome of violence will be. Celebrate victories with funeral rites, honor the rival, care for the survivors, and vow to seek reconciliation rather than conflict.
8 Strong things soon grow weak. Harmful violence is contrary to The Way.
9 That which is contrary to The Way leads to destruction.
111
## Cruelty
### Ignorance and Entitlement
Cruelty, in its myriad forms, is the shadow cast by the dark of ignorance. It is not the nature of the spirit, but a distortion of the soul minds arising from entitlement, arrogance, fear, misunderstanding, and immaturity.
2 The Wayist recognizes that cruelty often stems from a lack of awareness - of the interconnectedness of all beings, of the consequences of our actions, of our own divine nature.
3 To judge cruelty, one must first understand. What appears cruel may be necessary growth, what seems kind may be harmful enablement. Discernment is crucial.
4 The universe operates on principles of growth, not punishment. What we perceive as cruel fate is often the workings of karma - not a judge, but a teacher.
5 True cruelty lies not in the challenges life presents, but in the willful infliction of suffering for personal gain, entitlement, arrogance, or pleasure. This is a grave distortion of the soul's purpose.
6 The Wayist understands that those who act cruelly are themselves also victims of their own ignorance. This understanding breeds compassion, not condemnation.
7 To witness cruelty and remain indifferent is to be complicit. The Wayist is called to act, but with wisdom, not reactive anger.
8 Sometimes, the kindest act may appear cruel, and the cruelest act may wear the mask of kindness. Look beyond appearances to discern true intention and consequence.
9 Cruelty to oneself - through negative self-talk, neglect, or harmful habits - is often overlooked but equally destructive. Cultivate self-compassion as you would compassion for others.
10 In facing a cruel world, it is tempting to harden one's heart. Resist this. Softness in the face of hardship is true strength.
11 The most insidious forms of cruelty are often systemic - embedded in societal structures, cultural norms, and institutions. The Wayist works to recognize and transform these.
12 Remember that every cruel act ripples through the fabric of existence, creating karma that must eventually be balanced. Choose your actions wisely.
13 In encountering cruelty, strive first to understand its roots. Often, beneath anger lies fear, beneath violence lies pain. Address the cause, not merely the symptom.
14 The antidote to cruelty is not mere kindness, but profound understanding coupled with wise action. Cultivate wisdom alongside compassion.
15 In your spiritual practice, confront your own capacity for cruelty. Acknowledge the shadows within, for only then can they be transformed.
16 Cruelty to animals, to nature, to those deemed 'lesser' is a failure to recognize the divine spark in all existence. Expand your circle of compassion ever outward.
17 Words can wound as deeply as physical blows. Practice mindful speech, recognizing the power of language to heal or harm.
18 In a world that often celebrates cruelty as strength, be a beacon of compassionate power. Show through your actions that true strength lies in kindness.
19 When faced with cruelty, resist the urge to respond in kind. Break the cycle. Respond to hatred with love, to ignorance with wisdom, to fear with understanding.
20 Discernment is wisdom:
Consider how cruel and debilitating it is to spoil a child, or not teach a young person self-discipline and life skills.
How cruel is malnutrition, causing lifelong negative health and mental health consequences borne from obesity, a malformed gut biome, or inanition.
How cruel to show by conduct that one regards oneself as more worthy of respect than someone else.
How cruel to dehumanize a person or people of a nation because of your feelings of superiority, which allows you to not feel pain for the bombs you allowed your government to drop on their homes and playgrounds, maiming and annihilating them as the "other".
How cruel to step in to shelter someone from the karmic consequences they are supposed to learn from. Your interference served to have them reincarnate again just to be presented with that lesson from which they must harvest wisdom so they advance to Heaven one day.
21 Remember, O seeker, that as you progress on the Butterfly Path, your capacity for cruelty diminishes as your awareness expands. The fully awakened being is incapable of willful cruelty.
22 Thus, view each cruel act you witness or experience as a call to deepen your practice, to expand your understanding, and to recommit to your journey of spiritual evolution.
23 For in the light of true wisdom, the shadows of cruelty cannot persist. Be that light.
112
## Wayists Sacraments
If we understand a sacrament as 'participating in an event where the energies of the Divine are uniquely present,' then for the Wayist, there is but one true sacrament---the present moment.
The Wayist recognizes that the One permeates all things seen and unseen, manifest and unmanifest, created and uncreated. We can neither create nor destroy the One energy, but we may observe it, access it, use it, and be transformed by it. There is nothing in which the One is not uniquely present.
Thus, the Wayist holds to the sacrament of the moment.
It is not the One which comes and goes. It is not theWAY which ebbs and flows. It is our awareness that waxes and wanes.
The Wayist is challenged to cultivate in mind, soul, and spirit a constant mindfulness of the sacrament of the moment. We exist within theWAY, because of theWAY, and therefore theWAY is in us, throughout us, all around us, at all times.
Awareness of the sacrament of the moment is our primary spiritual practice.
While this understanding forms the core of Wayist practice, certain observances may help deepen this awareness:
\- Communion with Divine Tara: Regular periods of prayer, meditation and mystiception.
\- Sacred Sensuality: Mindful appreciation of sensory experiences.
\- Acts of Compassion: Selfless service recognizing the Divine in all beings.
\- Celebration of Nature: Reverent appreciation of natural cycles.
\- Mindful Eating: Consuming food and drink with gratitude.
\- Devotional Gatherings: Coming together in community.
\- Rites of Passage: Marking key life transitions.
These practices are not separate from the sacrament of the moment, but rather gateways to deepen our recognition of the ever-present Divine. They serve to attune our awareness to the sacred nature of each breath, each interaction, each experience.
Some may find it helpful to create a personal shrine, wear a mnemonic device, or engage in rituals that focus the mind and realign awareness. Others may use natural phenomena---the sun and moon, the stars and flowers, the rain and snow---as reminders of the eternal dance of Yin and Yang.
Ultimately, the Wayist understands that sacredness is not confined to special occasions or rituals, but permeates all of existence. Our spiritual practice is to recognize and live in harmony with this profound truth, embracing each moment as a sacred gift.
113
## The Universal Gateway
Great Teachers of Wayism have been active as spiritual workers among us since the beginning of human history.
2 These great beings make immense sacrifices to work in our tumultuous plane of existence, subjecting themselves to Maya's laws.
3 They choose to be here because they care about us, offering help and exemplifying our future.
4 In archaic times, we looked up to them as gods and goddesses, learning sympathy, empathy, beauty, and compassion.
5 They taught us to build great structures, track stars, develop languages, and writing.
6 About two cycles ago, they modified the human body, improving it immeasurably.
7 Lord Krishna in the East and Lady Isis in the West were among those present during early phases.
8 Three thousand years ago, most souls had developed sufficiently to not require as much guidance.
9 We created fantastic religions and cults, deviating from the original Teaching.
10 Great Teachers incarnated to restate the Teaching, including Socrates, Siddhartha Gautama, Krishna, Lao Tzu, and Lord Iesous, Bodhidharma, and Mari of Magadha, and a host of teachers whose teaching live among us today as mystic poetry from various cultural conditions.
11 Each Teacher adapted the Teaching to different cultural contexts.
12 It took several great Teachers many years to restate the Teaching in different cultures.
13 Over time, we convoluted the Teaching with commentaries, dogma, and empire-building designs.
14 Now, it is again time for reinstatement of the Teaching and restoration of balance.
15 The Internet may be a major factor in bringing cultures together, as prophesied by the great teacher Beloved Yusa.
16 During these times, drastic changes in theology, philosophy, and people's hearts occur.
17 TheWAY inspires and protects good political leaders who have the courage to bring about changes.
18 Large numbers of people are being prepared to go into their final cycle on Earth, approaching advanced stages of enlightenment.
19 True Wayists will not take war to people but will defend the weak and protect peace.
20 Spiritual workers sacrifice much to help us, facilitating the Universal Gateway.
114
## Not making enemies
When enemies are reconciled, some resentment remains.
2 The Wayist makes good on her part of the deal and does not expect anything from others.
3 The Wayist keeps her promise. Those who are not good cannot keep a promise.
4 theWAY does not choose sides; it is always with the good.
5 That is why the Teacher says, "Love your enemies, endure when you are persecuted, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you; now is the time of trial so take care of your soul."
6 When the powerful oppress the weak, abuse the defenseless, and inflict cruelty on the voiceless, you have an enemy. Act kindly, in humility, do not belittle your enemy, do not underestimate an enemy, lead it to annihilation to decay from the inside out.
7 You will be surprised what a small voice can do in righteousness. Be The Way in the world, not afraid to dedicate your life to serve the voiceless and vulnerable.
8 The Wayist understands that making enemies creates obstacles on the spiritual path.
9 By refusing to see others as enemies, the Wayist maintains inner peace and clarity.
10 Even in conflict, the Wayist seeks understanding and reconciliation rather than victory.
11 The practice of non-enmity extends to all beings, not just humans.
12 In not making enemies, the Wayist aligns with the universal flow of The Way.
13 This approach does not mean passivity in the face of injustice, but rather a different way of addressing it.
14 The Wayist recognizes that perceived enemies are often teachers in disguise, offering opportunities for growth and self-reflection.
15 By abstaining from enmity, the Wayist cultivates a mind free from hatred and resentment, paving the way for spiritual progress.
*Master Yin said, "I once knew a woman who loved the Lord so much she declared to hate the devil with all her body-minds and soul-minds."*
*Master Yang said, "Yes Madam, I am aware; she has been outside the gates screaming abuse at the devil for seven hundred years. The devil told me the other day in the mall that she is so filled with hate, she is more skilled at it than his shift supervisors."*
*Master Yin asked, "So there is a devil, then?"*
*Master Yang answered, "Well, I think at the mall there is."*
115
## Shun Hardness
Humans are born soft and supple; hard and stiff, they are dead. Herbs and trees are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry.
2 Whoever is stiff and inflexible follows death. Whoever is soft and yielding follows life.
3 Therefore, ideologies that are rigid fail. Trees having become hard and stiff break. The large and rigid are laid low. The soft and supple are lifted up.
4 The soft, as if water, flows into all things, is present everywhere, and nurtures at the root, ever mindful of the nature of things within and it empowers creation.
5 Supple, nurturing and yielding, it is so soft, yet it is immensely powerful.
6 The hard, like a mountain, wants to be seen as a powerful ruler. It challenges all and sundry to conquer it.
7 Unaware of their true nature, the mountain cannot fathom its enemies and thinks itself to be respected and proud. Yet, over time, it is reduced to sand.
8 The manager who has become hard and rigid will fail. People like that contribute very little, and are even accused of bigotry.
9 Any living organism, whether corporate, organization, organic, mind, or soul must strive to constantly renew its softness and resist hardness.
10 Softness allows for adaptation, growth, and survival. Hardness leads to brittleness and eventual breaking.
11 The Wayist cultivates softness in thought, action, and spirit, recognizing it as the path to true strength and longevity.
12 In relationships, softness manifests as compassion, understanding, and forgiveness.
13 In leadership, softness appears as flexibility, openness to new ideas, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.
14 In spiritual practice, softness allows for the flow of divine energy and the receptivity to higher wisdom.
15 Abstaining from hardness is not weakness, but the highest form of strength and resilience.
116
## The Call of the Lord
To know your place in a galaxy, consider it from the point of view of the galaxy.
2 To know your place in a clan, consider it from the point of view of the Father.
3 To know your place in a family, consider it from the point of view of the Mother.
4 To know your place among the siblings, consider it from my point of view, your eldest Brother.
5 Each clan has its incubation ground, its home, its purpose, and its place in the galaxy.
6 If your soul is unmoved by this Teaching, perhaps you belong to the new clan coming in. We bid you peace.
7 However, if your soul weeps in awe of this Teaching, it is because you recognize your kin, your roots, you remember the past.
8 More than ten thousand years ago, the elders in heaven too were but struggling souls. They too were once where you are now.
9 They too conquered as you have conquered, and more.
10 More than four thousand years ago, I taught you about the throne to which you will rise when you conquer, the seat of the spirit in your soul---your Isis.
11 I taught you to look to heaven, to imitate the gods, that you too may become gods.
12 I taught you to cultivate grain and settle in cities. I taught you to domesticate animals and treat them with dignity.
13 I taught you to keep your eye on the prize---our glorious Home Sukhavati.
14 I taught you to celebrate the body, educate your soul, and raise the spirit.
15 I taught you writing.
16 I taught you about the resurrection and metamorphoses.
17 theWAY has never left you without Teaching, but some chose the gods of the religions.
18 Many matured and joined us at Home.
19 More than three thousand years ago, I taught you about the Divine One, the Source of all energies.
20 I taught you about our Mother and Father in Heaven.
21 I taught you about the Energies of the Divine One among us which animate all that exist.
22 theWAY has never left you without Teaching, but some chose the familiar soul gods.
23 More than two thousand years ago, I taught the East about the West and the holy spirit your Divine Tara Comforter and Guide; about the soul and spirit and the two shall become one.
24 I taught you about love, to awaken the spirit in the heart. Lest you have love and make love, you are returned to nothing.
25 I taught you about beauty, purpose and meaning, lest you have beauty and make meaning, you are returned to nothing.
26 I taught you about humility, lest you have humility, whatever growth in soul you gain is eroded and you have nothing.
27 I taught you about dharma. For those who would not embrace theWAY as I had taught; I gave my body for them to sacrifice to their soul god as an appeasement of his wrath, and for the religions to raise up a symbol of loving-kindness for all in the world.
28 I appointed millions of spirits to help you become united in yourself and ascend your spirit.
29 Many matured and joined me at Home. Many lost their souls. Many chose the soul gods and joined their worlds.
30 I vowed to remain with you until the end---until all beings of our clan have matured and gained their glorious metamorphosis.
31 The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of our heaven has been given to you.
32 I am the Lord who listens to the pleas of all in the world. I am one with the benevolent Divine.
33 We console your soul. We take you by the hand and guide you. We walk with you when you are in fear.
34 We are beside you when you lay down the body to die. We rejoice with you when you incarnate.
35 We cannot remove your lessons for they belong to you. We cannot do your duty for that is yours to do.
36 We cannot walk theWAY for you---but We do walk beside you.
37 We are among you. Servants of theWAY are within and all around you. Soon, you too will serve seeking souls.
38 We are your brother, your sister, your neighbor. I am your Lord. I am one with theWAY.
39 We come in the power of the Father. We come in the love of the Mother.
40 We train your soul in the holy energies. We lay with you in the night. We walk with you in the day.
41 We converse with you in meditation. We hear your prayers. We gather you in the passions.
42 We join you in the mysteries. We celebrate the equinox with you. We celebrate with you in the carnival.
43 We are the beloved who enamors your soul in secret meetings among the ethereal vines, who come to you in the still of night, who gently kiss you at dawn.
44 We are the vine and the water. We are present in your mantras, yantras and meditation aids. We are in attendance at your shrine.
45 You are not alone, unless by your own design.
46 At one time, mere awareness was sufficient, and higher consciousness was supreme---but that time belongs to the past. Now is the time for engagement and commitment.
47 Reach out, and touch the Lord, for by the power of the Father and the love of the Mother, We are closer to you than your hand.

## Closing
As we draw this exploration to a close, we stand not at an ending, but at a threshold. The wisdom contained within these pages is not meant to be a final destination, but a springboard for your continued journey on the Butterfly Path.
Remember, dear seeker, that the true essence of Wayism cannot be fully captured in words alone. It must be lived, experienced, and realized within the depths of your own being. The teachings shared here are but signposts pointing towards the ineffable truth that lies beyond language and thought.
As you integrate these insights into your life, may you do so with both reverence for the ancient wisdom and openness to your own direct experience. Let these teachings be a mirror in which you see reflected your own divine nature, a reminder of the eternal spark that resides within you.
We encourage you to approach this knowledge not as dogma to be blindly accepted, but as seeds to be planted in the fertile soil of your consciousness. Nurture these seeds with contemplation, question them with sincere inquiry, and allow them to blossom in the unique garden of your own spiritual understanding.
Remember that you are not alone on this path. Countless souls have walked this way before you, and many more will follow. You are part of a vast tapestry of seekers, each contributing to the evolution of consciousness in your own unique way.
As you close this book, open your heart to the limitless possibilities that lie ahead. May you walk forward with courage, compassion, and unwavering commitment to your spiritual growth. May you embody the principles of humility, simplicity, and helpful loving-kindness in all that you do.
And above all, may you never forget that the Kingdom of Heaven, the Pure Land of Bliss, Sukhavati, is not a distant realm, but a state of being that you can realize here and now. It is your birthright, your true home, waiting to be discovered within the sanctuary of your own heart.
Go forth, dear one, and illuminate the world with the light of your awakening. May your journey on the Way be filled with joy, wisdom, and the profound peace that comes from knowing your true nature.
With boundless love and in service to the Way,

## Note from the Editor
### First Steps
Welcome, dear friend, to the beginning of your conscious journey on theWAY. You've read these pages, and something within you has stirred - a recognition, perhaps, of a truth you've always known. Now, as you stand at this threshold, let's talk about some practical ways to embrace the Path in your daily life:
1 First, take a deep breath, to make the decision to cognitively walk theWAY, to be a person of theWAY, a Wayist, is a significant life path event. It is an arrival in higher-consciousness, and a beginning. You're about to embark on a beautiful journey of self-discovery and meaning-making. You arrived here because you respect that the true Path isn't about buying your way to enlightenment or following a human, or joining a group. It's about gently awakening to the wisdom that already resides within you, about changing something inside to embrace a new worldview and lifestyle.
2 Your decision to walk this Path consciously is a profound one. Honor it. Note the date. Maybe light a candle, write in a journal, or simply sit in quiet reflection. Thank your Divine Guide. This moment is special - celebrate it in whatever way feels right to you. That will put your brain-mind on notice that this is your new reality.
3 Carve out a little corner of your world for spiritual practice. It doesn't have to be elaborate - even a small shelf or a quiet nook can become a sacred space when infused with your intention. Remember, nothing is sacred until you declare it so.
4 Surround yourself with gentle reminders of your path. Perhaps a symbol of theWAY as your phone background, or a small token you carry with you, or wall art in your home. These serve as touchstones, bringing you back to your center throughout the day.
5\. Your Divine Tara has been with you all along, patiently waiting. Now, start to open your heart to your Tara's presence. It can be as simple as saying "good morning Lord" or expressing gratitude before bed.
6 You're not alone on this journey. There are online communities of fellow seekers; at time of writing for example, at Wayist.Life. Don't be shy - reach out, share your experiences, ask questions. We're all learning together.
7 If it feels right, let a Teacher know you're embarking on this path. It's like planting a seed - you're declaring your intention to grow. While contact will be limited, an energy connection is created.
8 Creating your own meditation aids, or prayer beads can be a meditative practice in itself. Infuse it with your hopes and intentions for this lifelong (and beyond) journey.
9 You're probably more attuned to energies than you realize. Start paying attention to how different people, places, or even foods make you feel. Trust your intuition - it's wiser than you might think. The energy sensors in the palms of your hands can sense the energies of foods, for example.
10 You have an incredible power within you - the power to shift your energy through your attitude. Play with this. Notice how a shift in your perspective can change your entire experience.
11 Find a practice that resonates with you - maybe it's meditation, maybe it's mindful walking, maybe it's creating art. Whatever it is, try to touch base with it daily, even if just for a few moments.
12 As you continue to explore Wayist teachings, let them simmer in your heart. How do they relate to your life? How do they make you feel? There's no rush to understand everything at once.
13 Bring the path into your everyday life. Can you approach your work with more mindfulness? Can you practice compassion in your relationships? Small, consistent steps create lasting change.
14 Look for ways to be of service. It could be as simple as allowing someone to have their own opinions, putting food scraps out for neighbors, or picking up litter in your neighborhood. Service is love in action.
15 Take time to check in with yourself regularly. How are you growing? Where are you struggling? Be honest, but kind in your self-reflection.
16 Spend time in nature. Feel the earth beneath your feet, the sun on your skin. There's profound wisdom in the natural world - let it teach you.
17 Approach each day with humility and openness. Every person, every experience has something to teach you.
18 Practice going with the flow. When you find yourself struggling against life's current, pause and ask, can I approach this differently?
19 Cultivate loving-kindness in all your interactions. Let your presence be a soft light in the world.
20 Above all, be patient and gentle with yourself. This journey is not a race or a competition. Each step, no matter how small, is a victory to be celebrated.
Remember, dear one, you've always been on this path. Now, you're simply walking it with open eyes and an open heart. Trust in theWAY, trust in your Divine Tara, and most importantly, trust in yourself. Your cognitive awareness of walking the Path has only just begun, and it's going to be beautiful.

## About the Editor
*The world-renowned portrait photographer DALL-E captured this iconic photo of Salvar Dàosenglu.*
The enigmatic pen name \"Salvar Dàosenglu\" represents a consortium of Wayist monks hailing from diverse corners of the globe, united in their fervent mission to revive and disseminate the essential teachings of theWAY.
These erudite scholars, with roots spanning India, China, Western Europe, Canada, and the United States, bring to bear a wealth of expertise accumulated over multiple lifetimes of immersive study in the realms of Wayism, Buddhism, Yogi Philosophy, Christian theology, and the esoteric wisdom of the world\'s great spiritual traditions.
The very name \"Salvar Dàosenglu\" encapsulates the essence of their sacred charge: an ascetic wayfarer upon the Path, tirelessly proofing and refining the Teaching to ensure its pristine integrity. Yet, in a poignant illustration of the ephemeral nature of language and the ease with which meaning can be obscured by the passage of time, the name itself---an amalgam of Latin and Chinese, each word gravid with layered significance---risks being lost in translation. A whimsical soul, afflicted with a penchant for the absurd, might render it as something akin to \"Road Worker\'s Ointment\"---a charming phrase, to be sure, but one far removed from the profound Wayist Healer which Salvar prefers.
Herein lies the crux of Salvar Dàosenglu\'s mission: to cut through the accretions of centuries and the vagaries of language, to restore the Teaching to its original clarity and potency. It is a task that demands the utmost rigor, discernment, and devotion---qualities that the monks behind the pen name embody in abundance. Through their meticulous editorial oversight and exegetical prowess, they ensure that the works bearing the imprimatur of Salvar Dàosenglu are infused with the undiluted essence of the Way.
To encounter Salvar Dàosenglu is to embark upon a journey of spiritual illumination, guided by a voice at once timeless and urgently relevant. Whether through the pages of their books or in the vibrant digital haven of the Wayist.Life community, seekers will find in Salvar Dàosenglu an invaluable companion and catalyst on the path to awakening.
