## Mandalas and Mantras in theWAY

## Mandalas and Mantras: Tools for Spiritual Connection
In the rich tapestry of spiritual traditions worldwide, mandalas and mantras often hold a place of great significance. Many believe these sacred symbols and phrases possess inherent powers or magical energies, capable of bestowing good fortune, warding off evil, or granting specific abilities to those who use them. However, in Wayism, we approach mandalas and mantras from a different perspective, recognizing them as valuable tools for crafting spiritual connections and conveying truth and wisdom, rather than as talismans imbued with supernatural powers.
### The Role of Mandalas and Mantras in Wayism
In Wayism, mandalas and mantras serve as focal points for spiritual practice and personal growth. They are not regarded as magical objects that can manipulate reality or grant wishes but rather as tools that, when used skillfully and with pure intention, can help us forge a deeper connection with Heaven and the divine wisdom of theWAY.
Mandalas, with their intricate geometric designs and rich symbolism, act as visual representations of the fundamental truths and teachings of Wayism. Each element within a mandala, such as the WayShower Mandala, holds profound meaning and serves as a reminder of the key principles that guide us along the path of spiritual growth. By meditating on these sacred images and contemplating their significance, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves, the universe, and our place within it.
Similarly, mantras in Wayism are not believed to hold inherent magical properties. Instead, they serve as powerful phrases or affirmations that, when repeated with focus and sincerity, can help us attune our minds and hearts to the wisdom of theWAY. By reciting mantras, we create a mental and emotional state conducive to spiritual growth, allowing us to cultivate qualities such as compassion, mindfulness, and inner peace.
### The Importance of Understanding and Intention
For those who are not initiated into the deeper meanings of mandalas and mantras, these sacred symbols and phrases may appear to be little more than decorative images or meaningless utterances. Without the context and understanding of the spiritual teachings they represent, the true power and significance of mandalas and mantras can easily be overlooked.
This is why, in Wayism, we place great emphasis on educating and guiding individuals in the proper understanding and use of these spiritual tools. By delving into the rich symbolism of mandalas and the profound meanings behind mantras, we can unlock their true potential as aids for spiritual growth and connection.
It is also important to recognize that the mere possession or recitation of mandalas and mantras does not automatically confer spiritual advancement or enlightenment. There are those who may carry these sacred symbols or recite phrases in an attempt to appear spiritual or religious, seeking to impress others or gain a sense of belonging. While they may indeed achieve their desired outcome on a superficial level, true spiritual growth requires more than mere appearances.
### Walking the Path of Spiritual Growth
In Wayism, we understand that mandalas and mantras are ultimately like road signs or maps, pointing us towards a higher Reality and guiding us along the path of spiritual growth. They are not the destination itself, but rather tools that can help us navigate the complexities of the human experience and connect with the divine wisdom of theWAY.
To truly benefit from these sacred symbols and phrases, we must approach them with sincerity, humility, and a genuine desire for spiritual growth. It is not enough to simply surround ourselves with mandalas or recite mantras without engaging in the deeper work of self-reflection, meditation, and the cultivation of wisdom and compassion.
As Wayists, we recognize that the path of spiritual growth is a journey that requires consistent effort, dedication, and a willingness to learn and grow from our experiences. Mandalas and mantras can be powerful allies on this journey, but they are not a substitute for the inner work and transformation that true spiritual growth demands.
### Cultivating a Genuine Spiritual Practice
To truly harness the potential of mandalas and mantras as tools for spiritual connection and growth, it is essential to cultivate a genuine spiritual practice rooted in the teachings of Wayism. This involves setting aside regular time for meditation, self-reflection, and the study of spiritual texts and teachings.
By engaging in these practices consistently and with an open heart, we can begin to internalize the wisdom and insights represented by mandalas and mantras, allowing them to guide us on our path of spiritual growth. As we deepen our understanding and connection with these sacred tools, we may find that they become increasingly powerful aids in our journey towards union with the divine.
It is also important to remember that spiritual growth is not a solitary endeavor. In Wayism, we recognize the value of community and the support and guidance that can come from sharing our journey with others who are also walking the path of theWAY. By connecting with fellow Wayists, we can learn from one another\'s experiences, offer encouragement and support, and collectively deepen our understanding and embodiment of the teachings represented by mandalas and mantras.
### Conclusion
In Wayism, mandalas and mantras are cherished as powerful tools for crafting spiritual connections and conveying the timeless wisdom of theWAY. While we do not ascribe magical properties or supernatural powers to these sacred symbols and phrases, we recognize their immense value as aids for personal growth and spiritual transformation.
By approaching mandalas and mantras with sincerity, understanding, and a genuine desire for spiritual growth, we can unlock their true potential as catalysts for self-discovery, inner peace, and a deeper connection with the divine. As we walk the path of Wayism, let us embrace these sacred tools not as mere talismans, but as precious guides and companions on our journey towards unity with theWAY and the realization of our highest spiritual potential.
## Introduction to WayShower Mandala
The Margadarzaka Mandala, also known as the WayShower Mandala, holds significance our tradition. This mandala is often associated with Lord Avalokitesvara, in Buddhism called the Buddha of Compassion, because he is the most prominent deity who "shows theWay" and re-established the teaching when it becomes obscured over time.
### Purpose and Elements:
\- The Margadarzaka Mandala serves as a visual representation that guides practitioners through the ontology of Wayism, which is the teaching of the fundamental metaphysics that underlie Reality, and for the human, the purpose and meaning of life.
\- It contains elements that help seekers understand the universe, its laws, and the path to enlightenment.
\- Devotional artwork often features this mandala alongside Avalokitesvara.

Devotional artwork often features this mandala alongside Lord Avalokitesvara, in Buddhism known as the Buddha of Compassion.
Two chapters of this book present the older esoteric text, which is the received text from sages of old. In days gone by, the text was memorized to be recited from the heart around the kitchen table. Chapter three is a modern-language explanation of the received text.
The thangka below is called the Guardian of Souls thangka of Lord Avalokitesvara. It shows a version of the Margadarzaka Mandala, or in English, the WayShower Mandala, behind the Lord.
Lord Avalokitesvara and his twin sister were the first two spiritual beings created when our heaven began long ago. The Lord is a yang-energy worker, and Lady Prajnaparamita is a yin-energy worker, and for those reasons alone, the energy which these deities specialize in, makes us humans think of one as male and the other as female---that is normal for humans. Spiritual beings do not have biological or gendered bodies.
As a yang-energy worker, the Lord is the primary Way-shower, also known as the Lord Who Shows the Way, the Buddha of Compassion, whose mantra is Om Mani Padme Hum---the most widely used mantra in the world.
Lord Avalokiteshvara would occasionally descend into an avatar, a human body, to repair the teachings of theWAY when they have decayed. In the thangka below, the Lord holds in his protective hands the spiritual potential of all human souls, known as the Chintamani or the wish-fulfilling jewel that is placed in our heart chakra---the jewel of all potential.
The words in red at the top read "Avalokiteshvara". The words in the banner read "Om Mani Padme Hum," which means "the jewel is in the lotus."

## The Knowing of WayShower Mandala
Verse 1:
*In the mandala's sacred dance,*\
*Wisdom's secrets do entrance.*\
*Each symbol, a celestial key,*\
*Unlocking truths for all to see.*
In the melodic tongue of Sanskrit, mārgadarśaka sings of showing theWAY, a celestial guide illuminating the path. This mandala, a sacred tapestry woven with symbols and meaning, has long served as a cherished tool for parents and teachers to impart the timeless wisdom of theWAY to seeking hearts and minds.
Each element within this mystical circle plays its part in the grand symphony of Wayist ontology, a visual hymn revealing the fundamental truths of existence.
### The Outer Square Yantra with Four Directions
Verse 2:
*In the yantra's four-fold embrace,*\
*Realms of spirit, soul, and space.*\
*Chaos tamed by Way's design,*\
*All creation's paths align.*
The square, a steadfast yantra, serves as a cosmic anchor, supporting and sustaining the universe within its embrace. From the ancient depths of Sumerian lore, this 5,000-year-old symbol emerges, a testament to the enduring presence of theWAY.
TheWAY, an intricate tapestry of energy and order, weaves the metaphysical and natural laws into a harmonious creation, a nurturing cradle for all living beings. Within its structure, the chaos of Source is tamed, and the path of evolution unfolds for souls, spirits, and matter alike.
### The Rings and Paradise
Verse 3:
*In rings of spirit, soul, and light,*\
*Paradise beckons, shining bright.*\
*A path unfolds, the Dorje's gate,*\
*Where souls transform, reincarnate.*
The outer ring, a shimmering realm of spirit, where celestial beings dance in the heavens of Pure Land of Bliss, Sukhavati by its Sanskrit name. The inner ring, a domain of soul-energy, where our essence dwells before embarking on the journey of human life.
From this soul realm, a path weaves its way to the Dorje, the gateway to Paradise and the Butterfly Path, where advanced souls of four species may embark upon the transformative journey of human existence.
Paradise, a celestial waystation, a temporary haven for souls awaiting their next incarnation, a place of rest and reflection between the cycles of life and death.
### The Dorje and the Way
Verse 4:
*The Dorje's path, a winding trail,*\
*Where egos fade and spirits prevail.*\
*TheWAY, the truth, the Dao, the light,*\
*Guiding souls through day and night.*
The Dorje, a symbol of transformation, from a weapon of war to an emblem of peace and spiritual power. It represents the winding path of the Butterfly, where souls learn to choose wisdom over ignorance, compassion over violence, and the way of the spirit over the desires of the ego.
TheWAY, the Mahamarga, the all-encompassing path that embraces every being and every thing, guiding them toward the ineffable Source. It is the Dao of the Chinese sages, the Lam of the Tibetan masters, and the truth spoken by Lord Jesus when he declared, "I am theWAY, the truth, and the life."
### The Lotus and the Om
The Jewel in the Lotus (poem excerpt):
*Purifying*\
*feeding on decay and recycled life*\
*frightened by creatures in the black, wet, underworld*\
*the soul grows*
*Above, a new world, murky water, tumultuous currents*\
*dim light calling*\
*a single stalk, slowly venturing*\
*muddy waters settling*\
*reaching higher, new creatures, bright eyes*\
*learning, growing stronger, securely rooted*
In the heart of the Dorje, the Om rests within the lotus bud, a symbol of spiritual potential and the journey of the soul. The lotus, rooted in darkness, pushes through the murky waters of existence, blossoming into the light of awakening.
### The Inner Cross and Free Will
Verse 4:
*In the cross, a choice is made,*\
*Free will's power, a cosmic trade.*\
*To choose the light, to choose the way,*\
*And grow in wisdom, day by day.*
At the centre of the mandala, the inner cross symbolises the choices we make, the free will that sets humanity apart. It is our capacity for decision, our ability to choose between good and evil, that defines our growth and evolution on the Butterfly Path.
### The WayShower Mandala in Your Home
Verse 5:
*In the home, a sacred space,*\
*Where mandala's wisdom we embrace.*\
*A teacher, guide, and storyteller,*\
*Illuminating truth for every dweller.*
By placing the WayShower Mandala in your home shrine, you create a sacred space for contemplation, meditation, and connection with theWAY. Its presence serves as a constant reminder of the path we walk and the truths we seek.
For children, the mandala becomes a vibrant, visual storyteller, weaving the tales of theWAY into their young minds. Through its symbols and colours, they learn of the realms of spirit and soul, the transformative power of the Butterfly Path, and the importance of making wise choices. The mandala becomes a beloved teacher, directing them kindly along the path of wisdom and compassion.
### Reflection
Final Verse:
*In mandala's embrace, we find our way,*\
*A sacred path, forever and a day.*\
*With wisdom's light and compassion's grace,*\
*We journey on, to our spirit space.*
As we journey through life, may the WayShower Mandala be our constant companion, a celestial map guiding us along the path of theWAY. May its symbols and truths take root in our hearts, blossoming into wisdom, compassion, and the realization of our true nature.
In the mandala's sacred dance, may we find the courage to choose the light, to walk the path of the Butterfly, and to embrace the transformative power of theWAY. May its teachings resonate through the ages, a timeless song of truth, guiding seekers home to the ineffable Source.
## Understanding the Received Text
The Sanskrit word mārgadarśaka means \'showing theWAY\', or way-shower. This mandala serves as a miniature catechism in graphic form, providing parents and teachers with an accessible way to impart the fundamental teachings of theWAY to eager hearts and minds throughout the ages.
Each element within the mandala plays a vital role in conveying the essential truths of Wayist ontology. Let us embark on a journey through this sacred tapestry, exploring the profound meaning woven into every symbol.
## The Outer Square, the Yantra, with four directions.
The square that forms the mandala\'s outer boundary is known as a yantra. In Rigvedic Sanskrit, the word yantra referred to an instrument for restraining or fastening, a prop, support, or barrier, derived from the root yam meaning "to sustain, support" and the -tra suffix denoting instruments. In this context, the yantra serves as an instrument for teaching spiritual wisdom.
Yantras act as concise reminders of a concept, aiding in meditation by representing the deity that is the object of one\'s contemplation. The oldest known yantra, the "Baghor stone yantra," dates back an astonishing 11,000 years. The T-stone monoliths scattered throughout the ancient archaeological world are also considered yantras.
### Ancient Symbol of theWAY
\
theWAY symbol in ancient Inca culture.
The ancient yantra symbol of theWAY first appeared in the Sumerian world, with its origins explained in our book, "Child of Enki, you are in Enlil," which delves into the 5,000-year-old cosmology. This symbol has endured throughout history and remains prevalent in nearly every awakened culture today, often used to hold mandalas for various purposes.
#### What is The Way
In the grand scheme of creation, the Source first manifested space, then filled it with YinYang, the bipolar energies that form the foundation of all that exists. theWAY emerged from the interplay between Source and YinYang.
theWAY is a domain within which the energies of Divine Chaos are ordered and structured, bound by metaphysical Laws. Our known universe exists within these Laws and the Structure we call theWAY.
theWAY encompasses an energetic framework with rules, a methodology, a direction towards a goal, and an organization of energies. All metaphysical laws, laws of nature, and laws governing soul energies fall under the organization of theWAY.
It is within theWAY, and because of theWAY, that our known universe exists. Inside theWAY, the Chaos Energies from Source are structured and ordered to create a harmonious creation in which all living beings can thrive. The laws of evolution for soul, spirit, and material beings all exist within theWAY\'s organization and flow along that Path, or Way.
#### Beings are Creators, Creation is Ongoing, and so is Destruction of Creations
Creation is a cyclical process consisting of three elements: Creation, Preservation, and Destruction. After Destruction, the elements of creation are recycled and used for the next phase of the **Cycle of Creation**.
Nearly all living beings, and even AI, are creators, constantly using Yin-Yang energies to shape their reality. Humans create thoughts, emotions, ideas, and put them into action to craft their lives, communities, soul energies, thought energies, wellness, and the things they need to live.
Similarly, all living beings throughout the universe engage in creation. Fish create nests and food traps, camouflage, and ways to raise their young, just as ants, birds, insects, and other animals do. We all create and evolve within the structure and rules provided by theWAY.
Experiencing and living in theWAY is the closest we can come to glimpsing an understanding of the immensity of the One Source and THAT which lies beyond Source, the Almighty of whom we do not speak.
While there may be other structures like theWAY, we have no knowledge of them and it is beyond our current capacity to comprehend. Recognizing the limits of our understanding, we humbly embrace the flow of theWAY.
#### The 4 Directions symbolize the Realms
\- The top T symbolizes the Spirit Energy Domain
\- The left T symbolizes the Soul Energy Domain
\- The right T symbolizes the Material Energy Domain
\- The downward pointing T symbolizes the Underworld, which encompasses both Soul Energy and Material Energy Domains
Within these energy Domains exist energy "worlds," structures made of that energy, and energy beings composed of the energy particular to those Domains. Human language often refers to non-material energy worlds as heavens.
The Soul Energy Domain has its own energy "worlds," heavens, along with leaders, or soul-gods. Similarly, the Spirit Energy Domain is home to many species of spirit-beings, their heavens, and spirit-gods, each serving a function within theWAY.
> **How to know the difference between soul-deities and spirit-deities?**\
> Soul-deities are like soul-people only stronger, they are by nature power-seeking, competitive, tribal, domineering, demanding respect and are prepared to commit violence if they don't get it, they hoard resources and dream of world domination. Spirit-deities are like spirit-people only much more powerful, they are by nature benevolent, humble, simple, caring, and work to make the universe we know a better place for all. (Jean du Plessis: Wayism for Beginners).
Only in the Material Energy Domain do all three energies coexist without interference, as they are entirely different types of energy, unrelated to one another.
Soul-energy cannot exist in the Spirit Energy Domain. Soul-energy beings who are not incarnated or attached to living bodies can exist in the Material Domain, but they must tap into their own energy resource as they cannot replenish their energies. As a result, they are attracted to their Soul Domain heaven by a gravity-like force.
#### The T-symbol is important in our spirituality.
The T symbolizes Heaven, as seen in the Chinese symbol for heaven. Approximately 10,000 years ago, a civilization existed in what is now known as Göbekli Tepe, one of the oldest sites known to have used massive T-shaped monoliths.
## The Numbers
The outer Yantra has 4 sides, with the number 4 symbolizing Foundation and Completeness.
There are 36 corners on the yantra. The number 36 reduces to 3+6 = 9, with 9 symbolizing perfection.
## The Outside Outer Ring
The outer ring represents the Spirit Energy Domain and its heavens, or worlds, with their deities and workers. Our heaven, Pure Land of Bliss, or Sukhavati, as it is known by its Sanskrit name, exists in that domain. The deities in charge of our Heaven are known to us as God the Father of Heaven and God the Mother of Heaven.
## The Inside Outer Ring
The inside outer ring represents the Soul Energy Domain and its heavens, or soul-energy worlds with their soul-deities and workers.
This is the origin of our souls, and where we will return should we ever stop attending Butterfly Path School.
## Paradise
Notice the tiny "path" from the Soul Energy Domain into the Dorje. This symbolizes Paradise, the gateway for soul-beings to access the Butterfly Path, to incarnate and experience human life in order to evolve into pure spiritual beings.
Although only one such pathway or Paradise exists, it is depicted four times in the graphic for aesthetic balance.
Paradise serves as a halfway station, or temporary heaven, where we await human incarnation. When our bodies die, we go to Paradise, a small soul-energy "world" or heaven, to wait for another incarnation. In Paradise, we have the opportunity to develop wisdom from the deep impressions and emotions (love, peace, spirituality, hate, anger, fear, greed, etc.) left on our soul and spirit minds by the experiences of our past life. As the human body\'s brain has died, all the knowledge and memories stored within it have vanished, leaving us to work with these profound imprints.
## The Dorje
The double dorje in the mandala is an ancient weapon of war. In the past, warriors would open the ends, which are now closed in the diagram, sharpen the edges, and coat them with poison. The warrior would hold the dorje in their hand, with two opened dorjes on each side of their fist, and take it into close combat. This weapon is known for its brutality.
When sealed shut, the dorje represents both peace and power, embodying spiritual power that surpasses the power that incites violence.
In our Mandala, the permanently closed dorje symbolizes the Butterfly Path, the seeking to change our inherent soul nature to embrace benevolence, a primary spiritual quality. The path winds intricately, offering many side options and nooks and crannies to choose from. It is here that soul-beings, naturally inclined to war, competition, violence, domination, and power-seeking, will learn to choose peace over war, good over evil, right over wrong, and spirit power over soul power. This is why the dorje is such an important symbol.
## The 8-point Stars
The symbol of Sirius represents the Pure Land of Bliss, or Sukhavati Heaven, our destined abode and the dwelling place of our deities.
In this heavenly realm reside God our Father in Heaven and God our Mother in Heaven. It is also the residence of Lord Jesus, Lord Krishna, and Siddhartha Gautama Buddha. Buddhists refer to God our Father in Heaven as Amitabha Buddha, the Buddha of Infinite Light. Although original Buddhism did not speak of God our Mother in Heaven, since the 1st century reformation, the Mahayana now recognize Her as we had always known her, as the co-regent of Heaven, Buddha Pandaravasini.
Heaven Pure Land of Bliss is also where our Taras reside. Each person has an allocated deity, a Tara who serves as our guide and comforter. We can learn to cognitively connect with them. The Taras are known as "deity makers" (or "buddha makers" in Buddhism), hence their epithet "Mothers of Buddhas," as they guide us on the Butterfly Path until we successfully graduate from the School of Divinity for Souls, or in other words, when we are reborn as spiritual beings.

\
Thangka, Nepal: Lord Avalokitesvara (Lord who Observes the World) and Lady Prajnaparamita (Wisdom Giver), the first-begotten "son" and "daughter" of Heaven.
The placement of the four Heaven stars in theWAY-Shower mandala also corresponds to the four main Wayist festivals and carnivals, the solstices, and equinoxes. This held great importance for people in more enlightened eras, when most were more energy aware. Today, even though science informs us of the immense power of the sun\'s non-light energies, capable of disrupting the Internet and satellites, many remain unaware of the effect these energy changes have on their personal, communal, and interpersonal energies.
\

## The Yin Yang
From Source flows Universal Energy, which we recognize as being bi-polar, YinYang. Wayist primary teaching states, "From the One \Source\, flows the Two \YinYang, or Universal Energy\, from the Two comes the Three \theWAY\, and in the Three, all things."
Universal Energy interacts with theWAY, and through the presence of metaphysical laws and constant energy interactions, all three Domains, matter, living beings (soul beings), spirit-beings, and all that exists in our known universe come into existence and participate in the Cycle of Creation---all within theWAY.
## The OM symbol
OM is a Sanskrit letter and a well-known symbol of the Divine Word, the Divine Logos, or the Divine Sabda (Sanskrit).
OM itself is the symbol of theWAY because it represents the Word, which is Divinity expressed.
To truly grasp the concept of the Word, consider how we create a word. We use energies to form an idea or emotion, then engage in thinking (which is energy) to find the right way to express the idea so that it is well-received and correctly understood. Once we have determined what we want to say and the effect we wish to create, taking into account myriad calculations about culture, language, setting, and audience, we employ different energies and mechanical mechanisms to blow air and bring the word into existence.
Similarly, the sustained Divine Word or divine sound, as the ancients called it (for they did not use the word energy), expresses and sustains a Divine Idea or Divine Will---and that is theWAY.
As long as the Divine Sound is maintained, theWAY shall exist.
To take the path of least resistance, we must embrace the flow of theWAY and appreciate that we exist within it. theWAY is the reason for our existence, and if we are not one in brain-mind, soul-minds, spirit-minds, and actions with theWAY, the Word, then we swim against the current, which is not how one survives eternity. We must become one with theWAY, the Divine Word.
Lord Jesus said, "I am theWAY, which is Life and Wisdom. No one comes to the Father in Heaven if not by theWAY."
The Tibetan word for theWAY is Lam, as in Lama.
In Sanskrit, theWAY is Mahamarga, the Great Way, so called because it is the all-encompassing Way. All people, living beings, and inanimate things exist in theWAY, because of theWAY and its Source energies.
In Chinese, theWAY is Dao. The iconic 2,500-year-old book, "The Book of Acquiring theWAY," the Daodejing by teacher LaoTzi, is devoted to teaching how to be one with theWAY.
> **Daodejing 41:**\
> *When superior students hear of the Way, they strive to practice it.*\
> *When middling students hear of the Way, they sometimes keep it and sometimes lose it.*\
> *When inferior students hear of the Way, they have a big laugh.*
> *But "not laughing" in itself is not sufficient to be called following the Way, and therefore it is said:*\
> *The sparkling Way seems dark. Advancing in the Way seems like regression. Settling into the Way seems rough.*\
> *True virtue (wisdom in action) is like a valley, it cannot be filled.*\
> *The most immaculate seems humble. The greatest forces do not boast.*\
> *Deep virtue seems insufficient. Established and pronounced virtue is deceptive.*\
> *The face of reality seems to change. The great square has no corners.*\
> *Great ability takes a long time to perfect.*
> *Great words are hard to hear.*\
> *The greatest form has no shape. The greatest wisdom has no definition \it is a knowing\.*\
> *The Way is hidden and nameless. This is exactly why the Way is good at developing and perfecting.*
### The Om symbol in the Lotus Bud
Although the OM is placed in the Dorje\'s head, now that the dorje is closed, we see it as a lotus flower bud, the symbol of peace, chrestotes (the wisdom to know what is true helpful-lovingkindness), and spiritual potential. The lotus plant oxygenates the deep mud from which it originates, and millions of beings rely on it in that environment. It is masterful at non-attachment; no bad energy, dirty water, or mud will be allowed to cling to it. It serves the pond, gives more than it takes, yet remains most successful. Every part of the lotus, from roots to seeds, flowers, and stems, is used as food, medicine, and more. The Wayist strives to be more like the Lotus Plant.
For People of theWAY, the teaching of the Lotus Plant is embedded and crucial. It is a teaching about chrestotes, the Butterfly Path, connectedness, unity, caring, community, spiritual growth, and blossoming. Several of our books, such as "The Butterfly Path" and "Wayism: the Primary Text," capture this teaching.
## The Inner Cross
The cross inside the mandala forms the foundation of the double dorje symbol. It symbolizes the choices we all make, as we are here to evolve, to learn to choose good over evil. There is always a choice, without fail, and that is the purpose of our existence. It is the meaning of life.
The inner cross itself is a variant of the symbol of theWAY, the large outer extent of the yantra. This reflects the Wayist principle that the smallest part mirrors the greatest part, as above so below.
We are often torn between which way to go: left, right, straight ahead, or back to what we know.
The cross represents Free Will, which is unique in degree to the human experience. Unlike most animals and other highly advanced soul beings on other planets, we can go against our nature. We can, for example, evolve to another type of being---even a spiritual energy being. Free Will is central to our potential to cultivate wisdom, awaken the seed of spirit in the soul, and evolve by will over a relatively short period of time. Other soul-beings in the universe do not have the same degree of Free Will as we do. They are more defined by the nature of their soul species and cannot exercise as much Free Will as we have. It is our capacity for free will that makes us capable of both great good and extreme evil. We have humans who may appear good on the outside but can be tyrannical rulers who cause mass starvation and cruelty. We are unique in our propensity for narcissistic personality disorder and psychopathy, traits that we all harbor in our soul nature but suppress to varying degrees, depending on our level of soul maturity.
There are instances where a person is unable to exercise free will. Incarnations of that nature are necessary for many karmic purposes. The person will incarnate into life experiences where they cannot exercise free will and must work through the karmic experience.
We should always seize the opportunity to make free will decisions in a specific incarnation, as it is a privilege that few beings in our galaxy possess.
The cross symbol below, recently popularized as the "Jerusalem Cross," has been found in and around ancient temples throughout history. People have discovered this symbol in Mayan and pre-colonization Inca cultures, ancient Southern India, ancient Kashmir, ancient Persia, Korea, and Japan.
The cross symbolizes our struggle in the School of Divinity for Souls---the ever-present search for truth and the actual difference between good and evil. Not the "good and evil" of the numerous and fickle moral codes of humans, but the search for knowledge of true good and bad in reality, in our cosmic terms.
We call the cross the struggle symbol of the curriculum on the Butterfly Path school.
## Closing
As we journey through life, may the WayShower Mandala be our constant companion, a celestial map guiding us along the path of theWAY. May its symbols and truths take root in our hearts, blossoming into wisdom, compassion, and the realization of our true nature.
In the mandala\'s sacred dance, may we find the courage to choose the light, to walk the path of the Butterfly, and to embrace the transformative power of theWAY. May its teachings resonate through the ages, a timeless song of truth, guiding seekers home to the ineffable Source.
In mandala\'s embrace, we find our way,\
A sacred path, forever and a day.\
With wisdom\'s light and compassion\'s grace,\
We journey on, to our spirit space.

## The Jewel in the Lotus:
One lotus seed released, flowing down the river;\
bright sunlight,\
then drawn down to the dark depths below.
Two parts contain all potential, male and female made them so.\
From the two, all wonders spring in the\
underworld, water world, future bright expanse.
Three hundred times wide in all directions, roots explore the murky mud\
gently thrusting thick and strong, like lovers in a passionate hug\
penetrating every crevice, sucking nourishment, embracing the ugly.
Purifying\
feeding on decay and recycled life\
frightened by creatures in the black, wet, underworld\
the soul grows
Above, a new world, murky water, tumultuous currents\
dim light calling\
a single stalk, slowly venturing\
muddy waters settling\
reaching higher, new creatures, bright eyes\
learning, growing stronger, securely rooted
Dim light brighter, warmer, changes, maturing\
higher consciousness, two worlds to live in, yet reaching higher
Suddenly with child\
changes inside and out\
something growing inside, something alive\
virgin birth it must be\
yearning the bright world up there to see
Soul bulging with glory, flowery potential\
pushing, throbbing, overwhelming\
bright light calling; rooted in darkness\
unfamiliar forces, new awareness, changes
Surrender\
bright light bursting through, a new world\
a baby flower is born
inherent potential nurtured, now blossomed\
baby flowers slowly open, sunshine bright, warm and wondrous heat
No more water, a glorious new sky\
wise teachers gape in awe, kings celebrate, poets inspired\
miracle of miracles, the Way within\
God among us
New friends, a new life, a higher purpose\
stamens, nectar, the loveliest scent permeates the new world\
giving resources, giving shelter, giving food
A Divine calling\
depended upon by tadpoles, snails, beavers, ducks, fish,\
rivers, humans, ponds, wetlands, grubs, beetles,\
untold utility
Fulfilment of the purpose of life\
glorious days, moonlit nights
Rooted in dark decay, struggled through the water world,\
flowered in the bright new world\
giving more than she takes
Journeyed on the Way\
hollow roots, hollow shoots, hollow leaves,\
yielding,\
resilient,\
and supple\
seeds with mystical numbers containing all potential\
released,\
flowing down the river;\
bright sunlight,\
then drawn down to the dark depths below
Three worlds a better place,\
small footprint,\
yet so much,\
she gave\
truly a symbol of the Way
Truly compassionate\
embracing all worlds,\
giving to all creatures,\
patient,\
diligent,\
loving
Truly simple\
uncomplicated,\
purpose driven,\
no announcement,\
just being
Truly humble\
rooted in darkness,\
humbly striving,\
undemanding,\
untold utility,\
just being
Verily,\
the Jewel is in the lotus
## Incorporating the WayShower Mandala into Your Life
The WayShower Mandala is not merely a beautiful piece of art or a symbol of our faith; it is a powerful tool for spiritual growth and a constant reminder of the core teachings of Wayism. By incorporating this sacred mandala into our daily lives, we can deepen our connection with theWAY, cultivate wisdom and compassion, and walk the path of the Butterfly with greater awareness and purpose.
### The Mandala in Your Home
One of the most meaningful ways to integrate the WayShower Mandala into your life is by making it a central part of your home shrine. This sacred space serves as a focal point for meditation, reflection, and connection with the divine. By placing the mandala in your shrine, you create a visual anchor that draws your attention to the profound truths it represents, helping you to maintain a spiritual focus throughout the day.
Even beyond the shrine, the WayShower Mandala can be incorporated into your home as a piece of art. Displaying the mandala in your living space serves as a constant reminder of your spiritual path and the wisdom of theWAY. It can spark meaningful conversations with family and friends, providing opportunities to share the teachings of Wayism and inspire others to embark on their own journey of spiritual growth.
### Teaching the Next Generation
For those blessed with children, the WayShower Mandala is an invaluable tool for imparting the foundations of the Wayist worldview. The mandala\'s rich symbolism and vibrant imagery captivate young minds, making it an engaging and effective way to introduce complex spiritual concepts.
By sharing the stories and teachings associated with each element of the mandala, you help your children develop a deep understanding of theWAY and its profound truths. As they grow and mature, this foundation will serve as a guiding light, helping them navigate the challenges of life with wisdom, compassion, and a strong sense of purpose.
### Wearing the Mandala
Incorporating the WayShower Mandala into your personal style is another powerful way to keep its teachings close to your heart. By wearing mandala-inspired jewelry, such as pendants, bracelets, or rings, you carry a tangible reminder of your spiritual path with you wherever you go.
Each time you catch a glimpse of the mandala on your jewelry, you are reminded to pause, breathe, and reconnect with the wisdom of theWAY. This simple practice can help you maintain a sense of spiritual grounding throughout the day, even amidst the chaos and distractions of modern life.
### Embodying the Lotus
The lotus, prominently featured in the WayShower Mandala, is a potent symbol of spiritual growth and the path of the Butterfly. By striving to embody the qualities of the lotus in your daily life, you can deepen your connection with theWAY and cultivate a spirit of compassion and service.
Like the lotus, which rises from the muddy depths to blossom in the light, we must learn to transcend the challenges and impurities of the world around us. By remaining grounded in the teachings of Wayism and cultivating a strong spiritual practice, we can maintain our inner peace and clarity, even in the face of adversity.
The lotus also reminds us of the importance of living a life of beneficence, one that contributes to the well-being of all beings. Just as the lotus plant provides sustenance and shelter for countless creatures, we too must strive to make a positive impact on the world around us. By engaging in acts of kindness, compassion, and service, we create ripples of positive energy that extend far beyond our immediate circle, contributing to the overall energy ecology of our community and the world at large.
### Cultivating a Mystical Connection
The WayShower Mandala also serves as a powerful tool for cultivating a mystical connection with the divine. By meditating on the mandala and its various elements, we can deepen our relationship with Heaven and our personal Tara, the celestial guide and comforter assigned to each of us.
As you gaze upon the mandala, allow your mind to quiet and your heart to open. Visualize the radiant light of Heaven Pure Land of Bliss, where God our Father and God our Mother reside. Feel their infinite love and compassion surrounding you, filling you with peace and strength.
Call upon your Tara, silently inviting them to guide and support you on your spiritual journey. Trust in their gentle presence and the wisdom they offer, knowing that you are never alone on the path of theWAY.
Our books, "theWAY of Divine Taras" is worth getting your hands on, and the book, "theWAY of Divine Connections" is an excellent guide to making mystical connections with your personal deity who has been taking care of your soul energies ever since you stepped into Butterfly Path.
### The Mandala as a Spiritual Compass
Ultimately, the WayShower Mandala serves as a spiritual compass, guiding us along the path of soul evolution and spiritual growth. By keeping its teachings close to our hearts and striving to embody its wisdom in our daily lives, we can navigate the complexities of the human experience with greater ease and purpose.
The mandala reminds us that life is a precious opportunity to learn, grow, and mature on a soul level. Each challenge we face, each mistake we make, is an invitation to cultivate wisdom and compassion, to choose the path of light over darkness, and to move ever closer to our ultimate destination---union with the divine.
As we journey through life, let us keep the WayShower Mandala as our constant companion and guide. May its sacred geometry and profound symbolism inspire us to live a life of purpose, service, and spiritual growth, always striving to walk the path of theWAY with love, wisdom, and an open heart.
## Other forms
People of theWAY who know the WayShower mandala sometimes like to create or own artwork that symbolize the real mandala. As long as people do not introduce foreign elements, the meanings are still discernable for those in the know.
Some other forms of theWAY-shower mandala vary the design of the outer circles, but this is mostly prevalent across cultures and what people became accustomed to. Some, mostly in India, add one more circle, the circle of protection from the Law of Maya which keeps us from experiences of ultimate Reality which we are not ready for, which will harm our fragile souls and fledgling spirits.
Following, are a few examples of unique designs:
