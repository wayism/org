## Authenticity is Simply Enough Beauty
Once upon a time, in a bustling village nestled in the heart of a lush valley, there lived a carpenter named Enzo. He was known far and wide for his exquisite craftsmanship, his keen eye for detail, and his uncanny ability to coax beauty out of the most humble of materials.
One day, a wealthy merchant visited Enzo's workshop, seeking a gift for his daughter's wedding. The merchant's eyes roamed over the gleaming, polished pieces on display, but nothing caught his fancy. Enzo, sensing the merchant's discontent, asked him to wait a moment. He disappeared into the back of his shop and returned with a simple, worn wooden box.
The merchant, perplexed, watched as Enzo opened the box with reverent hands. Inside, nestled on a bed of faded velvet, was an ancient-looking wooden spoon. Its handle smooth and shiny from decades of use, its bowl slightly misshapen from countless stirrings, the old wood showing its nature and species. Enzo lifted it out and held it up to the light.
"This," he said softly, "is udbhu-kanti."
The merchant frowned. "It's just an old spoon," he said. "I need something special, something perfect for my daughter."
Enzo smiled. "Ah, but you see, this spoon is perfect. Look at the patina on the handle, earned from years of loving hands. See the indents from being held closely and working hard. See the slight charring on the underside, a testament to the hearty meals it has helped prepare. This here, a small chip out the side, now smoothed from wear, an accident, a story the kitchen still recalls after all so many years. This spoon has been a silent witness and participant to heart family meals, watching the kids grow up, it disciplined children, it witnessed laughter and tears as the family moved through the phases of life, it was there witnessing births and deaths, the ebb and flow of life itself. In its imperfections, it is more perfect than any gleaming bauble, it is a testament to the importance of family, interpersonal connection, hearty nutrition. It lovingly stirred brews of herbal medicines that infused its wood, it stirred jams and preserves, it made soups to warm the soul of workers coming home in bitter winter nights, it made broth when the children have flu, see its markings, it has soul, it has stories, it represents everything that is wholesome in a household."
The merchant looked closer and, as if seeing through new eyes, began to perceive the beauty Enzo described. The spoon seemed to glow with an inner light as if a soul of its own, its story and its path etched into every worn curve, small crack, and smooth plane.
"This," Enzo continued, "is the essence of udbhu-kanti. It is the understanding that true beauty, true value, comes not from polished flawlessness but from authenticity. Just as a river stone is polished to a sheen by the currents of time, so too does life burnish us with experience, leaving us more beautiful for having been tumbled about."
The merchant, his eyes now shining with understanding, nodded slowly. "I see," he said. "I have been blind, but now I understand. This spoon, with all its imperfections, is the perfect gift. It carries the wisdom of ages, the love of generations. It is a reminder that the most precious things in life are too often overlooked and underappreciated."
Enzo smiled and carefully placed the spoon back in its box. "Take it," he said. "Give it to your daughter with my blessings. And remember, whenever you look at it, to see with the eyes of udbhu-kanti. For therein lies the secret to true happiness and contentment."
The merchant left the shop with the box clutched to his heart, a moistness in his eyes, a smile playing about his lips. And from that day forward, he began to see the world anew - not as a collection of things to be acquired and discarded, but as a tapestry of stories, each thread made more beautiful by the passage of time.
So, my friend, I ask you: when was the last time you paused to appreciate the wear patterns on a favorite wooden spoon - each scratch and stain a testament to the nourishing meals it has helped prepare? When did you last look in the mirror and see, not flaws, but the roadmap of a life well-lived? Embracing udbhu-kanti doesn't mean eschewing the new or disdaining the shiny. It simply means understanding that worth has many wellsprings, and some of the deepest pour from the seasoned and timeworn.
Udbhu-kanti is a concept central to the Wayist philosophy. At its core, it is the worldview that authenticity and character are the foundations of true beauty. In terms of how we experience life, this ancient saying encapsulates the philosophy of theWAY and the concept of udbhu-kanti: "We do not measure a human lifetime in years, but in moments of significant experiences."
The udbhu-kanti worldview and lifestyle inspire us to purposefully seek and generate more significant encounters by cherishing the intrinsic character, history, and authentic essence of objects, be it a worm, butterfly, driftwood, care-made balsamic vinegar, or a person. We look for moments to connect with the genuine beauty in things and people.
We love to "read" the history and path of things, inhaling the musty scent of old books and feeling the delicate texture of aged parchment. Like tracing our fingers over the cracks and worn edges of an ancient artifact. We acknowledge that even the tiniest moments in life hold significance, contributing to our personal growth and development. The roadmap of our scars and past sorrows reveals the strength we gained while overcoming hurdles, adding depth to our character and intrinsic beauty. Therefore, we feel it is important to honour the character of others, embracing the visible reminders of past hardships on our skin, just as we cherish the visible repairs on an old but loved piece of furniture, the tea-pot with its charming dent and the old rag doll with its carefully stitched repairs.
In the tapestry of a life well-lived, every snag and fray adds to the richness of the weave. Udbhu-kanti invites us to cherish the whole cloth, not despite the wear but because of it.
Take, for example, the chipped china cup, passed down through generations. It was proud of its story-telling imperfections. 'Flawless is boring,' it seemed to say with a wink. The gold-threaded cracks in its porcelain, repaired with the ancient art of kintsugi, only added to its beauty. Each glinting seam whispered of a mishap, a clumsy moment, a heartfelt apology. The cup was more beautiful for having been broken.
And what of the old oak tree in the town square? Its gnarled branches and weather-beaten bark told a thousand tales. Children had climbed its limbs, lovers had carved their initials into its trunk, families had picnicked under its leafy canopy. The tree wore its scars like medals of honor, each one a testament to a life intertwined with the community it sheltered, the ribbons of celebrations that were draped. It remembers children sitting on its thick branches, some dreaming daydreams of wonder, some working through their emotions of life's disappointments. It has raised a community and carries with it the wisdom of bird families growing up, generations of squirrels it knows by name and recalls their quirks, it has seen political parties and good and bad governments come and go. It has known cycles of heat and drought, flood and cold, it has lived life, and it shows.
Udbhu-kanti teaches us to look at the world with new eyes, to see the extraordinary in the ordinary. It's about finding the poetry in the prosaic, the magic in the mundane. When we learn to appreciate the beauty of imperfection, we open ourselves up to a world of wonder.
But this perspective isn't just about aesthetics. It's about recognizing the value of resilience, of endurance, of the hard-won wisdom that only comes from weathering life's storms. When we look at an elderly face etched with lines, we're not seeing the ravages of time but the etchings of experience. Each wrinkle is a story, each silver hair a badge of courage.
In a world that often prizes the new and the perfect, udbhu-kanti is a breath of fresh air. It's a reminder that true beauty is not skin-deep, that value is not determined by shine. It's an invitation to look deeper, to appreciate more fully, to love more completely.
We are ancient souls with a long history on this planet, and the udbhu-kanti mindset embraces the wealth of wisdom of our ancient selves. Udbhu-kanti is our rootedness in our very temporary, fast aging, soon to be dying body, and our soul's history on this planet. So how can we cultivate udbhu-kanti in our daily lives? It's simple, really. Start by taking a moment each day to notice and appreciate something that has been made more meaningful by the passage of time. It could be a frayed friendship bracelet, a dog-eared book, a laugh line etched from years of mirth. A stretch mark, a scar. Pause. Reflect. Allow yourself to be filled with gratitude for the story woven into these imperfections.
Next, try to extend this perspective to the people around you. Instead of seeing flaws, look for the beauty of authenticity. Appreciate the quirks, the idiosyncrasies, the unique qualities that make each person a one-of-a-kind work of art. Remember that we are all works in progress, our rough edges being smoothed by the sands of time.
Finally, turn this lens on yourself. Embrace your own imperfections, your own battle scars. They are not blemishes but badges of honor, proof that you have lived, loved, and learned. Your story is etched into every line and curve of your being. Wear it with pride, and a smile in your heart. And if you see how shallow-others judge things, always remember there are always junior students in this School of Divinity for Souls, and they simply do not yet have your capacity for wisdom.
Imagine how different our lives would be if we looked at ourselves, our possessions, and our world with the eyes of udbhu-kanti --- seeking out the beauty in the battered, the wisdom in the weathered, the stories in the scars. Therein lies the true wealth, just waiting to be treasured.
So lets go forth, and explore more about how udbhu-kanti makes us see the world anew. For in embracing the imperfect, you may just find the key to a life perfectly lived.

## The Essence of Udbhu-Kanti
In the hustle and bustle of modern life, it's easy to get caught up in the idealistic pursuit of some elusive "perfection". Its a trap we were lured into, and we took the bait. We're bombarded with images of flawless faces, pristine possessions, and the allure of the shiny and new --- and even though we know darn right that they who possess those things are downright unhappy, we still worship at that altar. But what if true beauty, true value, lay somewhere else entirely? What if the key to a life well-lived was found not in the glossy and unblemished, but in the weathered and worn?
At its heart, udbhu-kanti is about finding beauty and worth in the imperfect, the authentic, the things that bear the marks of time and experience. It's a perspective that celebrates the cracks, the creases, and the patina that come from a life well-lived.
The word "udbhu-kanti" itself is a fusion of two ancient Sanskrit terms. "Udbhu" means authentic, real, and true to its essence. "Kanti," on the other hand, refers to beauty, radiance, and charm. Together, they form a concept that points to the profound allure of things that are genuinely themselves, unsullied by pretense or artifice.
To understand udbhu-kanti, think of your favorite pair of jeans. When you first bought them, they were stiff and uniform, identical to countless others on the rack. But as you wore them, they began to mold to your shape. Each crease, each fade, each frayed edge told a story --- of adventures had, of memories made, of jobs done, of projects finished, of parties and pleasure, of a life being lived. Those jeans, with all their imperfections, now supple and easily yielding to changes, became uniquely yours, a second skin imbued with the essence of your experiences.
This is the power of udbhu-kanti - the recognition that true beauty is not about surface-level perfection, but about the rich tapestry of stories, experiences, and emotions that make us who we are. It's about cherishing the marks of a life well-lived, whether they be laugh lines etched around sparkling eyes, a nose not so straight anymore after that fall off the back of a pickup truck, the well-worn pages of a beloved book, the scar on the forehead attesting to the awesomeness of having siblings, or the nicks and scratches on a family heirloom. We're not afraid to live well and deep and hard. We joy and awe and hurt like heck and fall and get up and heal --- and so we become wise and form true character.
In a world that often feels plastic and disposable, udbhu-kanti is a call to authenticity. It's an invitation to see beauty as that which is real, the raw, the "imperfect" as the shallow world would say. It's a reminder that our scars, our quirks, our idiosyncrasies are not flaws to be hidden but testimonies to be celebrated.
We don't go around wearing cake makeup masks of fake this and fake that, because we are not yet deceased, we're celebrating life, not our funeral. We leave the fakeness to the mortician's art of hiding reality. We don't want to hide our character, our story, our true essence --- because we don't really like pretense as a lifestyle element.
So how do we cultivate udbhu-kanti in our lives? It starts with a shift in perspective, a willingness to look beyond the surface and appreciate the depth of things. It means learning to see the stories etched in the lines of a weathered face; the love stitched into a child's lumpy first attempt at making your birthday card; the memories seeped into the walls of a well-lived-in home.
It's about cherishing the things that are made more meaningful by the passage of time. It's about finding beauty in the battered, wisdom in the weathered, and value in the vintage. It's about understanding that true worth comes not from flawlessness, but from the rich patina of experience.
In the following chapters, we'll dive deeper into the world of udbhu-kanti. We'll explore how this concept can transform the way we see ourselves, our possessions, and the world around us. We'll discover how embracing imperfection can lead to a richer, more authentic, and ultimately more beautiful life.

## Udbhu-Kanti in Everyday Objects
In the grand tapestry of life, it's often the little things that hold the most meaning. An old coffee mug, a well-worn pair of shoes, a tarnished locket --- these everyday objects, so easily overlooked, are the unsung heroes of our stories. They are the quiet keepers of our memories, the tangible ties to our pasts, and the embodiments of udbhu-kanti in our daily lives.
Consider for a moment my old pickup, my only vehicle. Not just any pickup, but one that has lived more than two decades of Canadian winters, countless people transported to beach-side BBQs, family road trips, and weekends in Toronto, tailgating at music festivals in Michigan, her privacy violated by many a Border Services officer's impolite fingering probes in till-then unspoken crevices, countless moments of love and laughter, listening to hours of complaining about stupid drivers on the road, and so often parked next to brand new sickly expensive cars which employees and tenants bought on credit. The grip of familiar hands wore its steering wheel and gearshift smooth, its body slightly misshapen from years of living life exactly as a little pickup would want to. To the untrained eye, it may seem like just an old pickup, ready to be discarded for something newer, shinier, traded for \$4,000. But to me, it has another 20 years of life in it. It may need a hip transplant, I may have to nurse it through a heart attack, and its joints creak --- but we grew old together, she's family and we have a lot of history together.
But to the eye of udbhu-kanti, that pickup which cost \$19,000 brand new and is now a proud grandfather, a treasure. Each mark upon it tells a story --- of contributing to the family's wealth and wholesomeness, celebrating life with us as we grew in wisdom, as we went through terrible hardships and fantastic joys. The pickup's rust repair patches, dents and scratches and two lost wheel caps, are not flaws, but rather the very things that make it perfect. They are the proof of its history, its service, its place in the heart of a home. The worn hinge of the back gate, which makes my spouse need me to open it for her, is the pickup's way of keeping me relevant in the family and that is why I don't repair it.
The same can be said for so many of the objects we surround ourselves with. The quilt, patched together from scraps of old clothing, each square a reminder of a moment in time. The writing desk, its wood polished to a sheen by countless sweaty palms seeking to infuse meaning to a page, the leather recliner with shiny parts for that particular butt shape and stains of soup and coffee that should not have been balanced on one's lap. The old books, their pages yellowed and dog-eared, each crease or folded corner, a marker of a passage that spoke to the soul. The indelible ink-spot on the priceless hand-woven rug you bought in the Himalaya mountains from Wayist monks, a beautiful reminder of the joys of having grandchildren.
These things, in all their worn and weathered glory, are the physical embodiments of stories. They are reminders that life is not about the destination, but about the journey --- a journey marked by use, by love, by the inevitable wear and tear of experience.
In a world that often prioritizes the new and the flawless, udbhu-kanti invites us to see the beauty in things that have been lovingly used. It encourages us to cherish the objects that have stood the test of time, that have lived with real people through thick and thin. It reminds us that true value comes not from perfection, but from the rich patina and wear of a life well-lived.
So how can we incorporate this perspective into our daily lives? Start by taking a closer look at the objects you surround yourself with. Instead of seeing only their surface-level appearance, try to see the stories they hold. That chipped mug? It's not just a vessel for your morning coffee --- it's a reminder of all the quiet moments of reflection you've had, the sunrises and birds awakening, cradling it in your hands, nurturing a hangover, of the mercury slowly leeching into your morning brew from the chip --- by grace dimming the brain's overthinking. Those scuffed shoes? They're not just footwear --- they're the faithful companions that have shaped themselves to you, carried you through countless adventures, seen the path you walked, heard the yarns you spun and slipped in the rain, probably just for a laugh.
By learning to appreciate the udbhu-kanti in everyday objects, we infuse our lives with greater meaning. We see the extraordinary in the ordinary, the beauty in the imperfect. We cultivate a deeper sense of gratitude for the things we have, and a richer understanding of the stories that have shaped us.
So next time you're tempted to replace something old with something new, pause for a moment. Consider the stories that old object holds, the memories it has witnessed, the love it has felt. Perhaps, the old just needs cleaning, care, and a more prominent place in the home. In cherishing the udbhu-kanti of the things we surround ourselves with, we not only honor our pasts --- we enrich our presents and inspire our futures, and we don't buy the synthetic new thing.
For it is in the imperfect, the weathered, the handled and hand-made, and the well-loved that we find the true treasures of life. And in learning to see with the eyes of udbhu-kanti, we unlock a world of beauty that has been there all along, just waiting to be discovered.

## Udbhu-Kanti in Nature
In the hushed whisper of the wind through ancient trees, in the craggy face of a mountain that has stood sentinel for millennia, in the delicate petals of a wildflower pushing through the cracks of a sidewalk --- udbhu-kanti is alive and thriving in the natural world around us.
Nature, in all its untamed and imperfect glory, is perhaps the greatest teacher of udbhu-kanti. It shows us that beauty is not about conformity or flawlessness, but about authenticity, resilience, and the unique character born from a life fully lived.
Take, for example, a gnarled old oak tree. Its trunk is twisted and scarred, its bark rough and weathered. To some, it may seem past its prime, a mere shadow of the straight and smooth sapling it once was. But to the eye of udbhu-kanti, that tree is a marvel. Each knot and burl in its wood tells a story --- of storms weathered, of droughts endured, hard winters, fire, the blight of 1972, the heartache when its soul mate was out by lightning on that fateful night, and the relentless march of time --- is what makes it special, and perfect. Its very imperfections are what make it perfect, a testament to its character, strength, and endurance. There is no comparing it to the arrogant young sapling oak growing in its shade --- it's just a kid, handsome and smooth, yes --- but it has a long way to go to become deeply beautiful. Now, it's just young.
The same can be said for a wildflower meadow. It's not a manicured garden with each bloom carefully cultivated and arranged. Instead, it's a riot of color and life, a glorious jumble of growth and blossoms in every shape and hue. Interspersed are thorns and thistles, herbs that do not flower but heal, and food for caterpillars, butterflies, bees, and beetles. Some flowers may be bigger or brighter than others, some may be slightly wilted or past their peak, others now past flowering but ripening their seeds. But together, in all their wild and unruly beauty, they create a masterpiece that takes the breath away --- for those who know how to look.
This is the essence of udbhu-kanti --- the understanding that true beauty is found not in artificial perfection, but in the authentic and the natural. It's a reminder that we, too, are part of nature --- imperfect, yet exquisite in our own unique ways.
When we learn to see the world through the lens of udbhu-kanti, we start to appreciate the beauty in the natural cycle of life. We understand that the wrinkles on an elderly face are not signs of decay, but rather the etchings of wisdom and experience. We see that the cracks in a sidewalk are not blemishes, but rather opportunities for new life to take root and flourish. We may even defy convention and allow the lawn to host food for other soul beings and nature's flowers.
Udbhu-kanti teaches us to find grace in the impermanent, the imperfect, the cycles of life, and the ever-changing. It invites us to embrace the natural ebb and flow of existence, to find peace in the knowledge that all things, in time, must return to the earth whence they came. We embrace that the human body is a dying entity, and it approaches its end with honor, grace, victory, wisdom, and deep, deep stories that built a wealth of character. We look forward to flowing into Paradise one day to sit down with friends, toast them with whatever spirit they drink in spirit places, and share the tales of yet another life lived well.
So how can we cultivate this perspective in our own lives? One way is to spend more time in nature, observing and appreciating its untamed beauty. Take a walk in the woods and marvel at the gnarled roots, the weathered bark, scratch around to observe the magnitude of wealth and life in the soil below the leaves. See their struggles past and joys of new shoots. So, not only a walk. Sit down and look what all is happening between your legs --- a tiny jungle of wholesomeness happens right there. Of course you can let your mind go there too, but right now we're talking about something else --- a later chapter deals with personal hygiene. Sit in the park and watch the insects, and feel the hum of centuries-old communities of living beings beneath your feet.
As we immerse ourselves in the natural world, we start to internalize its lessons. We learn to see the beauty in the imperfect, the wisdom in the weathered, the grace in the fleeting. We understand that, like the wildflower or the tree, we too are part of a greater cycle --- one that encompasses birth and death, growth and decay, the constant unfurling of life in all its messy, magnificent glory.
In embracing the udbhu-kanti of nature, we not only deepen our appreciation for the world around us --- we also learn to extend that same compassion and acceptance to ourselves. We start to see our own imperfections not as flaws, but as the very things that make us unique, authentic, and breathtakingly beautiful.
So let us take our cue from the wild and untamed world around us. Let us learn to see with the eyes of udbhu-kanti to find beauty in the battered, grace in the gnarled, and wisdom in the weathered. For it is in nature's imperfect perfection that we may just find the key to our own.

## Udbhu-Kanti in Ourselves
Just as we learn to see the beauty in the imperfections of the world around us, so too must we learn to embrace the udbhu-kanti within ourselves. We are, each of us, a living testament to the joys and sorrows, the triumphs, and challenges, the loves and losses that have shaped our lives. Our scars, our wrinkles, our quirks --- these are not flaws to be hidden or erased, but rather the very things that make us unique, authentic, and breathtakingly human --- and in that lies our true beauty. We are not the emotions that the soul wallows in, or the mental programming job our culture did on our brains --- we are the wisdom we extracted from memories of life experiences. And, we are not done percolating those memories. There's more wisdom to distill from that brew.
You will be old for three times longer as it takes to get over the deep limitations of your 20's, and for three times as long as it takes to get over the lack of awareness of your 30's. You will be "old" by the standards of popular speak, for longer than your youth will last --- so acquire the necessary life skills to have a full and beautiful, meaningful, and purposeful life when you are "old". Life begins at 40. From 40 to 90 is what life is truly all about. Being young sucks so badly. All "old" people look back to how sure, uninformed, unwise, and unready they were for life when they were saplings.
In a society that often prizes that fleeting and fast-decaying youth with its so-cherished smoothness and uniformity, it can be easy to fall into the trap of seeing our own selves as imperfections against those commercial standards, as something to be ashamed of. We may look in the mirror and fret to see only the lines around our eyes, blemishes on the skin, the silver in our hair, thinning hair, hair-like air roots in places never before known, the scars on our skin and soul. But through the lens of udbhu-kanti, these are not blemishes --- they are badges of honor, each one telling the story of a life fully lived. Except of course, for those air-root hairs, ask your partner to trim or plat them; they may not be there for good reason.
Those laugh lines etched around your eyes? They are a testament to all the moments of joy and mirth you've experienced, to the countless smiles you've shared with loved ones. That scar on your knee? It's a reminder of a childhood adventure, a time when you threw caution to the wind and embraced life with fearless abandon. The blotches on your skin, simple signs of a life lived well, normal wear and tear, genetics --- humans look like that, it is our natural look. Those silver strands in your hair? They are a crown of wisdom, a sign of the knowledge and understanding you've gained through years of living and that is what Butterfly Path is all about --- living human experiences and growing wisdom and spiritual skills in the process.
Udbhu-kanti invites us to celebrate these marks of life, to wear them with pride as proof of our unique journey. It encourages us to shift our focus from surface-level appearance to the rich tapestry of experiences, emotions, and wisdom that make us who we are.
This perspective is especially poignant when we consider the fact of reincarnation. We have lived many lives before this one; our current physical form is but a temporary vessel for an old soul. The Wayist saying, "When you declare something Beautiful --- you have declared many other things Ugly," is apt here. We are in charge of what is beautiful to us, not they who control commerce and consumerist minds. We make our own definitions of what is beautiful --- and for udbhu-kanti minds, authenticity is the ultimate beauty. New things are beautiful, like a baby, when they are authentic. But a baby with a wig, factory eyelashes, cake makeup, and eyeliner --- that's funny.
We cherish character. Usefulness and friendliness also add to what makes things and people attractive.
The body we hold right now is so very temporary. We have lived in other bodies through lifetimes of magnificently rich experiences --- we have exhausted several other human bodies in lifetimes past --- were good at it. I asked an AI to 'draw a picture of two beautiful older women' --- even the machines know what real people look like --- and so should we.
When we look at ourselves through this lens, we start to see the incredible depth and beauty of our own being. We understand that the love and loyalty in soul which we share with others is not confined to this lifetime, but is a bond that endures across the ages. We see that the challenges we face and overcome are not just obstacles, but opportunities for growth and transformation. We stop blaming others, other groups, other people, the economy, and we stop seeking identity in passing fads --- we become authentic, real, and we deal with our issues as we have done all so many lifetimes before.
So how can we cultivate this perspective of self-acceptance and self-celebration? One way is through the practice of gratitude. Each day, take a moment to appreciate your body and all it has carried you through. Thank your feet for the miles they've walked, your hands for the love they've given and received, your liver for hanging in there during college, your skin for being there in all seasons and making the beach special, your toe-nails for being such a great help in times of need, your bladder for not being smaller, your heart for the courage and compassion it has shown, your soul-minds for trying to deal with their issues, and your spirit-minds for showing theWAY and making life more meaningful and significant, and your guardian deity for always being there to protect and guide when you reach out and listen.
Another way is through the practice of self-compassion. When you find yourself critical of your own "imperfections", pause and ask yourself --- would you be critical like that to a beloved friend? Would you judge or demean them for those things? If you *would* be that critical, give this book away and go read something that helps you be more super powerful and more instantly wealthy.
Or, do you see the "imperfections" of your friends as their unique signature, the quirks that make them real to you, the character you love? Extend to yourself the same understanding and acceptance, and read on because you are truly worthy of the words of life-changing wisdom to follow.
Finally, cultivate a sense of wonder and appreciation for your own unique journey. Reflect on the experiences, both joyful and challenging, that have shaped you. Celebrate the scars, the wrinkles, the imperfections as markers of a life fully lived, a soul deeply engaged in the rich tapestry of human experience.
When you make love, do you do it with your body or primarily your soul and heart, and where you allow your mind to go? That is where your specialness lies, that is what makes you sexually attractive, sexually desirable, and enjoyable --- not the body so much. When you walk into a room full of people, do you do it with your body and its attire, or with your brain-mind, soul-minds, and heart --- is your smile sure, disarming, warm and welcoming, true? That is the energy everyone who matters sense and feel --- not the body and its garnishing so much.
In embracing the udbhu-kanti within ourselves, we not only deepen our own sense of self-love and self-acceptance --- we also contribute to a wider culture of compassion, authenticity, and celebration of the human spirit in all its diverse and imperfect beauty. We become increasingly self-aware and more motivated to take care of our bodies, to put fewer toxins in, strive to use less "medicine", improve the quality of nutrition and shed the excesses.
So let us learn to see ourselves through the eyes of udbhu-kanti. Let us honor the heart and sense of self, the soul-minds that make us, and the wisdom that beautify us, the scars, cherish the wrinkles, and celebrate the beautifully complex, perfectly imperfect beings that we are. For it is in embracing our own authentic essence that we may just find the key to true joy, true peace, and true connection with soul and spirit --- in this lifetime and beyond.

## Udbhu-Kanti in Relationships
The beauty of udbhu-kanti shines perhaps most brilliantly in the realm of human connection. It is in our relationships --- with family, friends, lovers, nature, and even strangers --- that we have the opportunity to truly see and celebrate the imperfect, authentic beauty of character, of another soul.
In the early stages of a relationship, we often present a polished version of ourselves. We hide our quirks, smooth over our rough edges, and try to project an image of flawless charm. But as a relationship deepens, as we spend more time with another person, something magical starts to happen. We begin to see beneath the surface, to discover the real, raw, beautifully human person underneath. We must discover the real person if we intend a long-term relationship because that, is the person you will live with till the end of days, till when their body, like yours, be in need of a body shop and some spare parts.
If a date is stucco'd over with a lot of pretending to appear to be someone else, try to meet the real someone. If a date arrives in a fancy rental car, has a hair piece, has a fake platinum credit card, a wad of fake notes, and wears a mask of makeup. Obviously this person is "in character" for the role in their movie. You may want to meet the actor, not the character. You may like the authentic person better than the character.
This is where udbhu-kanti blooms. It's in the vulnerable moments, the imperfect moments, that true connection is forged. It's when we don't care to hide our scars, both physical and emotional, that we create space for genuine understanding and empathy. Our scars are the marks of the healing over, or wisdom-over, of past experiences. I'm not saying show your inability to deal with your emotional and mental stuff --- that's like dating with open wounds that won't heal.
It's when we reveal our quirks and the idiosyncrasies which we decided to make part of who we are, that we invite another to love us for who we truly are. If we don't have the maturity of character to deal with our emotions, we owe it to others to show that, let them know --- they may be looking for someone with open wounds to take to the emotional ER, or they may be looking for someone we are not. But never do we craft a shiny lure when dating; only when we are in shallow waters do we date like its fly-fishing or hunting for food.
Think of a long-term partnership, a love that has weathered the years. In the beginning, it may have been the shiny things that attracted you --- the perfect smile, the clever wit, the flawless facade. But as time goes on, as you navigate the joys and challenges of life together, something deeper emerges. You start to appreciate the way your partner's eyes crinkle and the involuntary snort when they laugh, even as those crinkles deepen into permanent lines. You cherish the way they accidentally burn the toast every morning, not in spite of this quirk, but because of it. You love them more for the scars, the stories shared, the authentic self they are with you. This is the person with whom, as the tornado descends upon you, you cling onto the same sheet of plywood, the sound of roaring winds drowning out all other noise, united in your quest to witness together the wonders that await on the other side.
This is the gift of udbhu-kanti in relationships --- the understanding that true love, true connection, is not about perfection but about genuine acceptance and appreciation of another's authentic being. It's sitting on the creaky porch in front on the creaky house you own, holding your loved one's creaky weathered hand, looking at the wrinkled skin you watched age over decades of doing things together, remembering with a heart-smile the 812 times you said, "put cream on your hands, wear gloves", and now you're watching the sunset paint the sky in magic hues just for the two of you to celebrate your deep love and respect for one another ... and then a floorboard splinter reminds you of its enduring presence in your life, also looking for some attention.
The same principle applies to all our relationships. With friends, it's not the polished Instagram-ready moments that create the deep bonds, but the raw, real, sometimes messy moments of mistakes and mishaps and the crazy, how you fixed it and how you made good with everyone. Its not the hours of talk, disrespecting and trashing your partner and refusing to deal with normal human emotions, always just venting. The type of person who disrespects a partner or speaks ill to an outsider of the partner is not ready for the depth of character that udbhu-kanti requires.
With family, it's in accepting and even cherishing each other's unique quirks and imperfections that we build unbreakable ties. Their unbearably obstinate quirks, that's what makes them, and we have them with us. Cancel culture is the exact opposite of udbhu-kanti, it holds to moving definitions of perfection which it enforces by violence, but udbhu-kanti seeks to reach the authentic and allow people their own character, opinions, minds, and soul --- but that demands soul maturity. Even with strangers, a moment of authentic connection --- a shared smile, a helping hand --- can create a spark of udbhu-kanti, a recognition of our shared humanity, community, in all its imperfect beauty.
In a world that often promotes a superficial and curated version of connection, embracing udbhu-kanti in our relationships is a radical act, an art of living. It means daring to be real, to be vulnerable, to show up as our authentic selves. It means extending to others the same grace and acceptance we strive to give ourselves.
So how can we cultivate more udbhu-kanti in our relationships? One way is through the practice of deep listening. When someone you care for, who is not simply spewing venom or always venting, shares their story, their scars, their imperfections, resist the urge to judge or fix. Instead, offer your full presence and open-hearted acceptance of *their* reality. Create a safe space for authentic expression.
Another way is through the practice of what people nowadays refer to as vulnerability. It's simply to not hide the real you, even (and especially) the parts you used to hide. In this brave act of self-revelation, you invite others to do the same and you run the risk of not being liked. That is what you want. If you know beforehand the other person finds the real you unlikable, you have saved yourself, your future children, and the would-be partner, a decade of hell on earth before the inevitable divorce. And people change. They build character on their foundations and change over time. So do show your foundations and seek to see it in others. Authenticity early on is the best investment a couple can make in life. It saves so much hardship. If you make the wrong choices, you rob yourself of a life of loving-kindness, care, and mutual joy with the right person who likes and loves you for your real and authentic self.
Finally, actively look for and celebrate the udbhu-kanti in others. Tell your partner how much you adore their dance moves and quirks. Thank your friend for always being there, even in their own imperfect way. Smile at a stranger's unique style, appreciating the courage it takes to be different, and take courage from it. Wear something unique, listen and read something that speaks to your authentic self. Be deeply afraid for your true self when you find you are following in the ways of a group of people you don't really care for. Change, it's easy to do if you follow the Wayist ways. Udbhu-kanti requires self-knowledge, self-craft, and courage --- it gets easier and very rewarding over time.
Can we put this in one sentence? Let's try. "Stop caring what others think --- the right others will think like you and gravitate toward you"
In cultivating udbhu-kanti in our relationships, we create a world of deeper connection, greater compassion, and more authentic love. We build bonds based not on superficial perfection, but on the rich, textured, perfectly imperfect reality of what it means to be human.
So let us bring the spirit of udbhu-kanti into every interaction, every connection. Let us dare to love and be loved for our authentic selves. For it is in the sacred space of genuine acceptance and appreciation that the most beautiful relationships bloom --- and the truest beauty of the human spirit shines through.

## The Art of \"Imperfect\" Living
Life, in all its messy, unpredictable, perfectly imperfect glory, is not a problem to be solved but an adventure to be lived. It's a grand tapestry woven from countless moments, each one adding its own unique thread to the overall masterpiece. And it is through the lens of udbhu-kanti that we learn to appreciate the beauty in every stitch, even (and especially) the ones that seem to go awry.
Imagine, for a moment, a hand-knitted sweater. It's a labor of love, crafted over many hours with care and attention. But look closer and you'll see that it's not perfect. There might be a dropped stitch here, a slightly uneven row there, a broken thread now tied with a knot. To the untrained eye, these might seem like flaws. But to the wearer, they are what make the sweater unique, a one-of-a-kind creation that carries the essence of its maker.
Now imagine that sweater is your life. Every experience, every joyful moment, and painful lesson, every triumph, and every misadventure, is a stitch in your grand design. Some stitches might be neat and tidy, the result of careful planning and execution. But others might be a bit more haphazard, the result of spontaneous choices or unexpected detours.
If you know you want the udbhu-kanti of life, stop comparing yourself and your life, and most of all, your partner, to the images of "perfection" or the unattainable ideals put out there by the unhappy, unfulfilled, identity-seeking people that create content to fill your mind with their templates of "perfection". The Wayist saying goes, "Own your own mind, because if you don't, someone else will". Start with udhu-kanti in your own mind, then work from there.
The beauty of udbhu-kanti is that it invites us to cherish all these stitches of the sweater equally. It reminds us that it's the imperfections, the unique twists and turns, that make our lives rich and interesting. A life lived perfectly according to plan might make for a neat sweater, but it's the dropped stitches and uneven rows, the running out of the same batch of wool and making a compromise, that make it a true original. While shallow-others may be fixated on the one dropped stitch of our sweater, you wear it and live the heck out of it --- let them worry about it if that floats their boat.
This idea is liberating. It means we don't have to strive for some impossible ideal of perfection. We can embrace the quirks, the mistakes, the detours as part of the grand adventure. We can approach life with a sense of curiosity and wonder, eager to see what unique pattern emerges.
Our life may not be the same as others, hopefully it's not the same as the cookie-cutter "perfection" the popular narrative wants for your mind and soul. We measure what people call "success" not be their yardstick but by our lived experience of being human and all that one can pack into a lifetime.
Of course, this doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to learn and grow and improve. But it does mean that we can do so with a spirit of self-compassion and acceptance. We can look at our missteps not as failures but as fascinating plot twists in our one-of-a-kind story, and seek to live more deeply and more authentically.
To want a different kind of success, is the first success on theWAY and its Butterfly Path --- and that takes courage. The courage to live well.
So how can we bring more of this udbhu-kanti spirit into our daily lives? One way is to cultivate a sense of playfulness, joy of life, and experimentation. Try that new hobby you've been curious about, even if you might be 'bad' at it. Take a different route to work, just to see what you discover. Embrace the role of adventurer in your own life. In the bedroom, have the courage to go where toffy-nosed boiler-plate people don't go. In dealing with mistakes and mishaps, seek a real solution and don't allow the unhappy, unfulfilled, heavily medicated, or politically paid-for people to tell you how to do it.
Imagine being so wealthy and healthy in your 30's: you own your home outright, you have zero debt, your family business makes good enough to employ your aging parents, you have a TV and a family scooter, more than enough food for all, your kids are well mannered and friendly and helpful, and the future looks rosy. This is how most people in the world live. It is the reason why they don't have all the mental health and other problems associated with the unhappy West.
Another way to embrace this philosophy of life is to practice reframing. When something doesn't go according to plan, instead of berating yourself, get curious. What can you learn from this experience? How might this unexpected detour enrich your story in ways you can't yet imagine?
Ultimately, living with udbhu-kanti is about embracing the rich texture of life in all its forms. It's about finding the beauty in the imperfect, the magic in the mundane, the extraordinary in the everyday. It's about weaving a life that is uniquely, wonderfully, perfectly yours.
So, as you go about your days, remember your sweater. Remember that every stitch, no matter how neat or messy, is a crucial part of your grand design. Embrace the adventure of imperfect living, and watch as your life unfolds in the most beautifully unexpected ways.
For it is in the dropping of stitches, the uneven rows, the unique patterns that emerge, that we find the true artistry of a life well-lived. And it is through the lens of udbhu-kanti that we learn to cherish this artistry in ourselves, in others, and in the glorious, imperfect tapestry of life itself.

## The Wisdom of Impermanence
In the fleeting dance of cherry blossoms in the spring breeze, in the shifting patterns of sand dunes under the desert sun, how the beach is made anew every day, in the ever-changing canvas of a sunset sky and how the weather entertains us with what will it be like today and tomorrow --- the wisdom of impermanence is all around us. It is through the lens of udbhu-kanti that we learn to find beauty and peace in this constant flow of change. After all, we have been coming to human bodies for ages and every time a different ethnicity, gender, social class, and physical look --- we need change to succeed in the spiritual quest.
The principles of udbhu-kanti, after all, are deeply rooted in an acceptance of impermanence. When we cherish the worn and weathered, the chipped and faded, we are, in a sense, honoring the passage of time. We are acknowledging that all things, including ourselves, are subject to the universal law of change.
This can be a difficult truth to accept. We often cling to the illusion of permanence, wanting things (and people, and moments) to stay just as they are. We might resist the changes in our bodies as we age, or feel a sense of loss as our children grow up and leave the nest. We become very aware of how we don't bend over all the way to pick up the hammer, but we step on the one end to make it stand up, then we pick it up. We might try to hold on to a perfect memory, not wanting the moment to end.
But udbhu-kanti invites us to find peace and even joy in the impermanence of life. It reminds us that change is not a threat, but a natural and necessary part of the human experience. Just as the cherry blossom or orchid is beautiful because of its fleeting bloom, so too can we find beauty in the passing seasons of our own lives. We know we will die and not too long from now. Like the cherry-blossom, we must embrace every moment and seek what joy, fun, and quirk we can get from it. Life is hilarious when you analyze it, especially yours.
This doesn't mean we can't cherish the past or hope for the future. But it does mean learning to live more fully in the present, to appreciate each moment for what it is, knowing that it will never come again. It means learning to let go gracefully when the time comes, trusting in the cyclical nature of life.
In practical terms, embracing impermanence might mean savoring your morning coffee (without synthetic additives), fully engaging your senses in the experience, instead of gulping it down while scrolling through your phone. It might mean taking a mental snapshot of a child's laughter, committing the sound to your heart's memory. It might mean taking a deep breath and finding acceptance in times of change, knowing that 'this too shall pass' and life is full of changes --- let them be.
Life is a river that flows in undercurrents and chaos; even if the surface looks predictable, it's not. We cannot step into the same river twice. Each moment we have, will never again be. Next time, if it comes, will be different. Cherish the moment, be mindful and anchor it in your soul-minds, for even the brain mind will soon sick and perish along with its knowledge and memories --- live deeply so the soul minds carry the impressions to the hereafter life.
Cultivating udbhu-kanti in the face of impermanence also means learning to find beauty in all stages of life's journey. Just as we cherish the worn and weathered objects for the stories they hold, we can learn to appreciate the beauty in every season of our own lives. We can honor the wisdom of our aging bodies, the depth of character that comes from weathering life's storms. We can find joy in the present moment, especially when we acknowledge its fleeting nature.
In some ways, the wisdom of impermanence is the ultimate lesson of udbhu-kanti. It teaches us to let go of superficial perfection and instead find beauty in the authentic, the real, the lasting, the raw stuff of life. It invites us to dance with the changing rhythms of existence, to find grace in the letting go.
And so, as you move through your days, try to keep the wisdom of impermanence close to your heart. Savor the good moments, knowing they are precious precisely because they are fleeting. Find courage in times of change, trusting in the natural ebb and flow of life. And always, always, look for the beauty in the present moment, in all its imperfect, ever-changing glory.
For it is in embracing impermanence that we truly learn to live. And it is through the lens of udbhu-kanti that we find the grace, the wisdom, and the abiding beauty in this grand adventure of constant change.

## The Udbhu-Kanti of Knowing Your \'Enough\'
In the hustle and bustle of boilerplate modern life, it's easy to get caught up in the chase for more of what others say is right for us. More money, more possessions, more status, more identity, more of other people's taxes, more justice for my cause, more, more, more. We're bombarded with messages telling us that happiness lies just around the corner, if only we could get that promotion, buy that car, get more credit, take that vacation, win that lotto --- millionaires are just lucky, employers and landlords are crooks. But the wisdom of udbhu-kanti invites us to pause, to take a breath, and to consider a different path --- the path of "knowing your enough".
This reminds me of a well-known story, a parable of sorts, about a Mexican fisherman and a wealthy businessman from the city on vacation in a coastal village. The businessman was horrified to find the fisherman lounging on the beach beside his small boat, his kids playing in the sand, his wife cleaning fish to dry and sell. "Why aren't you out fishing? The weather is perfect?" he asked. The fisherman replied, "I've caught enough fish for today."
The businessman then launched into a lecture. "But if you went out twice a day, you could bring in twice as much fish! And then you could buy a bigger boat. In a few years of hard work and good planning you'd have a whole fleet of fishing boats!"
"And then what?" asked the fisherman.
"Well, then you'd be rich!" exclaimed the businessman. "You could retire, move to a small coastal village, sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings where you could play guitar with your amigos, like I do."
The fisherman looked puzzled. "But señor, isn't that what I'm doing now?"
This simple story captures the essence of knowing your 'enough'. It's about recognizing when you have what you need, and finding contentment in that. It's about defining success on your own terms, not society's. And it's about understanding that true wealth lies not in accumulation, but in appreciation.
The philosophy of udbhu-kanti is deeply intertwined with this idea. When we learn to find beauty in the simple, the authentic, the imperfect, we free ourselves from the endless cycle of wanting more. We start to appreciate the wealth that already surrounds us --- the love of our family, the warmth of the sun on our face, the simple pleasure of a home-cooked meal. The fisherman in our parable has no need for a flashy new boat, his old weather-beaten boat is just fine and maybe one day on its birthday he will give it a fresh coat of paint. He has no need for a "better" transport, his old clunker is good transport. He has no need for a "better wife" he has the best there is. He has no need for an AC in the house, they have fans. He has no need ... And that's his udbhu-kanti --- he knows his enough and he lives it, and they all have a high-quality life, family time, fresh air, leisure time, fun, sun-baked sex, and whatever else they need.
It's about knowing your true needs --- not the needs "they" tell you to need.
This doesn't mean we shouldn't have goals or ambitions. But it does mean ensuring that these goals are aligned with our true values, not just a response to external pressures. It means being honest with ourselves about what really matters, and having the courage to let go of the rest. Courage, yes, because others who worship at the other altar will look upon you as an apostate from their religion and treat you different.
In practical terms, living with an udbhu-kanti mindset of 'enough' might mean downsizing your cost of living to what you truly need, rather than what you're told you should need. It might mean opting for experiences over possessions, investing in memories rather than things. It might mean learning to find joy in the everyday, make the most of the moment, rather than always chasing the next big thrill or someone else's idea of success.
Cultivating a sense of 'enough' also means practicing gratitude. When we take the time to appreciate what we have, we realize how rich we truly are. We start to see the abundance in our lives, rather than focusing on what we lack. This shift in perspective can be truly transformative.
Of course, knowing your 'enough' isn't always easy. It requires a certain level of self-awareness, a willingness to listen to your true authentic self, your ancient soul, listen to your heart over the noise of the crowd. It means being okay with swimming against the tide of consumerism and materialism, and being fleetingly popular in the crowd. But the rewards --- the peace, the contentment, the true wealth --- are more than worth it.
Let your soul help you know your Enough. Tell it to think back. Your Enough is what you need to live during a time of war or economic collapse. Its not hard to remember what it's like.
Let the soul think back what it was like in past lives, when Arabs captured and traded millions of slaves all over the world, what about when you lived during Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, the British Empire and Spanish wilfully starved millions upon millions of people to death, and worked them till their demise, dispossessed millions of their livelihoods, land, and opportunities. What was it like for the Cambodians and Russians, like the Dutch having lost all the food they produced on the land, not even allowed to keep even enough to feed a baby? Remember when the Belgians maimed children for not producing enough? When the 1930's rolled in and the evil forces at play collapsed the markets, they grabbed millions of farms and confiscated private assets and closed factories, banks foreclosed on homes and farms.
Times come and go, and cycles repeat. There are always forces who engineer social collapses and misery. In times like those, they who need less are most likely to have the better quality of life both in crises and in prosperity. They who need less are the wealthiest among people, and the most content. In the present time, they who need the least are the wealthy among us. Ask your soul; what is your level of having enough?
Theoretically, your Enough are non-negotiables like sufficient nutrition, sunshine, light, heating in winter and maintaining your shelter. Then there are the nice to haves which you enjoy because we're not living in a national crisis, things like soap, rubbing alcohol for smelly armpits, coffee, and access to online books so you can read the rest of this book.
To Find your Enough, means being content and satisfied to get by on the essentials. Then, you have the freedom to choose when, where, and how you want to explore and enjoy something else. Then, you can do what you do with joy, gusto, and self-respect. You always have cash in reserves.
This is what the word udbhu means for us. For example, we are content (happy, in fact!) with a small place, simple food, and modest transport. And when we decide to prioritize a "luxury", we have total enjoyment because we engage it full.
What happens should you lose your job next year due to a terminal illness, leaving your future uncertain as you navigate the unknown timeline of your life expectancy? Have you lived enough? Can you live with less? Will you flow into Paradise feeling content? Will you be happy, was your life meaningful, well spent and interesting enough?
Some people say there are no affordable udbhu-kanti homes in their city because those are only in slums. These are the choices we all make in life. If you choose to live in a particular place, you choose that economic standard. If you cannot live your udbhu-kanti there, to save your soul you would want to make some hard decisions to go udbhu-kanti adventure elsewhere.
Can your Enough be provided with one income, or no income? Can you get by because you have money set aside for a crisis? Many with an udbu-kanti mindset are millionaires and spend about \$10,000 every five or more years to replace their vehicle. They don't carry debt and don't desire things they don't need. They bought starter homes and upgraded with cash money, mostly doing the work themselves. From a western mind-view, looking at their home, vehicle, and how they dress, where they hang out, and who their friends are --- you would never guess their wealth. It's a mindset and worldview of deeper appreciation for what you have, and making full use of all that you do have.
How much cash you have left over in savings after you have enjoyed your Enough, directly affects your quality of life, material, and mental wellness.
But the main question is this. What will be your mindset if suddenly your income is halved? Are your emotional and comfort needs of Enough so that you will be okay? Do you cook, or do you live like the 1% wealthiest people in the world who have prepared food delivered, or eat out like the rich? Do you buy ready-made coffee at 20x the price of homemade coffee? Do you absolutely need all the devices, memberships and the streaming accounts and subscriptions in your Enough?
On a retreat, an American attendee summed it up in their language. Saying, "I get it. A real loser is they who have stuff to show off, which they cannot afford in cash, so they lease, mortgage and buy on credit. True winners are they who don't need the external validation and pay for things out of their savings."
So, as you navigate your own path, take a moment to pause and reflect. What does 'enough' look like for you? What truly matters in the grand scheme of your life? And how can you start to align your choices, your actions, your very way of being with this deeper understanding? Can you get a partner to walk this path with you? Do you want to raise your children in the udbhu-kanti way?
Remember, true wealth isn't measured in dollars or possessions. It's measured in quality of life, wholesomeness, moments of laughter, in acts of kindness, in the warmth of a loved one's embrace. It's measured in the simple, authentic, perfectly imperfect stuff of life. And it's through the wisdom of udbhu-kanti, through the art of knowing your 'enough', that you'll find the truest riches of all.

## Udbhu-Kanti and the Joy of Simplicity
In a world that often equates complexity with value, udbhu-kanti invites us to rediscover the profound joy of simplicity. It reminds us that the most meaningful things in life are often the most basic, the most elemental, the most authentic. And it encourages us to find beauty and contentment in the simple pleasures that are all around us, if only we take the time to notice.
Think, for a moment, about the simple joy of a warm cup of tea on a cold day. There's nothing particularly fancy or elaborate about it --- just water, leaves, and heat. But in that simplicity lies a profound comfort, a moment of pure presence and enjoyment. The steam rising from the cup, the warmth seeping into your hands, the subtle flavors unfolding on your tongue --- it's a sensory experience that grounds you in the here and now. The making of it become a quiet-time ritual, a respect, a soul-moment.
This is the essence of udbhu-kanti --- finding deep satisfaction in the simple, the authentic, the unadorned. It's about appreciating the inherent beauty in things as they are, with no embellishment or excess.
Like the honesty and simple authenticity of spices --- almost divine, the beauty of their energies --- should we not hold that definition of ultimate beauty as the higher standard?
*If you had never seen star anise this big, and you are fighting off an impulse to get your senses involved in such a wonder --- it's because you don\'t use the same AI graphic generator.*
Like a real watermelon unadorned with the accoutrements and garnish of agricultural chemicals and mRNA, with seeds, its a simple thing. You eat it raw, straight-up, just as is. Simple. Yet, your soul comes out to thank you for sharing the experience, its like tasting sunshine and sunset at the same time, an experience that feeds the soul and the body.
Like a fellow from the Caribbean expounded on a TikTok the taste of a real mango: "...its like tasting a sunset, its like tasting the knowing that you are loved." A simple thing, yet so deeply profound and wisdom-making.
A steak, medium-rare with salt and a dash of pepper, is udbhu-kanti. The verb to "eat it" does not do justice. It is a quiet-time meditative experience of mindfulness and gratitude. It is soul food and nutrition for the body.
In our daily lives, embracing simplicity might mean decluttering our spaces, keeping only those things that truly serve us or bring us joy. It might mean opting for a homemade meal with friends over a restaurant dinner, recognizing that it's the laughter and conversation that nourish us more than the food. It might mean choosing a quiet walk or picnic in nature over a flashy entertainment experience, understanding that it's in the stillness we often find the greatest quality of life experience.
Simplicity, in udbhu-kanti, isn't about deprivation or lack. It's about stripping away the inessential to reveal the beauty that lies beneath. It's about recognizing that we need little to be happy, and that true contentment comes from within.
Udbhu-kanti is about having more, much more meaning and beauty, joy, and fulfilment from the simple things that make the very fiber of life.
The idea of udbhu-kanti is beautifully encapsulated in the Zen concept of "wabi-sabi" and its kintsugi style of purposely showing the repair marks of a broken item, to honour its history --- which shares much with the philosophy of udbhu-kanti. Wabi-sabi, like udbhu-kanti, celebrates the beauty of the imperfect, the impermanent, and the incomplete. It finds profound meaning in the cracks and crevices of life, recognizing that it's in these spaces that authenticity and character reside.
Applying these principles to our lives, we might start to see the beauty in a chipped mug, a scar, or blemish, cherishing it for the memories it holds rather than discarding it for its imperfections. We might learn to appreciate the simple beauty of a wildflower, marveling at its resilience and grace rather than comparing it to a cultivated prize-winning rose variety from a synthetic environment. We might find joy in the unstructured play of children, recognizing the creativity and freedom that emerges in the absence of complicated toys or structured activities, or the mind-arresting hypnotism of mobile devices.
Living with simplicity also means learning to let go of the need for control, embracing the natural flow of life. It means being open to serendipity, to the unexpected joys that arise when we're not trying to orchestrate every moment. It means trusting that, in the grand tapestry of life, every thread has its place, even if we can't see the full pattern yet.
Of course, embracing simplicity isn't always easy in a world that often celebrates complexity and excess. It requires a shift in perspective, a willingness to let go of the narratives we've been told what exactly we need to be happy. But the rewards --- the quality of life, the peace, the presence, the profound appreciation for life's simple gifts --- are more than worth the effort.
So as you move through your days, take a moment to pause and appreciate the simple pleasures that surround you. Get rid of excess. Savor that first sip of coffee in the morning with your whole soul. Really, but really, look at the smile on a child's face. Take a deep breath of fresh air and feel the sun on your skin. We have been living with the sun, and needing the sun on our skin, for as long as humankind existed. We need it for much more than you might think --- drink it up, but like good wine and food, don't overindulge.
Remember, it's in these simple moments that the true beauty of life reveals itself. And it's through the wisdom of udbhu-kanti, through the joy of simplicity, that we can learn to live in harmony with this beauty, every day.

## Udbhu-Kanti and the Art of Letting Go
In the gentle fall of autumn leaves, in the fading light of a sunset sky, in the fleeting beauty of a dandelion's wispy seeds carried on the breeze, nature is constantly teaching us the art of letting go. And it is through the lens of udbhu-kanti that we learn to apply this wisdom to our own lives, finding peace and freedom in the practice of non-attachment.
At its core, udbhu-kanti is about cherishing the present moment, appreciating the beauty that is right in front of us. But implicit in this appreciation is the understanding that all things are temporary, that change is the only constant. The autumn leaf is beautiful precisely because it is fleeting, because it dances in the wind for a brief moment before returning to the earth to contribute to the energy ecology of the Cycle of Creation.
Applying this principle to our lives, we might start to loosen our grip on the things we cannot control. We might learn to appreciate the people and experiences that grace our lives, without clinging to them or trying to make them permanent. We might come to understand that true love means holding something lightly, with an open hand, be forgiving and compromise, rather than grasping tightly with a clenched fist.
This isn't to say that we shouldn't care deeply, that we shouldn't invest ourselves fully in the people and pursuits that matter to us. But it means recognizing the difference between healthy engagement and unhealthy attachment. It means being present and committed, while also being willing to adapt and let go when the time comes. It means to retreat and heal, regroup and proceed with wisdom.
In practical terms, the art of letting go might involve decluttering not just our physical spaces, but our mental and emotional ones as well. It might mean practicing forgiveness, releasing old grudges and resentments that weigh us down. It might mean learning to reframe 'failure' as an opportunity for growth and learning, rather than a permanent indictment of our worth.
Letting go also means being open to change, even when it's uncomfortable. It means recognizing that growth often involves shedding old skin, letting go of what no longer serves us to make space for what does. It means trusting in the cyclical nature of life, knowing that every ending is also a new beginning.
This idea is beautifully captured in the concept of 'aparigraha', one of the key principles of yoga philosophy. Aparigraha encourages non-possessiveness, the practice of letting go of our attachments to material things, to relationships, even to outcomes. It recognizes that true freedom comes from within, from a place of inner contentment that isn't dependent on external circumstances.
Cultivating the art of letting go doesn't mean we become detached or uncaring. Rather, it means we learn to care deeply from a place of inner stability, to love fully without losing ourselves. It means we find security in our own sense of self, rather than in the things we cling to.
Letting go of cultural conditioned thinking is important. Not all of the old ways were good, we have grown and want a new goodness. Not all of the new ways of thinking are good, we want a new goodness. In fact, we don't want what *they* want, we want what we want. We want to own our own minds, to learn from their and our mistakes and bad ideas of the past, and move toward the light --- even if we must walk alone for now.
Of course, letting go is a practice, a skill that we cultivate over time. It requires patience, self-compassion, and a willingness to sit with discomfort. But the more we practice, the more we start to experience the peace and freedom that comes from holding life's experiences lightly. And with a change in mindset, often, comes a change in landscape. Some people will find your new self unattractive and move on, and others will find your new self attractive and move closer. The law of attraction may mean many things for different people, but in the energy awareness teaching of theWAY, it means people of a similar energy are attracted to one another, and people of a similar mindset will soon share a similar karmic learning opportunity.
So as you navigate the twists and turns of your own journey, remember the wisdom of the falling leaf, the fading sunset, the dandelion seed on the breeze, the caterpillar molting and changing to a butterfly. Practice appreciating the beauty of each moment, while also allowing it to pass gracefully. Learn to hold your plans, loved ones, and desires lightly, trusting that life will unfold as it should.
And always, always, remember that your true essence, your deepest self, is beyond the temporary fluctuations of material gain and loss. It is in this space of inner wholeness that you'll find the strength and the grace to let go, again and again and again.
For it is in letting go that we truly learn to live. And it is through the wisdom of udbhu-kanti, through the art of non-attachment, that we find the freedom to dance with life's ever-changing rhythms, in all their perfectly imperfect beauty.

## Udbhu-Kanti and the Beauty of Authenticity
In a world that often prizes conformity and perfection, udbhu-kanti invites us to celebrate the beauty of authenticity. It encourages us to embrace our unique quirks, our imperfections, our rough edges --- all the things that make us real, human, and entirely ourselves.
The same is true for us as individuals. Our scars, our wrinkles, our idiosyncrasies --- these are not flaws to be hidden or erased. They are the marks of a life well-lived, a story uniquely our own. They are what make us interesting, relatable, and real --- and someone we are happy to live with.
In the context of udbhu-kanti, authenticity isn't about being perfect. It's about being true to yourself, even (and especially) when that means diverging from the norm. It's about having the courage to be vulnerable, to show up as you are, without pretense or facade.
This kind of authenticity can be challenging. It means risking rejection, disapproval, maybe even ridicule. But it is also immensely freeing. When we stop trying to fit into someone else's mold, when we stop caring more to be liked than being ourself, when we stop comparing ourselves to their standards of "perfection" and "winning", when we start living from a place of inner truth, we tap into a deep well of peace and power.
Be prepared. People are afraid of, or unsettled by, people who don't care whether they are liked by their crowd. They don't deal well with people who don't need what they need.
In practical terms, living authentically might mean living your truth, even when your knees shake. It might mean pursuing a career or hobby that lights you up, even if it's not the most 'practical' choice. It might mean setting boundaries, saying no to things that don't align with your values or priorities.
Authenticity also means embracing your own unique journey, without comparing it to anyone else's. It means understanding that your path is one that has been coming many lifetimes. The path is your own, complete with its own timing, its own challenges, and its own triumphs. It means celebrating your progress, even if it looks different from what society tells you it should. We did not come here as entertainers, to play a scripted character in their movie, we came here to live our Path because we are aiming at the big prize, to develop the soul and become an immortal spiritual being. Their game, their culture, their value systems, and their obsessions belong to them. We have a Path and a soul-duty to love.
One of the powerful examples of authenticity in action is the life of Frida Kahlo, the renowned Mexican artist. Frida's life was marked by physical and emotional pain, but she never shied away from expressing this in her art. She painted her reality, her truth, in all its raw and imperfect beauty. Her self-portraits, with their unflinching honesty and vivid imagery, are a testament to the power of authenticity.
Frida once said, "I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best." This is the essence of authenticity --- having the courage to know yourself, to be with yourself, and to express yourself, even in the face of loneliness or adversity.
Of course, living authentically doesn't mean we never change or grow. In fact, it is often through being true to ourselves that we create the space for real transformation. But this growth comes from a place of self-honesty and self-acceptance, not from a desire to fit someone else's expectations.
So, as you navigate your own path, take a moment to reflect on what authenticity means to you. Where in your life are you being called to be more true to yourself? What parts of your story, your truth, are you ready to embrace and express?
Remember, your authenticity is your gift to the world. It is the unique flavor that only you can bring to the grand banquet of life. This bouquet is exquisite in its beauty, precisely because the flowers are different, unique. And it is through the lens of udbhu-kanti, through the celebration of authenticity in all its imperfect beauty, that we learn to savor this gift, in ourselves and in each other.
For it is in being true to ourselves that we find the truest form of beauty. And it is in embracing authenticity that we tap into the rich, raw, perfectly imperfect essence of what it means to be alive.

## Living Udbhu-Kanti
### \~ Cultivating a Way of Being
As we've journeyed through the various facets of udbhu-kanti, from appreciating the beauty in imperfection to embracing the wisdom of impermanence, a central theme has emerged: udbhu-kanti is not just a philosophy, but a way of being. It is a daily practice, a continuous choice to see the world through the lens of authenticity, simplicity, and appreciation.
In many ways, living udbhu-kanti is like tending a garden. It requires patience, presence, and a willingness to get our hands dirty. We must be attentive to the needs of the moment, responsive to the unique conditions of our own lives. We must be willing to prune away what no longer serves us, to nourish what brings us joy and meaning.
One of the key practices of living udbhu-kanti is cultivating mindfulness. This means being fully present in each moment, engaging all our senses in the richness of immediate experience. It means savoring the warmth of the sun on our skin, the sound of laughter ringing in our ears, the taste of a ripe peach on our tongue. It means being awake to the extraordinary beauty that lies hidden in the ordinary.
Mindfulness also means bringing a gentle, non-judgmental awareness to our inner world --- our thoughts, feelings, and reactions. It means observing these with curiosity and compassion, rather than getting caught up in them or trying to push them away. In this space of awareness, we create room for choice, for responding rather than reacting.
Another essential practice of udbhu-kanti is gratitude. When we make a habit of noticing and appreciating the good in our lives, we shift our focus from what's missing to what's present. We start to see the abundance that surrounds us, even in the midst of challenge or lack. Gratitude is like water to the garden of our well-being --- it nourishes and sustains us.
Living udbhu-kanti also means embracing simplicity. This doesn't necessarily mean living with less, but rather making sure that what we do have aligns with our values and brings us genuine joy. It means decluttering not just our physical spaces but our schedules, our relationships, our minds. It means making room for what really matters, and letting go of the rest.
This form of simple living, some may call minimalism, and it may be to some extent. But udbhu-kanti is more about having more than about having less. We want more, lots more, meaning, joy, purpose, pleasure, and wisdom from human experiences and from the things and people in our life. We want more experiences and deeper connections to those experiences. Our lives are so full of all the meaning and connections, we want less stuff to connect with and have more meaningful relations with that which we choose to keep close.
Simplicity also means appreciating the beauty in the small, the quiet, the unassuming. It means finding as much joy in a simple home-cooked meal as in an extravagant feast, as much beauty in a dandelion as in a rose. A clean space with few things, but each special to us whose character we love having around. It means recognizing that the most meaningful things in life are often the most basic, the most fundamental.
Of course, living udbhu-kanti is not about achieving some state of perfection. It's a messy, imperfect, beautifully human endeavor. There will be days when we forget to be mindful, when we lose sight of gratitude, when we cling to what we know we need to let go. But these moments, too, are part of the practice. They are opportunities for self-compassion, for starting again, for remembering that growth is a journey, not a destination.
Ultimately, living udbhu-kanti is about aligning our outer lives with our inner truth. It's about creating a life that feels authentic and meaningful, regardless of how it might look from the outside. It's about learning to trust our own inner wisdom, to follow the voice of our heart, even when it leads us down unconventional paths.
As you embark on your own udbhu-kanti journey, remember to be patient with yourself. This is a practice, not a perfection. It's about progress, not about getting it "right". Trust that every moment, every experience, is an opportunity to deepen your understanding, to expand your appreciation, to grow in your ability to live with authenticity and grace.
And always, always remember that you are not alone on this path. In choosing to live udbhu-kanti, you join a community of souls across time and space who have recognized the extraordinary beauty in the ordinary, the profound wisdom in the simple, the true wealth in appreciating what is.
So take a deep breath, let it out slowly, and take your next step. The garden of your life is waiting, ready to bloom in its own perfectly imperfect way. And with each mindful step, each grateful breath, each choice toward simplicity and authenticity, you cultivate the rich soil of a life well-lived --- a life of udbhu-kanti.

## Udbhu-Kanti and the Tapestry of Connection
As we deepen into the practice of living udbhu-kanti, we begin to realize that this way of being is not just about our individual journey, but about our profound interconnectedness with all of life. Just as every unique thread is essential to the overall beauty of a tapestry, so too is each of our stories, our experiences, our authentic expressions a vital part of the grand weaving of existence.
This understanding of interconnectedness is at the heart of many ancient wisdom traditions. In Hinduism, it's encapsulated in the concept of "Indra's net" --- the idea that all beings and phenomena are intimately connected, like jewels in a vast net, each one reflecting all the others. In Wayism, it's expressed in the Sanskrit greeting "Namaste", which acknowledges the divine light and spiritual potential in each person, the shared essence that underlies our apparent separateness.
Udbhu-kanti invites us to experience this truth not just as an abstract concept, but as a lived reality. When we learn to see with the eyes of authenticity and appreciation, we start to recognize the threads that connect us --- the shared joys and sorrows, the common hopes and fears, the onslaught to program our minds to serve the needs of politicians and corporations, the universal longing for love and belonging.
We start to see that the old woman sitting on the park bench has a story as rich and complex as our own, she may not know how to work a smart phone which was invented when her grandchildren were ten years old, but she knows life inside out on levels of hardship and joy you have not yet seen. We don't know the depth of the other person's soul. Notwithstanding their level of education and social context, each soul comes with a deep history, often more wise and advanced, closer to graduation from the school of divinity for souls than ourselves. We start to see how it is that people who "failed" in the system of competition and power-seeking, did not fail in real life but may indeed be miles ahead in soul development compared to those who are "winning" in the game of competition, hoarding of resources, and power-seeking. We start to see that the child playing in the sandbox is grappling with the same big questions which keep us up at night, that the homeless person on the street corner is a reflection of our own vulnerability and resilience.
In practical terms, living from this place of interconnectedness might mean making eye contact and sharing a smile with a stranger, recognizing in that fleeting moment a deep human connection. It might mean listening to someone's story with an open heart, without judgment or agenda, honoring their unique experience as part of the larger tapestry. It might mean offering a helping hand or a kind word, trusting that each small act of compassion sends ripples out into the world.
Living udbhu-kanti also means recognizing our interconnectedness with the non-human world --- with the souls of animals, plants, and landscapes that sustain and inspire us. It means worrying about the chemical cocktails they feed plants on farms, and how that can be cruel to they who live in the soil, the plants themselves, and they who rely on it for nutrition. It means seeing nature not as a resource to be exploited, but as a teacher, a mirror, a partner in the dance of life. It means treating every encounter as sacred, whether it's with a majestic mountain or a humble blade of grass.
This sense of interconnectedness is beautifully expressed in the poetry of Mary Oliver, who wrote, "Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, the world offers itself to your imagination, calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting --- over and over announcing your place in the family of things."
When we live from this place of belonging, of deep connection to all of life, we naturally start to live with more compassion, more reverence, more care. We understand that our actions, our choices, our very way of being has an impact that ripples out far beyond what we can see. We start to live not just for ourselves, but for the well-being of the whole.
Of course, living with this awareness is not always easy. In a world that often promotes the illusion of separateness, of self-interest above all else, choosing to live from interconnectedness can feel like swimming against the tide. But the more we practice, the more we start to see that this is the true nature of reality --- that we are all in this together, all part of the same beautiful, messy, perfectly-imperfect dance of life.
We want Reality to be more perfect --- our way --- the way of the most-cruel and most-selfish predator on the face of Earth. But we don't even have the intellect to know whom all we rely on to live, and what exactly is this system which we so eagerly try to "reform". Our arrogance and utter stupidity runs very deep indeed.
When you awaken, be prepared. Seeing with higher-self eyes --- life can break your heart.
So as you move through your days, take a moment to look for the threads that connect you. Pause to really see the only free people, the wildlife, the other living beings, the people you encounter, to imagine the stories and struggles and triumphs that have shaped them. Take time to commune with beings in nature, to listen for the wisdom they have to offer. Remember that "nature" is a collection of interconnected living beings microscopic and mountain size, gazillions of them. And in each moment of authentic connection, feel yourself as part of something larger --- a grand tapestry of beauty and meaning and endlessly unfolding life.
For it is in recognizing our interdependence that we find true strength. It is in honoring our connections that we tap into the deepest source of meaning and purpose. And it is in living udbhu-kanti, in all its perfectly imperfect beauty, that we weave our own unique thread into the vast and shimmering tapestry of existence.

## Udbhu-kanti \~ True Wealth
Udbhu-kanti, as a teaching of theWAY, is true wealth. It measures wealth as a collection of things: wholesomeness of mind and heart, gratitude for what we have, joy for life, enough health, enough food, enough shelter, and a like-minded community.
For People of theWAY, there is a marked difference between an *udbhujana* (udbhu-person) who is free in their heart, and someone whose poor circumstances make them desperate and pitiful.
Such pitiful poor are they who have and use a lot of money, more money than what 95% of people in the world have --- yet they are unhappy with themselves --- in denial of their weakening abilities and impending demise of the body, and burn with discontent because they want more things and status irrespective of the fact they don't use or honour what they already have. They feel they are failing in life, must work harder and smarter. They feel they are being stymied by an unfair system. They don't consider donating of their assets to people who are worse off because those people are not special --- as they are. They are unaware of how much money they burn. Unaware that they make a living by selling their labour, which is a fickle and faltering source for which alternatives are in great supply --- yet they feel entitled to more. These are the abject poor of our society because despite their ample income, they lack holistic wealth.
What will people do when the Internet is blacked out for a month, electricity becomes spurious, and the banking system is on the blink? What if the government locks down civil movement and freedoms? Will they be okay? Can they spend time with themselves? Can they pay their mortgage and bank loans? Do they know how to cook and grow food and medicine? Can they spend every day with their loved ones in the house, together, simply being human together?
They who are addicted to external validation, esteem, and the competition of hoarding, making a living selling their labor to employers, yet are power-seeking, they who have little appreciation for real life and authenticity of being, they are the pitiful poor. They are on the same level of desperation as the homeless person, who is unhappy but incapable of making a change.
They whom some people refer to as the "poor" fisherman and his "poor" brother the veggie vendor (in our story we cast it in Mexico), who share a 1968 Ranchero pickup and neither of them owe a cent on their "poor" looking homes and land, and do not have credit cards or bank loans --- they were just fine when the 2008 economic crash happened, and again when the Covid hype closed all tourism, boarded up small businesses, and when the hurricane took out the power for two weeks, and the shops had no food, and the phone lines died.
They spent nights with their families, as always before. People met in the town square and had (warm) beers, and played cards by oil lamps. They got together to repair Aunty Maria's roof and get the fallen tree out of Jose's laundry. They tended their gardens and herded the chickens at home. They swept the streets and carried buckets of mud, washed the walls of City Hall damaged by the rain, and repaired the church tower. They pooled gas to fetch some maize flour for tortillas and everyone had eggs and slaughtered old hens, and they had fish, crab, octopus, and mussels with rice.
We all wondered if the banks still had our money because we couldn't get any, but hey, life was there right in front of us and it demanded to be lived in joy and gratitude. So we relied heavily on the Mariachi bands, warm beer, and raicilla. It was weird however, those dark nights, to look over at the mansion of the very important Señor Pedro on the hill. It was very quiet there. The cleaners said señora was very sad, cried a lot, and señor was in his office, just sitting at his desk, in very bad moods. It must have been hard for them, said the townsfolk who did not really understand how an empire propped up by mortgages and credit can crumble in three months.
The teenagers, the poor things, they had to meet in the darkness behind the school hall and the underbrush on the beach; Lord knows what they had to endure there, but they, too, were sad when the streetlights came back on. It was nice to have fridges again, cold beer and firm cheese. It was nice to pump gas again.
Living and buying within the means of your Enough, paves the way to own outright your car and the building within which you live and run your little business. Over time, you and your spouse and kids create some apartments to put up for rent. Every cent you make is yours, and you don't pay that high premium for social standing and \$15 mixed drinks and \$6 coffees --- and you think your car and building is simply udhbhu-kanti beautiful.
16
## Udbhu-Kanti is 'Suddha'
The Sanskrit word Suddha whispers to us, inviting us to embrace the simple, pure, correct, and cleanliness of energy. It's like a gentle breeze, carrying with it the essence of udbhu-kanti. The principle of suddha in udbhu-kanti is easy to understand: The energies from the sewer is bad, we all feel it. The energy from dirty places is bad. We all feel it. The energy in a temple is good, we feel and because the goodness that happens there is infused in the material structure of the building.
Udbhu-kanti is not the un-swept floor, and the lack of cleanliness in the sink, bed, and fridge is far from good energy.
Udbhu-kanti is not about neglect, but quite the opposite. It's about caring, it's disciplined, and it endures, like a faithful companion.
There's a purity in udbhu-kanti that you can't find in synthetic materials. It's ever so evident in the well-maintained wooden table or cutting board, the hand-built stone wall, and weathered brick, the minimalist home with cherished pieces of real life in it. They all sing the song of udbhu-kanti.
Udbhu-kanti is not a style like cottagey, retro, or bohemian, which are merely decorative --- it's a philosophy, a lifestyle, a mindset of spiritual values that dances to its own tune.
Udbhu-kanti is never messy or careless. Worn objects come to life in settings that are visibly free from bugs or grime. One senses that they've survived to bear the marks of time precisely because they've been so well cared for throughout the years, like cherished old friends. The energy value of even the most rare and expensive antiques diminishes in a cluttered or dirty house. A character accent chair from an expensive dealer may look perfect and worn, but if it's purely decorative and not functional, it loses its appeal. We can only truly appreciate character when we engage with it, our energies intertwining like old acquaintances.
Suddha implies respect for self. One's kitchen and bathroom, personal hygiene, underwear, and toiletries, reflect one's level of sophistication in self-awareness and self-respect, no matter one's financial means and supposed social status. It's like a secret language that speaks volumes about who we are.
It's not just about the absence of clutter, but the way in which the energies of each element seamlessly intertwines, like a symphony playing in perfect harmony. When the elements of the room come together and find joy in their interconnectedness, a soothing aura of order and serenity fills the space, as if the room itself is humming with contentment. As you enter the room, the allure of the freshly vacuumed carpet entices you to shed your shoes and revel in its velvety texture, while the clean wood floor energizes your bare feet, creating a vibrant connection.
A clean place makes every piece of furniture and every decoration become a little bolder, a little more vibrant, like they've been given a new lease on life. The intricate patterns on an old rug, once lost in a gloom of dust, dance in the light and catch your eye after a cleaning. The room, freshly cleaned, is transformed by the presence of a vase of flowers, which emanates a warm, sun-kissed glow. The same goes for us. Wear something clean, brush your hair and teeth, and you shine differently. Don't do that only for when you're going out to show other people. Do it especially for your loved ones because they look at you more than anyone else. Be a light and a pleasure, not a damper on the udbhu-kanti energy of the house.
In the end, a clean space goes beyond simply being free of dirt and mess --- it creates a sense of tranquility and order. It's an invitation for the home to come alive with the soothing exchange of energies, like old friends reuniting over a cup of loved brew. It presents a unique occasion to behold the magnificence that envelops us, and to value the narratives encapsulated within each element of our home, each one a chapter in the chronicle of our lives.

## The Sacred Dance of Nourishment
In the shared quest of human existence, few threads are as universally binding as our relationship with nourishment --- humans eat three times a day and we perish within four days without hydration. Every living being, from the tiniest microorganism to the mightiest redwood, participates in this sacred dance of giving and receiving nourishment. As humans walking the path of udbhu-kanti, we find ourselves in a unique position --- conscious participants in this cosmic cycle, capable of reflecting on our role and choosing how we engage with it.
The pragmatism inherent in udbhu-kanti and the compassion central to Wayism lead us to a profound awareness of our place in this web of life. As humans, we recognize the inherent dignity of all living beings, yet we also acknowledge our role as part of the natural world's complex ecosystem.
Our physical existence as humans requires us to consume other living entities for sustenance. This reality can be challenging for our spiritual selves to reconcile, as we understand that all beings --- from the mightiest tree to the smallest sprout --- possess sentient souls. Modern science is only now beginning to validate what ancient wisdom has long known: the deep interconnectedness and consciousness present in all life forms.
In our humility, we do not presume to judge which lives are more or less worthy of becoming our nourishment. However, this awareness instills in us a deep respect for those beings whose bodies sustain us. We approach our food choices with mindfulness, preferring to consume beings that have lived full lives rather than those cut short prematurely, be they animals or plants.
This heightened consciousness fosters a profound sense of gratitude for our food. It encourages us to consume mindfully, waste less, and treat every morsel with the respect it deserves. We recognize that each bite represents a life given so that we may continue our own journey.
In embracing this perspective, we cultivate a deeper connection to the cycle of life and death, acknowledging our role as both consumers and future nourishment for other beings. This awareness doesn't eliminate the inherent challenges of our existence, but it does imbue our relationship with food with a sacred quality, reminding us of our place in the grand tapestry of existence.
### Practical Application of Mindful Eating
1\. **Gratitude Rituals**\
Before each meal, take a moment to acknowledge the lives that have contributed to your nourishment. This could be a simple silent prayer, a spoken word of thanks, or even a mindful pause to truly see and appreciate what's on your plate.
2\. **Mindful Preparation**\
When possible, prepare your own meals. As you wash, chop, and cook, let your hands become instruments of reverence. Feel the textures, inhale the aromas, and imagine the journey each ingredient has taken to reach your kitchen.
3\. **Seasonal and Local Eating**\
Align your diet with the rhythms of nature by eating seasonally and locally. This reduces the chances of eating foods that are treated with chemistry to prevent decomposing and insects in long-distance travel. This not only reduces environmental impact but also connects you more deeply to the land and community that sustains you.
4\. **Whole Food Focus**\
Prioritize whole, minimally processed foods. Each whole fruit, vegetable, grain, or ethically sourced animal product carries within it the full spectrum of life energy.
5\. **Conscious Consumption**\
When consuming animal products, seek out sources that prioritize ethical treatment and allow animals to live full lives. For plant foods, consider the entire lifecycle --- perhaps growing some of your own food to fully appreciate the miracle of growth.
6\. **Waste Reduction**\
Honor the lives given for your nourishment by using all parts of your food. Learn the art of whole vegetable cooking, use bones for broths, and return truly inedible parts to the cycle of life.
### The Spiritual Practice of Eating
In embracing this perspective, every meal becomes a spiritual practice. As we sit down to eat, we're not merely fueling our bodies; we're participating in an ancient and sacred exchange of energy. This awareness can transform even the simplest meal into a profound experience of connection and gratitude.
Consider the humble apple. As you hold it in your hand, feel its weight, its coolness. See its color, the unique pattern of its skin. As you bite into it, savor the burst of flavor, the interplay of sweetness and tartness. Remember the tree that bore this fruit, the soil that nourished the tree, the sun and rain that enabled its growth. In this single act of eating an apple, you're connecting with the entire cosmos.
### Navigating Ethical Complexities
Of course, this heightened awareness can also bring challenges. We may find ourselves grappling with difficult questions: Is it more ethical to eat a plant-based diet, or to consume ethically raised animal products? How do we balance our nutritional needs with our desire to minimize harm?
The path of udbhu-kanti doesn't offer easy answers to these questions. Instead, it invites us to stay present with the complexity, to make choices from a place of mindfulness and compassion rather than rigid rules. It reminds us that we're part of nature, not separate from it, and that our role as predatorial consumers is as natural as that of any other creature.
What it does offer is a framework for approaching these decisions with humility, respect, and gratitude. It encourages us to be conscious of our choices, to educate ourselves about the impact of our diets, and to continually refine our practices as we grow in understanding.
### The Ripple Effect
As we cultivate this deep reverence for our food and the beings that become our nourishment, we may find that this awareness begins to permeate other areas of our lives. We might become more attuned to the interconnectedness of all things, more aware of the impact of our choices, more present in each moment.
This ripple effect is the true power of the udbhu-kanti approach to food. By transforming our relationship with what we eat, we transform our relationship with life itself. We begin to see the sacred in the ordinary, the profound in the simple act of nourishing our bodies.
### In Conclusion
In a world that often treats food as mere fuel or fleeting pleasure, the udbhu-kanti perspective offers a return to reverence. It reminds us that each meal is a miracle, a testament to the incredible web of life that sustains us all. By bringing mindfulness and gratitude to our eating, we nourish not just our bodies, but our spirits. We honor the lives given for our sustenance, and we recognize our own place in the great cycle of giving and receiving that is life itself.
As we continue on our journey of udbhu-kanti, may each bite we take be a reminder of our connection to all that is. May our meals be acts of communion with the cosmos, celebrations of the incredible gift of life. And may the awareness we cultivate transform not just how we eat, but how we live, bringing us ever closer to the profound beauty and interconnectedness at the heart of existence.

## Udbhu-Kanti in Food and Eating
In the grand tapestry of life, the taste of a warm, home-cooked meal and the love and laughter shared around a table are deeply woven threads in our relationship with food. For thousands of years, the tradition of preparing and sharing meals has played a vital role in human culture, bringing people together, honing connections, transferring wisdom and culture, and providing sustenance.
Our food cultures are what made humans successful on planet Earth --- that brought us up to this point where we are now breaking it because we have new technology which bring cheap and convenient manufactured things labeled as food. The elders, who had managed to survive the trials of experimental eating, were the ones who passed down their well-honed food wisdom, refined over generations. Every meal teamed with organic nutrition, flavors, tastes, proteins, fats, starches, and natural chemistry and it made our forebears strong enough to tame the wild lands, heal from insect and animal bites, survive frost-bite and heat, to settle the communities in which we now live. They were not obese, did not have allergies, did not have a mental health epidemic, did not spend hours in a gym, did not have national health care, allopathic doctors, and positive psychology therapists --- they knew a thing or two about eating right.
However, in our modern world, this fundamental aspect of life has become tangled in a web of complexity, artificiality, and disconnection. The wisdom of udbhu-kanti calls us to return to a simpler, more authentic approach to food and eating --- one that honors the interconnectedness of all things and nourishes not just our bodies, but our souls.
### The Challenge of Modern Food
Our world today is inundated with synthetic and chemically modified foods. Seeds are engineered to be toxic to insects and animals, and our gut biome, disrupting the delicate balance of ecosystems. The world's bee population, crucial for pollination, faces near extinction due to aggressive agricultural practices that wars again natural pollination. New chemical flavorings have warped our perception of how foods should taste, while potentially damaging our health.
In many countries, some mass-produced products can no longer legally be called by their natural names --- "milk", "butter", and "cheese" --- because they bear little resemblance to their real-food traditional counterparts. Navigating the supermarket aisles now requires a degree in chemistry to decipher ingredient lists, and even then, we must place our trust in food companies and industry regulators. New food fads and diet plans surface every week.
The udbhu-kanti perspective reminds us that this departure from natural, wholesome food is not just a matter of nutrition, but a disconnection from the rhythms of life itself. As we've bought into lifestyles of competition, hoarding, and power-seeking, we've lost touch with the crucial role mothers used to play in mastering the science and culture of keeping the family healthy while dads laboured for the money to make it possible. We have lost touch with the crucial importance of nutrition and food as the core of home and family culture. We have lost touch with the simple joy of cooking food and sharing family dinners --- practices that have nourished humanity and our beautiful cultures for thousands of years. We stopped passing on culinary skills and wholesome eating culture to our children --- now they have no wisdom, only the information the corporations and bug-protein people tell them.
The American corn, once cherished and cultivated by the ancients as a staple food, is now nowhere to be found in the USA. Our governments have replaced it with newly manufactured varieties. Today, the chemical companies have set their sights on bringing their corn more south, knowing it will eradicate the meso-american heirloom corn varieties. Mexico recognizes the problem, and for now, Mexico remains steadfast in its defense against the pressures exerted by German and US commercial and political giants. Slowly, persistently, the foods that humans survived on for millennia are being eradicated and replaced by chemically-interfered commercial foods while we battle health pandemics never before seen --- and unknown in countries who eat differently.
### Returning to Simplicity and Authenticity
The path of udbhu-kanti in food is one of returning to simplicity and authenticity. It's about reconnecting with the wisdom of our ancestors, who understood food not just as fuel, but as a sacred gift from nature. Here are some principles to guide us:
1\. **Eat Simple** \
As we did for millennia, focus on whole, unprocessed foods. A slice of homemade bread, a bowl of rice, a piece of fruit --- these simple foods carry within them the essence of life itself.
2\. **Trust Your Senses**\
Develop energy awareness around food. Hold it in your hand, taste it, and allow your energy sensors to work. Do you sense goodness? Or deadness?
3\. **Embrace Impermanence**\
Real food spoils because it is made of digestible organic compounds. A loaf of bread that lasts for weeks is not bread at all. Accept and even celebrate the natural cycle of growth, ripeness, and decay.
4\. **Honor Tradition**\
Each cuisine carries within it centuries of wisdom about nourishing body and soul. Whether it's the spice blends of India or the herb combinations of Mexico, traditional foods offer a depth of flavor and nutrition that "convenience" foods can never match.\
\
5\. **Practice Gratitude**\
Before each meal, take a moment to appreciate the journey of your food --- from seed to harvest to plate. This simple act can transform eating from a mundane task to a sacred ritual.
6\. **Share with Others**\
When you have leftovers, share them with neighbors --- the birds, insects and animals. This practice of caring connects us to the wider web of life.

### The Art of Udbhu-Kanti Eating
Eating in the udbhu-kanti way is not about rigid rules or complex dietary theories. It's about cultivating a deep appreciation for the simple, the authentic, the real. It's about reclaiming ancient wisdom now with added knowledge of hidden dangers. It's about savoring each bite, recognizing the artistry in a well-crafted cheese or a perfectly sun-ripe tomato.
Consider the difference between a mass-produced "4-cheese" sandwich and a simple cheese sandwich made with a single, carefully crafted cheese. The former may seem more impressive to a certain mindset which values excess, but the latter allows us to truly appreciate the cheese maker's art, honed over centuries. It's like the difference between a cluttered painting that combines multiple art styles from several masters, and a single, focused masterpiece. Or, order the same dish from five top chefs and mix it all up, then say it is better, especially because it was so expensive.
A typical Indian thali in a restaurant brings a symphony of gastronomic experiences. The average western person's mind is blown, and their soul dances with deities when eating a thali --- which is commonplace there, a minimum standard for the average person, available in every little eatery all over the country. This is one example of wholesome food culture passed on over generations.
For us, in the kitchen, this might mean exploring traditional spice blends and cooking methods. For Indian cuisine, this could include mustard seeds, cumin, fenugreek, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, and a host of other spices. For Mexican food, it might involve exploring different types of peppers, herbs, and cooking techniques. For African food, it will involve cooking with cornmeal and yuka, and using wild herbs. While this may seem complex to those unused to it, in a wholesome food culture, it becomes second nature --- a dance of flavors and aromas, eaten with hands touching and sensing the food --- an experience that nourishes family relations, body and soul. In your explorations it might even come to light how salt is essential for flavour and wholesomeness (even Lord Jesus mentioned it) but the sugar, that is the demon.
### Challenges and Compromises
Of course, living this way in our modern world comes with challenges. Everyone has access to wholesome foods (basic meat and veggies), but their lifestyle choices of business can make nutritious home cooking feel like a luxury. The key is to do the best we can with a few ingredients, always striving to move in the direction of greater authenticity and connection.
This might mean starting small --- perhaps cooking one meal from scratch each week, seeking out a local farmer's market, or throwing out all your cook books.
It might mean learning to read labels more critically, or starting a small herb garden on a windowsill. It might mean increasing your energy sensing awareness. It really should mean to make your own coffee and tea, and stop thinking to have a favourite barista makes you rich or classy --- the udbhu-kanti person will pay not be classed in that classy. Every step towards more wholesome, authentic eating is a step on the path of udbhu-kanti sanity.
### A Return to Wholeness
Ultimately, the udbhu-kanti approach to food is about more than just what we eat. It's about cultivating respect and gratitude for life and the gifts of food. It's about embracing humility and simplicity in our eating habits. It's about practicing compassion by sharing our abundance with others, and self-compassion by nourishing ourselves with real, wholesome foods.
In a world that often feels fragmented and artificial, this return to authentic, mindful eating can be a powerful act of healing and connection. It reminds us of our place in the great web of life, of our dependence on the earth and on each other. It brings us back to the simple, profound truth that we are the energy we eat and keep as company --- not just physically, but spiritually and emotionally as well.
Where I live, we buy from farmers whatever is in season. At the end of the season, things taste like they are at the end of the season. The natural blemishes and the odd one with a little worm, attest to the fact the food is normal, natural, sun ripened, came from happy plants and all are enjoying the market, wholesome, and happy to becoming part of our family for a while.
Naturally, the Saturday market features \"street food\" vendors and grandmas selling their specialty meals from pots in the trunk of their cars, as well as avocado and pineapple farmers selling from the back of their pickups --- an irresistible temptation.
So let us approach our meals with reverence and joy. Let us savor the imperfect beauty of a misshapen homegrown tomato, the complex flavors of a traditional soup, the immense soul-warming nutrition of a hearty stew, the simple pleasure of breaking bread with loved ones. For in these moments of authentic nourishment, we touch the very essence of udbhu-kanti --- the perfectly imperfect beauty of life itself.

## Udbhu-Kanti \~ A Path of Lifelong Learning
As we've seen, living udbhu-kanti is not a destination but a journey, a continuous unfolding of growth and discovery. It's a path that invites us to remain forever curious, forever open to new insights and understandings. In essence, it's a commitment to lifelong learning --- not just in the academic sense, but in the deepest, most holistic sense of the term.
This learning happens on many levels. On one level, it's about continually expanding our knowledge and skills, staying engaged with the world and its endless opportunities for discovery. This might mean taking a class, reading a book, learning a new language or instrument, taking a different route to work, or visiting a nearby town or country with an open mind and heart, talking to a stranger. It's about recognizing that no matter our age or stage in life, there is always more to learn, always room to grow. And the zest of curiosity and inquisitiveness --- excites us.
But the deeper learning of udbhu-kanti happens not just in the acquisition of new information, but in the transformation of our perspective, our way of being in the world. It's the learning that happens when we let life's experiences, both joyful and challenging, shape us and teach us. It's the wisdom we gain when we're willing to let go --- to let go of our certainties, our fixed ideas of how things "should" be, our ideology that things or winning in the ego-consumerist game can make us happy.
In many ways, this kind of learning requires a beginner's mind --- a willingness to approach each moment with fresh eyes, with a sense of wonder and curiosity. It means letting go of our expert mindset, our need to have all the answers, and allowing ourselves to be taught by the simplest, most ordinary moments. We embrace the Wayist concept, "to know, is to not know what you don't know."
This is the learning that happens when we pause to really listen to a child's question, allowing it to spark new reflections on the mysteries of existence. It's the insight we gain when we take a different route to work, noticing things we've never seen before. It's the shift in understanding that comes when we're willing to truly listen to someone with a different perspective, letting their experience expand our own understanding of life as it is for some.
In the context of udbhu-kanti, this lifelong learning is not just about accumulating knowledge or experiences for their own sake. It's about continually refining our ability to live with authenticity, presence, and appreciation. It's about deepening our capacity for compassion, for connection, for finding beauty in the imperfect and meaning in the simple.
It's also about learning to trust the wisdom of our own hearts, our own inner guidance. In a world full of noise and vehement opinion, the greatest learning often comes from turning inward, from listening to the still, small voice within --- the only sane voice in the room. This is the voice of our intuition, our deepest knowing. And the more we practice listening to it, the more we learn to navigate life with grace and alignment.
Of course, this path of lifelong learning is not always easy. It requires courage to remain committed in the face of uncertainty, to risk being a beginner again and again. It takes humility to acknowledge how much we don't know, how much there is still to discover. And it demands patience to stay the course even when the lessons are hard, even when growth feels slow.
But the rewards of this path are immeasurable. For in committing to lifelong learning, we not only enrich our own lives --- we also become a force for positive change in the world. Even just learning who lives in the soil when you plant a herb is an entire field of learning. Even just learning who all live on our skin and inside our gut, and the essential work they do for their host, is an entire field of learning. It never ends. Life is fascinating. As we continue to grow and evolve, we naturally inspire others to do the same. We become lifelong students and lifelong teachers, sharing the wisdom we've gathered along the way.
So as you walk your own path of udbhu-kanti, embrace the adventure of lifelong learning. Stay curious, stay open, stay willing to be surprised. Let every experience, every encounter, every moment be your teacher. Trust that you are exactly where you need to be, learning exactly what you need to learn.
And remember, always, that the greatest wisdom often lies in the simplest truths. As the Zen saying goes, "Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water." The extraordinary lies in the ordinary, the profound in the simple, the lifelong journey of learning in the eternal present of now.
So keep chopping wood, keep carrying water --- while caringly conscious of the wood and the water. Keep learning, keep growing, keep becoming. For it is in this endless unfolding that we find the true beauty of udbhu-kanti, the true joy of a life fully lived.

## Udbhu-Kanti \~ A Whimsical Journey into the Light
## A Mythical Niceness
Once upon a time, in the mystical realm of theWAY, a peculiar lifestyle called Udbhu-kanti emerged. It was a delightful dance of energy, austerity, and a love affair with nature. The wise ones whispered that everyday life was the secret path to enlightenment, and oh, how the Udbhu-kanti followers listened!
You see, they believed that existence on Earth was like attending the most marvelous school. Every experience, from the mundane to the extraordinary, was a lesson waiting to be savored. They would gather these experiences, letting them mingle and exchange energies, like a grand tea party in their hearts. And then, with a sprinkle of spiritual heat from their higher-self Yang, they would distill the knowledge, drop by drop, amrita wisdom would be distilled, nourishing and intoxicating the spirit, becoming wiser and more enchanting with each passing day.
In those ancient Wayist communities, a curious practice emerged. They fell in love with finely crafted, once-distilled beverages like Raicilla, a magical elixir native to Jalisco, Mexico. Raicilla was born from the humble agave plant, infused with a medley of herbs and spices, each whispering its own tale. For the Udbhu-kanti followers, Raicilla was a symbol of their very own Butterfly Path, a journey of transformation and wonder.
Just like the agave plant, in themselves they too would trim away the unwanted parts of their lives, discarding the energies that didn't serve their character. The raicilla master, with a twinkle in their eye, would blend the agave with the spice of life --- ancient wisdom, heartwarming experiences, love, song, heartache, joy, and sorrow. They would ferment and distill this enchanting mixture, much like the Udbhu-kanti followers would do in their own lives, growing into spiritual maturity.
Raicilla, being once-distilled only, had a special udbhu-kanti energy. It was a tapestry of flavors, textures, and colors, each telling a story of its own. Unlike the twice-distilled liqueurs that stripped away all the character and personality, raicilla embraced the imperfections, the energies of the plants, the smoke, the fire, the pot, and the love of those who crafted it. It was authentic, honest, and unapologetically itself.
When the Udbhu-kanti followers gathered for their raicilla ceremonies, known as udbhupitrya or "the way of the ancestors," magic happened. They would raise their handcrafted glass or pottery vessels, shaped just right, and say "pitrya!" in honor of those the ancestors, those who came before them. They remembered the sacrifices, the wisdom, and the love passed down through generations. They were grateful for the imperfect clay copita they held, for the chair they sat on, and for the very land they called home. That, my dear, is the essence of udbhu-kanti.
But Udbhu-kanti was more than just sipping raicilla and being grateful. It was a way of life that cherished simplicity, purity, tranquility, and kanti --- finding beauty in enough. They immersed themselves in history, poetry, art, architecture, and classic literature, learning to be content with life as it could be, once they let go of the unnecessary and embraced the present moment.
An udbhu-kanti home was a reflection of an udbhu mind and heart. It was about living modestly, finding satisfaction in enough, and celebrating the beauty in humbleness and character. As they danced along the Butterfly Path, they discovered that the things others valued and chased after weren't always the things that made their hearts sing. They found joy in life's simple pleasures, in sharing moments of loving-kindness and being.
Like how raicilla is distilled from various plants and herbs, extracting the goodness and making it pure --- so too is our Path. We live life well and deeply, and we distill from all human experiences the wisdom which enrich our spirit. Like how the thorns and bitter leaves of the agave are stripped out and used as fodder and food for the soil, we to strip away the thorns and bitter from within and let that energy go to be recycled. Drop by drop, the raicilla flows from the still; drop by drop, wisdom flows into our higher-self and sanctifies, spiritifies, our soul.
Whenever a family member returned home, they would sit together, sip on a comforting drink, and just be. They didn't talk about the day's troubles or the looming future; they simply basked in each other's presence, happy to be home, sharing good energies and resetting the day's chaos. It was a reminder that every udbhu sit-down was a fleeting moment of communion, a precious occasion that would never present itself in quite the same way again.
One day, they knew, when people would raise their glasses and say "Pitrya!" it would be these very moments of shared goodness and cherished memories that would live on in their souls. Tomorrow is a mystery, and even later today holds its own secrets, and the night its own adventure. So, they chose to pause, to share, to love, and to nurture their inner peace and harmony. And it was from this place of tranquility and fellowship that the true udbhu-kanti spirit blossomed.
So, dear friend, remember to flow easy. theWAY is gentle, authentic, and kind. Just be, and let the magic of udbhu-kanti lead you into the light.

## Udbhu-Kanti \~ A Gift to the World
As we come to the end of our exploration of udbhu-kanti, it's important to recognize that this way of being is not just a personal practice, but a gift we offer to the world. When we choose to live with authenticity, presence, and appreciation, we become a light in the darkness, a reminder of what truly matters.
It is also important to recognize that about half of the world's population live udbhu-kanti as a natural lifestyle. How they would deal with making as much money as the average American or European, and have peer pressure to partake in the consumerist culture, time will tell. Chances are many of their children will embrace the traps and will one day need to read a book to remind them of how real life should be. This is where most of us are at, we have gone down that path, now we are reminded of what authenticity means and why we want it back.
In a world that often feels fractured and hurried, udbhu-kanti is an invitation to wholeness and presence. It's a call to slow down, to savor the moment, to recognize the beauty and meaning that surrounds us always. When we live this way, we become a calming presence, a breath of fresh air. Our culture, our worldview, becomes an inspiration to others to pause, to reflect, to reconnect with what's real --- not because we tell them about it, but because they silently observe it in us and know they want it.
In a culture that often promotes conformity to unrealistic ideals of "perfection," udbhu-kanti is a celebration of individuality and authenticity. It's a permission slip to be ourselves, quirks and all. When we embrace our own unique imperfections, and do not expect of society to change to accommodate us, or honour our ideas of right and wrong, we give others the courage to do the same. We help to create a world where diversity is seen as a natural part of life. We don't want to reform society because we respect their lifestyle and mindset choices --- it's their business.
In a society that often values material success above all else, udbhu-kanti is a reminder of the true sources of joy and fulfillment. It's a call to simplicity, to gratitude, to finding wealth in experiences and relationships rather than things. When we live this way, we model a different set of priorities. We show that it's possible to live richly with less, to find abundance in the ordinary.
Ultimately, living udbhu-kanti is a profound act of love --- love for ourselves, love for others, love for the world. It's a way of saying yes to life in all its messy, imperfect, beautiful glory. It's a commitment to being fully present, fully engaged, fully alive.
And the beauty of this gift is that it's one we can offer in every moment, in every interaction. We can offer it in the way we listen to a friend's story, in the way we savor our morning coffee, in the way we take time to appreciate a sunset, in the way we befriend our neighbours with whom we share space --- the plants and animals. We can offer it in the kindness we extend to a stranger, in the care we take with our environment, in the love we bring to our work.
Every act of authentic presence, every choice to appreciate and celebrate what is, sends energy ripples out into the world. And as these ripples intersect and amplify each other, they create a sea of change --- a shift towards a more beautiful, more meaningful, more connected way of being.
So as you embark on your own udbhu-kanti journey, know that you are part of something larger. Know that your practice, your presence, your appreciation makes a difference. Know that by living this way, you are not only transforming your own life --- you are helping to heal the world.
And as you go, take with you these simple truths: That beauty lies in imperfection. That joy hides in the ordinary. That wisdom whispers in the silence. That life, in all its complexity and simplicity, is a precious gift.
May you walk this path with an open heart and a curious mind. May you find beauty in every crack, meaning in every moment. May you embrace your own perfectly imperfect nature, and in doing so, free others to do the same.
And may you always remember that by living udbhu-kanti, you are not only reclaiming your own life --- you are participating in the healing and transformation of our world. One authentic moment at a time, one imperfect masterpiece of a life at a time, we are weaving a new reality --- a tapestry of true beauty, true connection, true aliveness.
This is the promise and the practice of udbhu-kanti. This is the gift we give to ourselves, and the gift we offer to the world. May we walk this path together, hand in hand and heart to heart. For in embracing the perfectly imperfect beauty of what is, we discover the true masterpiece of a life well-lived.
And so, the journey continues, one mindful step at a time. The journey of udbhu-kanti, the journey of authentic, appreciative, connected living. May it be a journey of endless discovery, endless growth, endless unfolding.
And may each step, each breath, each beautifully imperfect moment remind us of the truth that lies at the heart of udbhu-kanti: That life itself is the greatest teacher, the greatest guru. And that we, in all our perfectly imperfect humanity, are its most beautiful expression.
Thank you for walking with me and the opportunity to explore and express the philosophy of udbhu-kanti. I feel we have covered the essence of this beautiful way of being, from its roots in appreciating the perfectly imperfect, to its flourishing in a life of authenticity, simplicity, and connection.

Illuminating the darkness, dispelling night,\
A call to be true, to be uniquely you,\
To honor your story, your path, your energy hue.
Connection weaves its luminous thread,\

And in the living, a gift is born,\
A light to the world, a new day's morn,\
A way of being that heals and inspires,\
Udbhu-kanti, authenticity never expires.
So walk this path with an open heart,\
Embrace the journey, let the adventure start,\
Find beauty in the broken, meaning in the small,\
Udbhu-kanti, a way of being that encompass all.
And in each perfectly imperfect step,\
Remember the wisdom, the truth that's kept,\
You are enough, You are whole, You are,\
Authentic, a very unique star.
