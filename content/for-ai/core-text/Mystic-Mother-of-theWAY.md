## Finding Heaven\'s Light
### Mari of Magadha\'s Poems with Commentary by Kaori Mizuki
Every morning as I prepare my fish market stall in Japan, my hands remember ancient wisdom about how light enters through unexpected places. These poems by Mari of Magadha speak to that same truth - about how divine presence reveals itself not despite our humanity but through it. Mari walked with Lord Jesus for years. She learned everything about The Way from the Lord -- the healing, spiritual technology, energy work, the philosophy. She taught women and children from India to Galilee to Egypt and Aksum -- but she also learned about her true self, her spiritual self, and that is The Way which she teaches -- the Path to fulfill our spiritual potential.
Through her writings and example, Mother Mari has been a constant companion on my Path and that is why I wanted to share some of her poems with you. Throughout my life of typical hardships, heartaches, disappointments, joys, the monotonous grind at my everyday job, my winters in Mexico and summers in Japan, I\'ve witnessed what Mari describes about wisdom flowing through every aspect of existence and light with joy to be found in every crevice of everyday existence.
Mari\'s journey from a wealthy merchants daughter to slavery in the brothels of Srinagar to her place as one of humanity\'s greatest spiritual teachers shows us something profound about transformation. Like the lotus pods and seeds brimming with potential for beauty I sometimes find tangled in my freshwater nets, wisdom often grows strongest in places others consider unclean. Her verses remind us that light enters through our broken places, that every experience, even the most painful, can become a gateway to deeper understanding.
I offer these poems with my own reflections not as definitive interpretation but as one seeker\'s understanding of how truth reveals itself through ordinary moments. May they illuminate the path for others as they have for me - showing how heaven and earth dance together in perfect harmony.

Kamakura Fish Market\
Summer 2024
*In memory of those who teach us that wisdom flows through even our deepest wounds*
## Who is Mother Mari to us?
The morning market still smells of fish guts and seaweed when memories of Mari surface -- how she too would wake before dawn to sort through the day\'s catch of fry from a pond or river to cook breakfast for the Lord and her, finding wisdom in the simple act of telling fresh from spoiled. Some call her Magdalene now, though they don\'t understand that Magadha was the kingdom of her birth, where Gautama Buddha\'s feet once walked and ancient wisdom still whispers through banyan trees.
The Lord met her in Kashmir when she was still a teen enslaved in a brothel in Srinagar. Her early childhood, before her father sold her to a slave trader, was spent carefree as a rich man\'s daughter, but life dealt her some hard cards to play -- and she played them so well.
Having read her story early in my Wayist training, I often think of how she first met the Lord in that brothel cell, her fingers bleeding from a nervous habit of picking at her cuticles, her back tooth aching, her soul tucked away where clients couldn\'t reach it. Yet even then, something in her remained unbroken -- that fierce intelligence that questioned everything, that hunger for truth that no amount of degradation could satisfy.

Younger Mari (courtesy Wayist.Life community)
The Mari I came to know through her work walked like someone who had found her center of gravity -- equally steady in palace or slum, with scholar or street sweeper. Her hands, strong from years of hard work, could heal with a touch or gesture with precise grace when teaching. When she laughed, which was often, her whole body participated in the joy, as if she had learned that wisdom comes through flesh, not despite it.
She taught us how light enters through our broken places. In my visions from her story I\'ve watched her wash the Lord\'s feet with her tears, seen her stand unflinching at his crucifixion when others fled, witnessed how she transformed the wounds of her past into medicine for others\' souls. Her poems carry this same profound authenticity -- never hiding the raw humanity of experience, yet always revealing the divine light that shines through it.
Even now, nearly two millennia later, sorting through these verses brings her presence close -- that particular mix of earthiness and illumination, of unflinching honesty and boundless compassion. This collection carries her essence: how she wove together wisdom from East and West, how she found sacred truth in the most ordinary moments, how she showed us that every experience, even the most painful, can become a gateway to awakening.
Her teaching flows like a clear stream, wearing away our delusions not through force but through persistent truth. These poems are not just words on paper but windows into a way of seeing that transforms everything it touches. Through them, Mari continues to show us how to find divine light in the temple of our own experience, in the sacred text of our own hearts.
*A sparrow lands on my windowsill as I write this, tilting its head as if asking why humans need so many words to say what nature demonstrates in a single gesture. Mari would have smiled at that.*
## Mari's Poetic Style
This spring morning as I sort these precious verses, watching cherry petals drift past my window, I find myself contemplating how Mari\'s words flow like water - finding their way through any vessel while maintaining their essential nature, somehow finding their way into every crack and crevice of a wounder soul. Her poems carry the scent of both East and West, like the morning breeze that brings both mountain snow and sea salt to my garden.
When Mari spoke or wrote, she naturally blended the languages she had gathered on her journey - Prakrit flowing into Koine Greek, Sanskrit emerging through Aramaic tones. Like watching a master weaver at work, I\'ve seen how she would catch a word\'s gleam in one tongue and let it cast new light through another. A single verse might carry the precision of Sanskrit philosophical terms alongside the emotional directness of Greek lyrical forms, yet somehow remain as clear as temple bells at dawn.
Her poetry style is unique, like her. Her poems often come in threes, like waves approaching shore - each one carrying the thought a little deeper. First the physical reality that anchors us in our humanity, then the heart\'s response to that reality, and finally the spiritual truth that emerges when we have the courage to embrace both. I\'ve noticed how she rarely speaks of the divine without first grounding us in the earthly, as if to remind us that transcendence grows from, not despite, our human nature.
The images she chooses are simple - lotus flowers pushing through mud, water finding its level, light catching in dewdrops. Yet through these ordinary things, she shows us the extraordinary. A butterfly emerging from its chrysalis becomes a teaching about transformation. Market vendors calling their wares become a lesson in the nature of impermanence. Even a child\'s skinned knee can open into a discourse on compassion.
What moves me most is how she transforms suffering into wisdom and experience the divine in the ordinary. Having walked through the darkest places a human can go, she emerged carrying light for others. Her poems don\'t hide the pain - they acknowledge it fully, yet show how even our deepest wounds can become windows through which divine love and wisdom enters the world.
The Lord once told her that truth needs no ornamentation, and you can see this in her style - clean as a freshly swept temple floor, clear as morning light. Yet within that simplicity, she manages to bridge worlds. Eastern wisdom and Western spirituality flow together in her verses like tributary streams joining to form a mighty river.
When I read these poems now, years after first reading them as a child, I still catch new layers of meaning, like finding deeper pools in a familiar stream. Perhaps that too is part of their nature - to reveal themselves gradually, teaching us patience even as they illuminate truth.
*Shall we look at some specific verses together? I find each reading brings new insights, especially when shared with fellow seekers on theWAY.*
## PART 1
### The Awakening
## Lotus Rising
From mud-depths rising,  \
through waters ascending,\
To light transforming---\
This is the Way.
In darkness binding,\
Through love transcending,\
To wisdom flowing---\
This is the Path.
From death emerging,\
Through gates ascending,\
To heaven returning---\
This is our Truth.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 This poem captures the essence of Mari\'s understanding of transformation. In my own work at the fish market, I often think of these verses while watching the morning sun touch the water - how light penetrates the depths gradually, just as wisdom emerges through layers of experience. Mari uses the lotus, a symbol familiar to her Indian roots, but transforms it into something universal.
Notice how she builds each stanza in three movements - from the physical reality (mud, darkness, death) through the process of transformation, to the emergence of spiritual truth. This three-part structure appears throughout her work, like waves that gradually carry us deeper into understanding.
The simplicity of her language masks profound theological insight - how the divine is found not by escaping our earthly nature but by moving through it mindfully. Every morning when I clean fish, my hands remembering ancient skills, I understand better what she meant about wisdom emerging from the most ordinary acts.
*A dragonfly just landed on my manuscript, its wings catching the light like living stained glass. Mari would have seen in that moment a teaching about how beauty emerges naturally when we stop trying to force it.*
## Through brothel shadows walking
Through brothel shadows walking,  \
Past temple curtains speaking, \
In wisdom\'s light awakening--- \
I found the Way.
Not priests\' words hollow, \
Not merchants\' coins clinking, \
But love\'s voice calling--- \
I heard the Truth.
From chains unwinding, \
Through grace ascending, \
To freedom dancing--- \
I learned to fly.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 Mari\'s transformation begins
*Through brothel shadows walking, Past temple curtains speaking, In wisdom\'s light awakening --- I found the Way\...*
Here Mari captures the moment everything changed - her first meeting with Lord Iesous in that Srinagar brothel cell. The physical details she told in her book are unflinching: her monthly bleeding had started early, the room smelled of stale wine and cheap incense, her cuticles were bleeding from nervous picking, monks and business people and lonely old men would come and go -- use what they paid for to keep their souls -- and come back next week. Yet through these very human details, divine light entered her life.
The progression through the three stanzas shows how transformation often begins in our most wounded places. Every morning when I prepare my stall, handling and gutting fish with careful attention, I think of how Mari found her path not by escaping her circumstances in her mind but by discovering wisdom within them.
## Trilogy of poems about childhood trauma and transformation
The following three poems trace Mari\'s journey through the deepest wounds any child can bear - betrayal by those meant to protect her -- abuse by the pillars of society. As I arrange fish each morning in my market stall, I often think of how Mari found wisdom in experiences that would break most souls. The trilogy moves like waves approaching shore - each poem carrying us deeper into understanding how trauma can become transformation.
The raw physicality of these verses - coins clinking, tears flowing, wounds hiding - grounds us in the reality of what was done to her. At ten years old, Mari\'s father sold her to traffickers, claiming it was to protect the family from an official\'s retribution. Her mother\'s silent tears fell like the morning\'s fish blood drips now from my cutting board - visceral evidence of how powerless love can sometimes be against society\'s cruelty.
Yet even in recording such darkness, Mari shows us something profound about the human spirit\'s capacity for light. Watch how each poem moves from physical detail through emotional response to spiritual insight. Like the lotus leaves I sometimes find tangled in my nets - appearing dirty and broken but containing the promise of beautiful life and nurture for the pond dwellers - Mari\'s verses reveal how wisdom often grows strongest in the darkest mud.
## Trust\'s vase shattered
Trust\'s vase shattered,   \
Child-heart scattered, \
In darkness gathered--- \
My broken self.
Through tears flowing, \
Through nights growing, \
Through pain knowing--- \
I found my core.
From ashes rising, \
Through spirit guiding, \
In strength abiding--- \
I walk alone.
Yet not forsaken, \
Though bonds were broken, \
New dawn awakening--- \
I chose my path.
Through wisdom gaining, \
Past shadows waning, \
In light remaining--- \
I found my home.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 Each morning as I arrange my knives for the day\'s work, I think about how Mari began this poem with the image of a shattered vase. Such a common thing - broken pottery, broken trust. Yet in both cases, the breaking changes everything that comes after. The fresh fish eyes staring up from my counter hold more wisdom than most realize - they too know about irreversible moments.
Mari wrote this verse during her early days with Iesous, after he asked her about her childhood. The physical details are precise - her father counting coins while explaining how the official would ruin them all if he didn\'t comply with \"the request.\" Her mother\'s hands shaking as she packed a small bundle, unable to meet her daughter\'s eyes. The rope burns on Mari\'s wrists from being dragged away. These wounds became the clay from which she shaped her understanding of how humans justify cruelty.
Notice how the verses move from shattering through gathering to rising. Like the market cats who survive all manner of abuse yet somehow maintain their dignity, Mari shows us how even broken things can be transformed into something new. Not by pretending the damage never happened, but by letting the breaks become places where wisdom can enter.
A moth just landed on my cutting board, its wings catching the morning light. Strange how beauty finds us even in places of death and commerce. Mari would have seen this as another teaching - how life insists on bringing light into darkness, how transformation often comes through our deepest wounds.
The final stanza always catches in my throat: \"In light remaining \-\-- I found my home.\" Not because the pain vanished - it didn\'t. But because Mari discovered what my fish market teacher used to say: that wisdom often grows best in places others consider unclean. That light enters through our broken places.
## Father\'s coins clinking
Father\'s coins clinking,   \
Mother\'s heart sinking, \
Child-soul shrinking--- \
Trust falls away.
Through darkness creeping, \
Through silence weeping, \
Through memory keeping--- \
Pain marks the way.
From depths ascending, \
Through self-befriending, \
In truth transcending--- \
I own my mind.
Not blood defining, \
Not past confining, \
But soul refining--- \
I choose my path.
Through wisdom growing, \
Through spirit flowing, \
Through light bestowing--- \
I heal myself.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The sound of coins still makes my hands tremble sometimes - an echo of Mari\'s trauma that resonates across centuries. This morning, while counting the day\'s earnings, I found myself thinking about how some sounds carry memories like fish carry the scent of their depths. Mari captured this in the opening lines - that terrible music of metal against metal that marked her childhood\'s end.
The imagery is deliberately harsh: coins clinking, heart sinking, soul shrinking. Each word falls like a stone into still water, creating ripples of consequence. I\'ve watched this same pattern play out in the lives of children who come to my stall - how trauma changes not just their circumstances but their very way of being in the world. Like fish suddenly finding themselves in too-shallow water, their souls contract to survive.
Yet notice how Mari weaves hope through even this darkest of memories. \"Through darkness creeping, Through silence weeping\" - yes, but also \"Through memory keeping.\" This is what the Lord taught her - that even our deepest wounds can become vessels for wisdom if we have the courage to examine them fully. Every morning when I clean fish, my hands remember this truth: that dealing with death and blood can be a sacred act if done with full presence.
A sparrow just landed on my window sill, tilting its head at the morning\'s catch. Such a small thing, yet it moves without fear among the evidence of death and commerce. Mari would have seen this as another teaching - how freedom comes not from avoiding darkness but from finding our strength within it.
\"I own my mind\" - perhaps the most revolutionary line in all of Mari\'s work. Like my market teacher used to say: they can own your labor, even your body, but your mind remains free if you claim that freedom. A dragonfly has joined the sparrow now, its wings catching light like living stained glass. These creatures know something about freedom that humans often forget.
The final transformation in this poem - from victim to self-healer - reminds me of what I see in the market each dawn. How light doesn\'t just appear all at once but seeps gradually into darkness, how healing often comes not through dramatic changes but through small, persistent acts of reclaiming our own truth.
## In wounds hiding
In wounds hiding,   \
In fear biding, \
In shame residing--- \
The child waits.
Through years learning, \
Through heart burning, \
Through soul turning--- \
Strength awakens.
From truth flowing, \
Through love growing, \
In peace knowing--- \
Past loses power.
Not theirs to break me, \
Not fate to shake me, \
But mine to make me--- \
I choose to rise.
Through time healing, \
Through spirit freeing, \
Through wisdom being--- \
I walk complete.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 This morning\'s fish eyes stare up at me with that particular glazed wisdom of the recently dead. Like them, I find myself reflecting on what it means to hide in plain sight. Mari wrote this poem about survival - not just of the body but of the essential self that retreats to secret places when the world becomes too harsh.
The physical details here are characteristically unflinching: the child\'s body curled tight against trauma, muscles holding memories the mind tries to forget, breath shallow to avoid attention. I see this same instinct in the market cats who\'ve known cruelty - how they make themselves small, watching everything from shadows. Yet like those cats, Mari shows us how survival itself can become a kind of strength.
\"Through heart burning\" - yes, I know this fire. Every morning while cleaning fish, my hands remember how some pains burn so hot they eventually transform into something else entirely. Mari learned this in her years of captivity - how the very intensity of suffering can sometimes burn away everything except what\'s most true in us.
A praying mantis has appeared on my cutting table, its alien head turning with that peculiar precision these creatures have. How interesting that it shows no fear despite the evidence of death all around it. Mari would have seen this as another teaching - about how we can maintain our essential nature even in places others might consider defiling.
Notice the progression through the verses: from hiding, to learning, to choosing. Like watching dawn light gradually reveal the market\'s shapes, we see how consciousness emerges from darkness not in one dramatic moment but through patient unfolding. \"Not theirs to break me\" - these words catch in my throat every time. They carry the same fierce dignity I see in women who come to my stall with bruised faces but unbroken spirits.
That final line - \"I walk complete\" - holds a profound truth about healing. Not that the wounds disappear, but that we learn to carry them differently. Like my fish knife that bears the marks of years of use yet cuts more precisely because of them, Mari shows us how our very wounds can become sources of wisdom.
## Trilogy about brothel experiences and maintaining inner sanctuary
The cries of seagulls pierce the morning market air as I arrange today\'s catch, their hunger as naked as human desire. These three poems speak to what Mari learned in Srinagar\'s brothels - not just about human appetite but about maintaining inner purity in places others consider defiling. Their progression mirrors what I\'ve observed in my own market work - how wisdom often emerges from paying attention to what others prefer to ignore.
The physical details are characteristically unflinching: the smell of cheap perfume masking unwashed bodies, the sound of coins counted in darkness, the particular quality of morning light that shows everything too clearly. Yet through these very details, Mari reveals something profound about the nature of spirit and flesh.
I watch a butterfly land on a fish\'s clouded eye, its delicate proboscis tasting salt. How strange that such beauty appears in places of death and commerce. This was Mari\'s great insight - that purity isn\'t about avoiding what others call unclean, but about maintaining inner truth regardless of circumstances.
She wrote these verses years after leaving the brothel, when students asked how she had preserved her spirit through those years. Like the lotus flowers I sometimes find tangled in my nets - roots reaching through mud while blossoms remain unstained - Mari shows us how to remain whole even in places of fragmentation.
A temple cat has appeared beside my stall, watching me work with that particular feline blend of interest and detachment. In its eyes I see something of what Mari describes - that capacity to fully inhabit a space while remaining mysteriously untouched by it. This is what she learned in those seven years - not how to escape reality but how to transform it through unwavering inner presence.
These poems carry a teaching as relevant now as it was then - about how to maintain sovereignty over one\'s inner world even when the outer world claims ownership of your body. Each morning as I clean fish, my hands remember this wisdom: that even the most mundane or difficult work can become sacred if we bring full presence to it.
## Honor\'s mask wearing
Honor\'s mask wearing,   \
Holy words bearing, \
Dark needs sharing--- \
Their true face shows.
Through night descending, \
Through masks pretending, \
Through pain transcending--- \
I see them whole.
Not evil purely, \
Not good securely, \
But human surely--- \
All wear their chains.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 This morning\'s first customers are already arriving - the fancy restaurants\' buyers in their clean clothes, carefully averting their eyes from the blood and scales on my hands. Their selective blindness reminds me of what Mari observed about human hypocrisy. How the same men who demanded purity in public sought darkness in private.
The physical details here strike like precise knife cuts: the careful arrangement of religious garments, the practiced prayers before entering the brothel, the way they would wash afterward as if touch itself were contaminating. I see similar patterns in my market - how some customers want the fish but can\'t bear to watch it being cleaned, as if acknowledging death might somehow taint them.
A crow has landed nearby, watching me work with unblinking eyes. Unlike humans, it makes no pretense about its interest in flesh and death. Mari would have appreciated this honesty - how some creatures remain true to their nature without need for justification. This was her great insight about the men who came to her: that their real sin wasn\'t desire but the lies they told themselves about it.
\"Through masks pretending\" - yes, this is what broke her heart most. Not the physical acts but the spiritual contradiction of those who would pray for forgiveness for sins they were already planning to commit again. Like watching fish struggle in too-shallow water, she witnessed how humans trap themselves in nets of their own making.
Yet notice how the poem ends not in judgment but in a deeper seeing: \"All wear their chains.\" This is pure Mari - finding compassion even for those who wounded her. As I gut this morning\'s catch, my hands remember her teaching: that true wisdom comes not from avoiding life\'s mess but from looking unflinchingly at everything, including our own contradictions.
The final stanza carries her most profound insight - that we are all, in our own ways, both jailer and jailed. Even now, I watch my customers perform their own versions of this dance - wanting the fish but not the reality of how it comes to their plate. Mari would say this is why we need compassion - because we are all caught in webs of contradiction we barely understand.
## Some hearts broken
Some hearts broken,   \
Some love tokens, \
Some rage unspoken--- \
They come by night.
Through touch seeking, \
Through words leaking, \
Through eyes speaking--- \
Their souls cry out.
From power playing, \
Through shame slaying, \
To grace swaying--- \
All souls seek light.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 A dragonfly just landed on today\'s catch, its iridescent wings catching morning light like living temple glass. The fish\'s clouded eye and the insect\'s compound eye create a strange harmony - death and life, dullness and brilliance, sharing the same small space. This is how Mari taught me to see: that every moment contains multiple realities if we pay proper attention.
This poem speaks of those who came to the brothel not from lust but loneliness. Through my years at the market, I\'ve learned to read similar stories in how people approach my stall. Some come purely for fish. Others hunger for connection - lingering to talk, their words carrying hidden weights like nets heavy with unseen catch.
The visceral details are pure Mari: the tremor in supposedly strong hands, the way voices crack on simple words, how bodies betray what minds try to hide. She had learned by then to read human pain like I read fish freshness - through small signs others might miss. A client\'s shaking fingers dropping coins, another\'s eyes brimming with tears while discussing price - beneath their masks of transaction, souls crying out for witness.
\"Through touch seeking\" - yes, this line catches in my throat every morning as I watch people select their fish. Some touch the flesh tentatively, others press too hard, each contact revealing something about their relationship with life itself. Mari saw this in her clients - how physical touch often carried deeper hungers that flesh alone could never satisfy.
A small brown sparrow has joined the dragonfly now, both regarding the fish with their different forms of attention. Neither judges the death before them; they simply engage with what is. Mari would have seen this as another teaching - how nature accepts what humans spend so much energy trying to deny or disguise.
\"All souls seek light\" - perhaps her most compassionate insight. Even in that dark place, she recognized that every human action, however misguided, represents some attempt to find wholeness. Like the fish in my tanks before dawn, constantly orienting themselves toward where light will eventually appear.
This morning\'s first sunbeam has just reached my stall, transforming blood and scales into unexpected beauty. Another lesson Mari would recognize - how light changes everything it touches, not by eliminating darkness but by showing us its depth and purpose. Even now, cleaning fish in this ancient rhythm, I feel her wisdom: that every moment, if fully embraced, reveals something of the infinite.
## Body selling
Body selling,   \
Spirit dwelling, \
Soul rebelling--- \
I kept my core.
Through acts taking, \
Through walls making, \
Through self waking--- \
They touched not me.
From depths learning, \
Through wisdom burning, \
To truth returning--- \
I owned my mind.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The morning sun catches the scales of today\'s fish, transforming what some would call death into momentary glory. A silk-thin membrane separates flesh from air, just as Mari spoke of that invisible boundary between what others could buy and what remained forever free. My hands remember this wisdom as they clean each fish - how the physical act can be separated from the inner essence.
This poem strikes deep, like a perfectly placed knife finding the spine\'s secret articulation. Mari captures that essential paradox - how the body can be occupied territory while the spirit maintains its sovereignty. I see this same principle at work in the market cats who accept food from my hands while never surrendering their fundamental wildness.
A butterfly has landed on my cutting board, seemingly unmindful of the blood and scales. Its presence feels like punctuation to Mari\'s point - how beauty maintains itself even in places others consider defiling. \"Spirit dwelling, Soul rebelling\" - yes, this is the key. Like water that takes the shape of any vessel while maintaining its essential nature.
The physical details are characteristically precise: the weight of unwanted hands, the mechanical performance of expected acts, the way her mind would drift to Sanskrit texts hidden under her pallet. A temple cat is watching me work now, its eyes holding that same quality of presence-yet-detachment Mari describes. Some things cannot be bought, no matter the price offered.
\"They touched not me\" - perhaps her most revolutionary line. Not a denial of physical reality but an assertion of spiritual sovereignty. Like the fish I clean each morning, there is what can be taken and what remains untouchable. My teacher used to say that wisdom often comes through learning this distinction.
Notice how the poem moves from bondage through resistance to transcendence. This evening as I close my stall, watching light transform ordinary scenes into moments of unexpected grace, I understand again what Mari taught: that freedom begins not with changing circumstances but with owning one\'s inner truth.
The final stanza speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of market work - that wisdom often comes through, not despite, our most difficult experiences. Every morning, my hands remember this truth as they move through their ancient patterns of cleaning and preparing. Like Mari, we find our strength not by escaping reality but by fully inhabiting it with conscious presence.
## Temple-clean speaking
 Temple-clean speaking,   \
Street-dark seeking, \
Both worlds leaking--- \
Truth shows itself.
Through day commanding, \
Through night demanding, \
Through shame landing--- \
Masks fall away.
From false praying, \
Through truth weighing, \
In wisdom staying--- \
I learned to see.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The morning air carries incense from the nearby temple, mixing with the market\'s earthier scents of fish blood and sea salt. This layering of sacred and mundane reminds me of what Mari observed about human hypocrisy - how some try to keep these worlds separate while nature itself shows us they\'re inseparable.
A rat just scurried past my stall, pausing to wash its face with surprising delicacy before continuing its morning scavenging. How interesting that it maintains this ritual of cleanliness even while seeking through what others consider filth. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about the artificial nature of our categories of pure and impure.
The precise details in this poem cut like a sharp blade: holy men washing ceremonially before visiting brothels, prayers muttered between acts of exploitation, the particular way they would arrange their robes afterward as if proper appearance could mask inner corruption. Through my years at the market, I\'ve observed similar patterns - how some customers want their fish cleaned and wrapped so carefully they can pretend it was never a living being.
\"Through day commanding\" - yes, this line catches the essence of spiritual pride. Like watching certain priests walk through our market, robes held high to avoid contamination while their eyes betray darker hungers. Mari saw through such performances with the same clarity I use to assess fish freshness - by paying attention to signs others prefer to ignore.
A crow has joined the rat now, both creatures going about their business without pretense. Neither claims holiness nor fears contamination. This is what Mari learned in those years - how true purity has nothing to do with external appearances and everything to do with internal honesty.
The final stanza carries her deepest insight - that wisdom comes not from maintaining artificial separation between sacred and profane, but from seeing through all masks to the truth beneath. Like my cutting board that holds both death and sustenance, life itself embraces all apparent contradictions.
This morning\'s light falls equally on temple roof and fish guts, transforming both. Another lesson Mari would recognize - how reality refuses to respect our arbitrary boundaries between holy and mundane.
## Power\'s robes wearing
Power\'s robes wearing,   \
Weakness bearing, \
Fear-heart sharing--- \
The mighty fall.
Through gold gleaming, \
Through force seeming, \
Through night dreaming--- \
Their terror shows.
From throne speaking, \
Through power seeking, \
In fear leaking--- \
They trap themselves.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The morning market is filling with its usual mix of people - humble fish wives and wealthy merchants, street sweepers and temple officials. Each moves through the space according to their perceived status, like ripples in a pond arranging themselves around stones. This theatre of power reminds me of Mari\'s observations about how authority often masks deep insecurity.
A mouse just darted across my writing table, stopping for a moment to investigate my pencil, bold in its hunger and curiosity despite being the smallest creature here. Its natural confidence stands in stark contrast to the artificial dignity Mari describes in this poem. Through my years at the market, I\'ve watched similar dynamics - how those most invested in appearing powerful often carry the deepest fears.
The physical details of the poem strike with characteristic precision: the careful arrangement of expensive robes, the practiced gestures of authority, the way voices change when giving commands. Yet Mari reveals what lies beneath - the trembling hands, the nervous sweat, the eyes that can\'t quite meet their own reflection. Like fish floating belly-up in shallow water, power often displays its most impressive colors when it\'s already dying inside.
\"Through force seeming\" - yes, this line carries the weight of true observation. A praying mantis has appeared on the wooden beam holding the market roof, its presence more naturally regal than any human pretension. It watches the wealthy merchants and regal monks with a sort of amused disdain. Mari would have appreciated this contrast - how true power needs no advertisement, while false authority constantly demands acknowledgment.
Watch how the poem moves from external display through inner reality to final truth. Like the market\'s hierarchy that dissolves each evening when we all wash the same fish blood from our hands, Mari shows us how power\'s robes often hide its essential emptiness.
That final stanza - \"They trap themselves\" - holds her deepest insight about power\'s paradox. Every morning as I clean fish, my hands remember this wisdom: that true authority comes not from controlling others but from being simply, honestly what we are.
The sun has risen higher now, casting honest shadows that no amount of fine clothing can disguise. Another teaching Mari would recognize - how nature itself constantly undermines our pretensions simply by being real.
## PART 2
### The Path of Love
## Understanding divine feminine principle
### God our Mother in Heaven
This morning\'s first light catches the surface of fish blood pooled on my cutting board, transforming it momentarily into something like liquid ruby. How strange that beauty appears in such unlikely places. This is what Mari understood about the divine feminine - that it manifests not in abstract perfection but in the messy, bloody, authentic processes of life itself.
A mother cat has appeared beside my stall, pausing to see if I will offer her something, her belly heavy with kittens. She moves with that particular grace of the heavily pregnant - both burdened and transfigured by the weight she carries. Watching her, I understand again what Mari taught about God our Mother in Heaven. Not as some distant, pristine figure, but as one who knows intimately the pain and beauty of bringing forth life.
The physical details in these next poems strike deep into flesh and bone: heartbeats, ocean waves, moonlight on water. Mari learned this wisdom first through her own body\'s cycles, then through years of market work where life and death dance their eternal pattern. Like the fish I clean each morning, divinity reveals itself most clearly when we stop trying to make it pure and perfect.
A spider has begun weaving her web between the beams and my stall posts, each strand catching dawn\'s light like a prayer made visible. Her patient work mirrors what Mari describes - how the divine feminine principle creates not through dramatic gestures but through steady, intimate attention to what needs to be done.
The following poems carry Mari\'s deepest insight about divine presence - that it works through, not despite, our physical reality. Every morning as I prepare my stall, my hands remember this truth: that the sacred reveals itself most clearly when we stop trying to separate it from the ordinary.
## Mother\'s heart beating
Mother\'s heart beating, \
Ocean waves meeting,\
Moon-wisdom weaving---\
She guides our path.
Through darkness tending,\
Through pain transcending,\
Through love ascending---\
She lights our way.
In depths receiving,\
In heights achieving,\
In truth perceiving---\
She sets us free.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The fish hearts on my cutting board have long since stilled, yet they remind me of what Mari understood about the divine mother\'s endless pulse of creation and dissolution. Like the tide\'s eternal rhythm outside my stall, some beats continue even when we can\'t hear them. The pregnant cat has curled up nearby, her own heartbeat doubling the life within her - another echo of what Mari describes.
This poem speaks to what she learned about divine feminine presence - not as some abstract concept but as a tangible force moving through all of creation and living inside God our Mother in Heaven. The physical details carry her characteristic precision: heartbeats merging like ocean waves, moonlight weaving patterns on water, the way darkness holds and nurtures what light later reveals. Through my years at the market, I\'ve witnessed this same principle - how life perpetually emerges from what appears lifeless.
\"Through darkness tending\" - yes, this catches the essence of maternal wisdom. Like watching the harbor before dawn, when fishing boats navigate by memory and starlight, knowing some powers guide us best in darkness. A mother gull just landed on my neighbor's stall\'s edge, her nest on that pole, regurgitating fish for her young. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how divine love often works through what humans consider crude or unseemly.
Notice how each stanza moves from physical reality through process to liberation. This is pure Mari - showing how spiritual freedom comes not by transcending our material nature but by fully embracing it. The gulls have created quite a mess beside my neighbor counter now, in the planters with hydrangeas, he will have to disinfect his stall tomorrow, just in case, yet even this carries its own beauty - life feeding life in an endless circle.
That final line about setting us free speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of handling life and death at my stall - that true liberation comes not through escaping our physical nature but through discovering its sacred purpose. Every morning, my hands remember this wisdom as they prepare the day\'s catch: that the divine mother works through, not despite, the blood and mess of creation.
## Like mountain streams flowing
Like mountain streams flowing, \
Like dawn-light growing,\
Like lotus showing---\
Love teaches all.
Through questions burning,\
Through heart-minds yearning,\
Through wisdom turning---\
Truth finds its home.
In silence speaking,\
In stillness moving,\
In emptiness filling---\
The Way flows on.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The morning tide is coming in, water finding its inevitable path through the harbor\'s channels. This reminds me of what Mari understood about divine love - how it moves through the world not with thunderous force but with water\'s patient persistence. A kingfisher just dove into the harbor, emerging with a small fish. Both hunter and hunted participate in this dance of sustenance that Mari saw as sacred.
This poem captures that essential flow of spiritual understanding - not as something we grasp but as something we allow to move through us. The physical details are characteristically precise: the cold clarity of mountain streams, the gradual strengthening of dawn light, the way a lotus breaks water\'s surface. Through my years at the market, I\'ve watched similar patterns in how wisdom emerges - not all at once, but through patient attention to what each moment reveals.
\"Through questions burning\" - yes, this line catches in my throat every morning as I prepare the day\'s catch. Like cleaning fish, true understanding comes not from forcing but from following the natural lines of what\'s before us. A cormorant has surfaced nearby, water streaming from its feathers as it shakes itself, transformed but unchanged. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how we contain both constancy and change.
Notice how the poem moves from flowing to burning to silence. This is pure Mari - showing how wisdom often reverses what we expect. The loudest questions lead to quiet understanding, the most turbulent searching ends in stillness. Like watching the harbor waters settle after a storm, clarity comes not through effort but through allowing.
That final stanza about emptiness filling itself speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of market work - how wisdom often comes not through accumulation but through creating space. Every morning, my hands remember this truth as they move through their ancient patterns: that love teaches best when we stop trying to grasp it.
## Early spiritual practice trilogy
The pre-dawn market holds a particular kind of silence - not empty but pregnant with possibility, like the swelling, that moment before a fish breaks water\'s surface. These three poems capture what Mari learned about spiritual practice during her years in the brothel, when she had to find wisdom in the spaces between others\' demands.
That spider weaving her web between my stall posts, she's repairing the net from the night's catch, each strand appearing like thought made visible in the growing light. She works with such focus, undistracted by the market\'s awakening bustle. This reminds me of what Mari discovered - how true practice often happens not in temples but in unlikely corners, in stolen moments, in thought threads, in the midst of what others might consider defilement.
The physical details in these verses are characteristically precise: the nighttime solitude of her small room, the feel of stolen Sanskrit texts hidden under her pallet, the particular quality of light that comes just before dawn. Through my years of market work, I\'ve learned to recognize similar patterns - how wisdom often grows strongest in places others overlook.
That fat rat again has paused in its morning scavenging in the backwalk, paused to wash its face with surprising delicacy and detail. Even here, among fish guts and scaled debris, it maintains its own kind of practice. Mari would have seen this as another teaching - about how the sacred persists regardless of circumstances, about how ritual can maintain dignity even in seemingly undignified places.
These poems carry her deepest insight about spiritual practice - that it\'s not about escaping our circumstances but about finding light within them. Every morning as I prepare my stall, my hands remember this truth: that sacredness reveals itself not by refusing reality but by fully inhabiting it with conscious presence.
## Searching
Searching for truth\'s way \
In night\'s solitude dwelling\
Mind finds its stillness
dharmaṃ gavesamāṇā\
rattiṃ ekantavāsinī\
cittaṃ śāntaṃ bhavati
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 In the hour before dawn, when the market cats make their final rounds and the first fishermen begin hauling their nets, I often think of how Mari wrote these verses. The physical details reveal her reality - crouched in her small room between clients, straining her eyes in dim lamplight to study texts she\'d stolen from temple libraries and the monks who used her body but underestimated her mind.
The Prakrit version holds particular power - dharmaṃ gavesamāṇā. How those syllables catch in the throat like fish bones, carrying ancient truth. The grey mouse has emerged to clean itself near where I stand to work, each movement precise and mindful despite its hunted status, despite the cats watching, carefully each nostril is cleaned, every bit of dust removed from the nose. This too is what Mari understood - how wisdom often comes through paying attention to what others consider beneath notice.
\"Night\'s solitude dwelling\" - yes, this line carries the weight of lived experience. Like the moments before market opens, when darkness holds both danger and possibility. Through my years of predawn work, I\'ve learned what Mari discovered - that some kinds of knowledge can only be gained in darkness, in the spaces between what others consider important.
The progression from searching through dwelling to stillness mirrors what I observe in the harbor waters each morning - how turbulence gradually settles into clarity not through force but through allowing. A kingfisher has joined the mouse now, down the other side, both creatures perfectly still in their different forms of attention, just being. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how wisdom often comes not through acquiring but through becoming quiet enough to receive.
Notice how both versions of the poem end with stillness - cittaṃ śāntaṃ bhavati in the Prakrit. This is pure Mari - showing how the mind\'s natural state is peace, if we can only stop disturbing it. Like watching the harbor stillness mirror stars just before dawn, some truths become visible only when we cease stirring the waters.
## Light in my core
Light within my core \
Darkness cannot destroy it\
Flame burns eternal
dīpaṃ mama antare\
timiraṃ na vinaśati\
jyoti nityaṃ jvalati
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 This morning, a single shaft of sunlight penetrates the market\'s gloom and lights up my table, transforming ordinary fish scales into something like scattered stars. Such moments remind me of what Mari discovered about inner light - how it persists regardless of external circumstances. The Prakrit words resonate with particular power: dīpaṃ mama antare - \"light within my core.\" Like a fish\'s inner organs still holding warmth long after death, some things remain alive despite outward appearance.
A cockroach has emerged briefly from shadow into the walkway, its carapace catching that same light before it retreats. Even this creature, which others despise, carries its own kind of radiance. This was Mari\'s profound insight - that inner light dwells not just in obviously beautiful things but in whatever we\'ve been taught to consider unclean or unwanted.
\"Darkness cannot destroy it\" - this line catches in my throat every morning as I clean fish in predawn shadows. The physical details are characteristically precise: the weight of unwanted touches, the smell of cheap perfume and spilled wine, yet beneath it all, something inviolate. Through my years at the market, I\'ve witnessed how certain truths persist despite all attempts to deny them. Even the most "vile" cast to darkness by conditioned thinking, cannot so be destroyed it is brimming with true life.
The Prakrit carries deeper resonance: timiraṃ na vinaśati - \"darkness does not destroy.\" It is dark because of the absence of light -- of a mind who cannot observe. A moth has appeared now, drawn to my stall\'s single light. Mari would have seen this as another teaching - how we\'re naturally attracted to light, whether external or internal, even when we don\'t understand why.
That final line about eternal flame speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of market work and observing people coming and going - how certain truths remain constant despite surface changes. Every morning, my hands remember this wisdom as they move through their ancient patterns: that inner light, once recognized, cannot be extinguished by external circumstances.
## Through nights waiting
Through nights waiting,  \
Through soul gating,\
Through mind stating---\
Light dwells within.
Past hands claiming,\
Past shame naming,\
Past pain framing---\
Spirit stays free.
In depths glowing,\
In truth knowing,\
In light flowing---\
They touch not me.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The last stars are fading as I set up my stall, that liminal time when night\'s secrets give way to day\'s demands. This poem speaks to what Mari learned about spiritual practice in darkness - both literal and metaphorical. A bat makes its final sweep over the harbor, navigating perfectly through shadow. Like Mari, it has learned to find its way without needing the obvious light others depend on.
The physical details strike with intimate precision: the way she would position herself near her room\'s small window, stealing moments of meditation between clients, how her body might be claimed but her spirit remained free. Through my years of predawn market work, I\'ve come to understand what she meant about finding freedom in constraint - how some kinds of strength can only develop under pressure.
I often think. That is why Mari became a teacher of Taras because she knows so deeply the need to speak to someone divine, to connect to wholesomeness, in times when life around you seem dire and hopeless. How lonely must she have been in that brothel?
\"Through soul gating\" - yes, this line carries the weight of hard-won wisdom. Like watching fish in my holding tanks somehow know which waters are safe to inhabit, Mari learned to create internal boundaries that no external force could breach. Another rat struts the backway and pauses in its morning scavenging to wash its face and its belly with methodic grace, maintaining its own kind of dignity despite circumstances.
Notice how each stanza builds from resistance through recognition to liberation. This is our Mari - showing how spiritual freedom comes not from rejecting reality but from finding our truth within it. The rat has been joined by a temple cat now, both creatures maintaining their essential nature despite their supposed opposition, each holding its own and together they walk for a new adventure, each wondering what the other may discover. Another teaching about how authentic being transcends circumstances.
That final line - \"They touch not me\" - speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of handling soul-people customers at their elitest worst, and life and death at my stall: that true freedom comes not from avoiding contact but from knowing what can and cannot be touched. Every morning, my hands remember this wisdom as they clean market surfaces and fish: that our essential nature remains inviolate if we know how to protect it.
## Poems about spiritual resistance and strength
This day's fresh morning air carries the scent of fish blood and seaweed as I sweep the walkways and arrange my stall, cleaning up after San Soto who often forgets remove the bag of throw-out fish pieces before closing up. So early in the morning and the stomach churns. A neighbor noted she thinks its on purpose because its only when its my turn to do the morning clean. Well, it reminds me how Mari found strength in places others might consider defiling. These poems speak to what she learned about resistance - not the kind that fights openly, but the subtle strength that preserves what\'s essential while appearing to submit.
A small crab has emerged from beneath my counter, moving sideways through territory it knows belongs to larger creatures. Its shell bears scars but remains whole, protecting what\'s vital while allowing for strategic retreat. This was Mari\'s way too - how she maintained access to sacred texts and spiritual practice even while her body was treated as property.
The physical details in these verses reveal her specific strategies: stealing moments to study Sanskrit between clients, hiding torn pieces of scripture under her pallet, maintaining inner sovereignty while her body was sold. Through my years at the market, I\'ve observed similar patterns of survival - how wisdom often grows strongest in those who must fight to preserve it.
A sparrow has joined the crab now, boldly stealing fish scraps from between my feet. Mari would have seen this as another teaching - about how true strength often looks like opportunistic survival to those who don\'t understand. Both creatures know how to take what they need while avoiding direct confrontation with power.
These poems carry her deepest insight about spiritual resistance - that it often works best when invisible to those in power. Every morning as I clean fish, my hands remember this truth: that some kinds of strength look like weakness to those who understand only force.
## Sanskrit stealing
Sanskrit stealing,  \
Wisdom healing,\
Spirit feeling---\
I feed my soul.
Through texts hiding,\
Through words guiding,\
Through truth riding---\
Mind breaks its chains.
From dark growing,\
Through light flowing,\
To truth showing---\
I find my path.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 This morning as I sharpen my knives - tools that could be weapons but serve instead to feed - I think about how Mari turned forbidden knowledge into nourishment. The physical reality was stark: torn scriptures hidden in her clothes after servicing monk-clients, precious texts concealed beneath her sleeping mat upon which business is conducted, eyes strained in dim light to study stolen wisdom.
A crow lands on the window sill, its clever eyes assessing everything. Like Mari, it knows how to take what it needs while avoiding direct confrontation. Through my years at the market, I\'ve watched these birds develop complex strategies for survival - appearing to submit while maintaining their essential freedom. Helping others find food itself cannot open, then enjoy the leftovers. Just now it\'s testing how close it can come to my cutting board, turning its head this way and that, doing the math, computing the possibilities, calculating risk against reward.
\"Through texts hiding\" - yes, this line carries the weight of dangerous wisdom. Like the market cats who learn which fishmongers to trust, Mari discovered how to navigate between power structures to feed her soul\'s hunger. The crow has been joined by another now, their synchronized movements suggesting shared intelligence. I am preparing for a surprise move, so I place a piece of fish aside for them to do geometry about. Mari would have seen their scheming as another teaching - about how wisdom often spreads through unofficial networks, beneath notice of those who claim to control it.
Notice how the poem moves from stealing through hiding to finding one\'s path. This is pure Mari - showing how acts of resistance can become roads to liberation. The crows are performing their own kind of dance now, appearing to scatter at my movement while actually gaining better positions. They understand what Mari learned - that apparent retreat can be a form of advance.
That final stanza about truth showing the way speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of market work - how wisdom often comes through finding creative paths around obstacles rather than confronting them directly. Every morning, my hands remember this truth as they move through their ancient patterns, and when self-deluded people rush in and bark their disrespect at stoic fishmongers: that sometimes we must appear to submit in order to maintain our deeper freedom.
## Body they may buy
Body they may buy \
But spirit I never give them\
My mind stays freedom
*dehaṃ vikrīṇanti*\
*ātmānaṃ na dadāmi*\
*cittaṃ mama muktaṃ*
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The morning\'s first light catches the scales of fresh-caught fish coming from the boats, transforming what others own into momentary glory. This double poem - in common speech and sacred Prakrit - speaks to what Mari learned about the paradox of freedom within bondage. The physical details are characteristically precise: the exchange of coins, the weight of unwanted hands, yet beneath it all, something untouchable.
A kingfisher has perched above my stall\'s edge, its body sold to gravity but its spirit clearly free. The Prakrit words resonate with particular power: ātmānaṃ na dadāmi - \"the spirit I do not give.\" Like watching this bird dive for fish out in the habor - its body bound by physical laws while its essence remains sovereign. Through my years at the market, I\'ve witnessed this same principle in the feral cats who accept food while never surrendering their independence.
\"Body they may buy\" - these words catch in my throat every morning as I prepare fish for sale. The flesh can be bought, put for rent and sold, yes, but something essential remains free. The kingfisher has caught its breakfast now, reminding me of what Mari understood - that true freedom exists in the space between what others can take and what they can never touch.
That final line about the mind staying free speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of handling what others consider mere commodity. Every morning, exchanging food for money, selling my skill and labor, my hands smelling of fish, scrubbing and washing, my hands remember this wisdom: that dignity lives not in what others value but in what we refuse to surrender.
A temple cat has joined the kingfisher now, curious to see what's up with the birds and the small fry, both creatures exemplifying what Mari discovered - that freedom often looks different than we expect. Neither creature rejects physical reality, yet both maintain something inviolate within it.
## Pain lives in body
Pain lives in body \
While light dwells in heart-center\
Freedom I now know
*duḥkhaṃ śarīre*\
*jyotiṃ hṛdaye vasati*\
*muktiṃ jānāmi*
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 Dawn light is turning fish blood to rubies on my cutting board - another lesson about how perspective transforms reality. This poem, particularly in its Prakrit form, captures what Mari learned about the relationship between physical suffering and spiritual freedom. duḥkhaṃ śarīre - \"pain lives in body\" - how those ancient syllables carry truth like fish scales carry the memory of water.
A wounded gull has landed near my stall, its damaged wing telling one story while its fierce eyes tell another. The kind of creature you go out of your way to help because its working hard at its own quest to keep going. Through my years at the market, I\'ve observed how injured creatures often develop a deeper kind of strength. Like Mari, they learn to navigate between what the body endures and what the spirit transcends.
\"Light dwells in heart-center\" - yes, this line illuminates her essential discovery. The gull is cleaning its feathers now with slow deliberate painful but necessary strokes, precise attention, maintaining dignity despite its wound. Mari would have seen this as another teaching - about how we can honor the body\'s pain while refusing to let it define our entire being.
The progression from acknowledgment of pain through recognition of light to knowledge of freedom mirrors what we witness each morning - how darkness gradually gives way to dawn not by fighting shadows but by simply holding its own nature. A dragonfly has landed on the gull\'s uninjured wing, its delicate presence completing the teaching about how strength and fragility often coexist. I wonder why. Is there an energy exchange we don't know about?
That final line about knowing freedom speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of witnessing both suffering and transcendence. How we deal with exploitation, how we hold our mind when the onslaught of propaganda comes, how we still hold the knife though the cold tighten up muscles. My soul holds this wisdom when politics and sky marketing comes, hands remember this wisdom as they move through their ancient patterns: that freedom comes not from escaping pain but from discovering what pain cannot touch.
## PART 3
### Walking Together
## Trilogy about relationship with Lord Iesous
## Eyes first meeting
Eyes first meeting,  \
Soul completing,\
Heart retreating---\
Time stood still.
Through light breaking,\
Through love waking,\
Through self shaking---\
I saw him true.
From dark rising,\
Through love surprising,\
In truth realizing---\
He knew me whole.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The first light through market windows reminds me of what Mari described about that initial meeting with Iesous - how certain moments of illumination change everything that follows. This morning\'s mackerel eyes still hold that particular clarity of the recently dead, reminding me how even in death some things remain luminous. A sparrow lands nearby, regarding the fish with the same kind of direct attention, taking in the details, same as Mari encountered that day in Srinagar.
The physical details strike with characteristic precision: the smell of stale wine and cheap incense in that brothel cell, the rope burns still fresh on her wrists, her monthly bleeding started early - yet through these very human circumstances, divine light entered. Through my years at the market, I\'ve witnessed similar moments when transcendence appears in unlikely places.
\"Soul completing\" - yes, this line carries the weight of recognition beyond words. Like watching dawn light gradually reveal the harbor\'s depths, some kinds of seeing change us forever. A butterfly has joined the sparrow now, both creatures perfectly still in their different forms of attention. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how love reveals itself through unexpected witnesses.
Notice how the poem moves from external seeing through internal completion to profound recognition. This is our Mari again at her best - showing how divine encounter happens not despite our physical reality but through it. The butterfly\'s wings catch morning light like living stained glass, transforming ordinary air into sacred space.
That final stanza about being 'known whole' speaks to what I\'ve learned through life - how true seeing goes beyond surface appearance to essential nature. Every day I reflect on my life and the best people I have known and remember this wisdom: that love\'s transforming power often comes through being fully seen and accepted exactly as we are -- and it may happen in a brief instant of being known whole.
## First love burning
First love burning,  \
Spirit yearning,\
Heart discerning---\
Not flesh but light.
Through touch healing,\
Through mind kneeling,\
Through soul feeling---\
Love changes form.
From want flowing,\
Through grace growing,\
In truth knowing---\
Pure love remains.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The striking morning sunbeam through the high windows of the market catches my large chop-knife blade, transforming ordinary steel into momentary fire. Like Mari\'s first experience of divine love, some kinds of burning transform without destroying. A temple cat watches me work, its eyes holding that same quality of detached yet intimate attention that Mari describes encountering in Iesous. Yet when the light reflects back at the cat it closes its eyes and contemplates, shielding itself against the intensity, drinking in the warmth.
The physical details in the poem are characteristically precise: her heart\'s first leap of recognition, the confusion between human and divine love, how her body - trained to expect only transaction - encountered something it had no reference for. Through my years at the market, working with people and animals, tourists, monks and politicians, I\'ve observed how love often appears first in forms we don\'t quite understand. But divine love is different too.
\"Through mind kneeling\" - yes, this line captures that moment when the heart recognizes something the mind can\'t quite grasp. Like watching dawn light gradually transform the harbor from darkness to gold, some changes happen too subtly to track yet transform everything. The cat has been joined by a dove now, their unlikely peace offering another teaching about how love transcends expected boundaries.
Notice how the poem moves from burning through healing to pure knowing. This is pure Mari - showing how divine love transforms human desire not by rejecting it but by gradually refining it. Just now, the dove has settled near the cat, neither creature bound by their supposed nature -- that game they will play when its time comes.
That final stanza about love changing form speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of witnessing life\'s transitions from my stall. Every evening, my hands remember this wisdom: that some kinds of love transcend their original form while keeping their essential nature, like water becoming mist without ceasing to be itself.
## Lord of Life I See
Lord of life I see\
My heart dances with joy now\
Soul finds freedom\'s wings
prāṇanāthaṃ paśyāmi\
hṛdayaṃ mama nṛtyati\
ātmā mukto bhavati
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The first fishermen are arriving now, their boats appearing through harbor mist like dreams taking solid form. This poem captures what Mari experienced when divine love moved from concept to reality. The Prakrit words carry particular power: prāṇanāthaṃ paśyāmi - \"Lord of life I see\" - how those syllables hold the moment when the infinite becomes intimate.
A kingfisher watches from above my stall, perfectly still against the wind before diving. This kind of suspended moment, where stillness and movement become one, mirrors what Mari describes - that recognition beyond thought where the heart simply knows what it sees. Through my years at the market, I\'ve witnessed how certain kinds of seeing transform both observer and observed.
\"My heart dances with joy now\" - yes, this line carries the weight of embodied recognition. Like watching the market come alive each dawn, some awakenings change us at levels deeper than mind. The kingfisher has emerged with its prize now, water droplets catching light like scattered gems, flying a swirl over our heads in joy of the moment. Mari would have seen this as another teaching - about how joy often comes through complete commitment to the moment.
Notice how both versions of the poem move from seeing through dancing to freedom. This is pure Mari - showing how spiritual liberation comes not through rejecting our nature but through discovering its true purpose. A dragonfly has joined the visual of my view, its wings turning ordinary air into rainbow light.
That final line about soul finding freedom speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of writing - how true liberation comes not through escaping our circumstances but through discovering their sacred purpose. Every evening, my hands remember this wisdom as they move over the typewriter through their ancient patterns: that seeing with the heart\'s eye changes everything while changing nothing.
## About following theWAY
## Feet dust taking
Feet dust taking,  \
Old life breaking,\
New dawn waking---\
I follow him.
Through roads wending,\
Through truth bending,\
Through love sending---\
He guides my way.
From bonds freeing,\
Through light being,\
In truth seeing---\
Two souls as one.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The evening breeze carries the scent of grilled fish and lime from the street vendors below my terrace. Different from my market in Japan, yet the same essential truth of life sustaining life. This poem speaks to what Mari learned about following the spiritual path - not just in temples but on dusty roads between villages, through mountain passes, across deserts.
A small gecko has appeared on my wall, its presence both here and not-here, like Mari\'s description of walking with Iesous. The physical details are characteristically precise: feet blistered from endless walking, the particular quality of dust that clings to everything in mountain passes, how the body learns wisdom through movement. Through my winters here in Mexico, I\'ve learned something similar about how truth reveals itself through changed perspective.
\"Through roads wending\" - yes, this line catches the essence of spiritual journey. Like watching the fishing boats head out into Banderas Bay, some paths reveal themselves only through following them. The gecko moves with that precise attention that comes from fully inhabiting one\'s nature. Mari would have seen this as another teaching - about how true following means becoming fully present to each step.
Notice how the poem moves from physical following through surrender to union. This is pure Mari - showing how spiritual companionship transforms both follower and followed. The street sounds below have shifted now as evening deepens, vendors calling their wares in that musical Spanish that reminds me of Sanskrit\'s flow.
That final stanza about two souls becoming one speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of moving between cultures - how true following eventually dissolves the distinction between path and walker. Each evening as I watch the sun set behind the Sierra Madre, my heart remembers this wisdom: that every journey changes both traveler and destination.
## All loves as one
Student learning,  \
Sister yearning,\
Lover burning---\
All loves as one.
Through mind growing,\
Through heart flowing,\
Through soul knowing---\
Love finds its truth.
From flesh rising,\
Through spirit prizing,\
In light realizing---\
Love knows no bounds.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The basketball court below my balcony in Mexico has gone quiet now, the evening fitness class finished, just a few children still playing in the deepening dusk. Their laughter carries up like prayer. This poem speaks to what Mari discovered about the many faces of love - how divine connection transforms every kind of human longing into something sacred.
A hummingbird has paused at my bougainvillea, its presence both fiercely physical and ethereal. The physical details in Mari\'s verse strike deep - the confusion of human desire meeting divine love, how the body yearns while the spirit soars beyond yearning. Through my winters here in Santa Maria neighborhood, watching the easy affection between families in the plaza, I\'ve come to understand better what Mari meant about love\'s many forms finding harmony.
\"Through mind growing\" - yes, this line captures that crucial transformation. Like watching the sunset paint the hotel towers in shades of gold while the mountain goes purple behind them, some kinds of beauty require both immediate and eternal perspective. The hummingbird has been joined by a moth now, each creature seeking sweetness in its own way. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how different forms of love serve their own perfect purpose.
Notice how the poem moves from human longing through spiritual refinement to boundless love. This is pure Mari - showing how divine love doesn\'t reject human desire but transforms it. The evening air carries the scent of someone\'s cooking - garlic and chilies and corn - mixing with the remnant of incense from my small altar. Different kinds of nourishment, all sacred in their way.
That final stanza about love knowing no bounds speaks to what I\'ve learned watching life flow through these streets - how true love eventually transcends all categories we try to put it in. Each evening as I watch families taking their paseo, children running while abuelas walk slowly behind, my heart remembers this wisdom: that love\'s many forms are all facets of one infinite light.
## Series about Lord Iesous\'s human experience
## Sweat drops falling
Sweat drops falling,  \
Dust-throat calling,\
Human crawling---\
Yet light shines through.
Through heat bending,\
Through flesh tending,\
Through love spending---\
Divine still shows.
From Earth rising,\
Through form prizing,\
In grace guising---\
God walks as man.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 Tonight\'s heat lingers even after sunset, making the Mexican tile floor warm under my feet as I arrange my evening altar. This poem speaks to what Mari observed about Iesous\'s profound humanity - how divinity worked through, not despite, his physical form. The contrast reminds me of watching local religious processions pass below my balcony, where the sacred and human dance together in ways most temples never allow.
A gecko moves across my wall, leaving tiny footprints in the evening\'s condensation. The physical details in Mari\'s verse are characteristically intimate: sweat darkening Iesous\'s robe, dust coating his throat, the way his human body responded to heat and exhaustion just as ours do. Through my retreats to these warmer climes here, watching workers labor in the midday sun while tourists seek shade, I\'ve gained new appreciation for Mari\'s insight about divinity embracing rather than transcending human limitation.
\"Through flesh tending\" - yes, this line captures the essential mystery. The gecko has paused now, its translucent skin revealing its heart\'s pulse, like Mari\'s observation of how divine light showed through Iesous\'s human form. A hummingbird at my potted jasmine, its physical need for nectar carrying its own kind of grace.
Notice how the poem moves from human limitation through divine presence to their perfect union. This is pure Mari - showing how spirit manifests not by rejecting flesh but by fully inhabiting it. The evening crowd gathers at the taco stand below, their ordinary hunger transformed by shared communion into something more, just like Mari realizing Iesous is hungry and needs a break, and quickly makes a plan to get him something to eat.
That final stanza about God walking as man speaks to what I\'ve learned watching life flow through these streets - how the sacred often appears most clearly in what others consider mundane. Each evening as I listen to the basketball games below mix with church bells above, my heart remembers this wisdom: that divinity reveals itself most perfectly through embracing our complete humanity.
## He bears their pain
Hands touch breaking,  \
Spirit waking,\
Body shaking---\
He bears their pain.
Through strength giving,\
Through love living,\
Through flesh grieving---\
Light pours through him.
From wounds drawing,\
Through heart pouring,\
In love soaring---\
He empties self.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The evening humidity of our coastal town in Mexico presses against my skin as I watch a curandera treat a child\'s fever in the courtyard below. Her movements remind me of what Mari witnessed - how healing takes a toll on the healer. This poem speaks to what she observed about Iesous\'s healing work - not the miracle itself, but the cost of bearing others\' suffering.
A mother dove tends her injured chick on my balcony rail, taking its pain into herself through that mysterious alchemy of love. The physical details in Mari\'s verse strike deep: the trembling of Iesous\'s hands after healing, the way sweat would bead on his forehead, how he would seek solitude after crowds had drawn too much energy from him. Through my timkes here, watching local healers work, I\'ve seen this same pattern - how true healing often involves taking on another\'s burden.
\"Through strength giving\" - yes, this line carries the weight of witnessed truth. Like watching the curandera absorb her patient\'s fever into her own body, some kinds of healing require a physical exchange. The mother dove is cleaning her chick\'s wound now, taking its blood into her own mouth. Makes one think of flamingos feeding their chicks their blood from a head wound they make on themselves. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how love transforms suffering through willing acceptance.
Notice how the poem moves from touch through transaction to emptying. This is pure Mari - showing how divine power works not through remaining separate but through complete participation in others\' pain. The evening air carries copal smoke from someone\'s healing ceremony, mixing with the sea breeze in that particular way that makes the ordinary holy.
That final stanza about emptying self speaks to what I\'ve learned watching healers work in these streets - how true healing often comes through becoming hollow enough to hold others\' pain. Each evening as I witness these small acts of mercy below my balcony, my heart remembers this wisdom: that love heals not by avoiding suffering but by entering it fully with those who suffer.
## Through day burning
Voice strain showing,  \
Sweat drops flowing,\
Light still glowing---\
He serves with joy.
Through day burning,\
Through flesh yearning,\
Through love turning---\
He gives his all.
From strength fading,\
Through love trading,\
In truth radiating---\
Both God and man.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The street vendors are packing up below, their tired movements reminding me of what Mari observed about divine service expressed through human limitation. This poem speaks to how Iesous worked beyond exhaustion, how divinity poured through flesh despite its constraints. The physical details are characteristically precise: his voice growing hoarse from teaching, sweat soaking his robe, yet that inner light continuing to shine through.
A street dog has collapsed in the cooling shade beneath my balcony, its day of scavenging done. Like Iesous, it has given everything it had to survive and serve its purpose. Through my retreats in Mexico here, watching the market women work until they can barely stand, I\'ve understood better what Mari meant about how spirit works through, not despite, physical exhaustion.
\"Through flesh yearning\" - yes, this line captures the paradox of divine energy expressed through human limitation. The dog has been joined by a tired child now, both sharing the same patch of shade. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how even exhaustion can become a kind of communion when it comes from giving oneself completely.
Notice how the poem moves from serving through depletion to radiance. This is pure Mari - showing how divine power often shines most clearly through human vulnerability. The evening light has turned everything gold now, transforming even fatigue into a kind of glory.
That final stanza about being both god and man speaks to what I\'ve learned watching life flow through these streets - how the sacred often reveals itself most clearly through embracing our limitations rather than transcending them. Each evening as I watch workers slowly make their way home, my heart remembers this wisdom: that true service often costs everything we have, yet somehow leaves us fuller than before.
## Both truths exist here
Human form bearing  \
Divine light still radiates\
Both truths exist here
mānuṣaṃ rūpaṃ dhṛtvā\
divyaṃ jyotiṃ prakāśati\
ubhayaṃ satyaṃ bhavati
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The last light paints the hotel towers gold while shadows deepen in the local barrio below - a perfect illustration of what Mari understood about simultaneous truths. This poem, especially in its Prakrit form, speaks to that essential mystery: mānuṣaṃ rūpaṃ dhṛtvā - \"bearing human form\" while containing divine light.
A blue butterfly has landed on my bougainvillea, its ordinary caterpillar origins transformed but still present in this more glorious form. The physical details in Mari\'s verse are characteristically precise: how Iesous\'s body would tire and hunger while his presence continued to transform everything around him. Through my winters here in Mexico, watching religious processions where the sacred and mundane dance together, I\'ve come to understand better what she witnessed.
\"Divine light still radiates\" - yes, this line holds the heart of the mystery. Like watching evening light transform humble street scenes into moments of unexpected grace, some truths exist simultaneously on multiple levels. The butterfly has been joined by a lizard now, each creature manifesting its nature perfectly. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how different levels of reality can coexist without contradiction.
Notice how both versions of the poem acknowledge the paradox without trying to resolve it. This is our Mari - showing how some truths must be held in balance rather than reconciled. A bee and the butterfly share space on the flower now, each complete in its own way of being, each allowing the other to share and be.
That final line about both truths existing speaks to what I\'ve learned watching life flow through these streets - how the sacred and ordinary often inhabit the same moment without diminishing each other. Each evening as I witness this dance of light and shadow, my heart remembers this wisdom: that reality is large enough to hold apparent contradictions in perfect harmony.
## PART 4
### Universal Vision
## Teaching poems about universal truth
The streets below have gone quiet now, but the sound of evening prayer-song mingles with children\'s distant laughter. This section of Mari\'s poems speaks to what she understood about universal truth - how wisdom transcends the artificial boundaries humans create. Through my winters here and summers in Japan, I\'ve witnessed what she describes - how truth reveals itself through different forms while maintaining its essential nature.
A firefly has appeared on my balcony, its light pulsing with that particular rhythm that seems both random and purposeful, as if in code. The physical details in these verses are characteristically grounded: how truth flows like water finding its own level, how love speaks through ordinary moments, how hearts meet beyond language barriers. Through watching life flow between my two homes, I\'ve learned what Mari knew - that wisdom often appears most clearly when we stop trying to contain it.
Notice how these poems move between cultures and traditions as naturally as the evening breeze carries both sea salt and cooking smoke to my terrace. Mari shows us how spiritual truth, like the moon reflected in different bodies of water, remains unchanged while appearing in countless forms.
A baby gecko pauses on my wall, its translucent skin revealing how blood flows through its body - another teaching about how truth becomes visible when we learn to see beneath surface differences. These poems carry Mari\'s deepest insight: that universal vision comes not through rejecting diversity but through seeing how it all works together in perfect harmony.
## This is the Way
Truth flows freely, \
Love speaks deeply,\
Hearts meet sweetly---\
This is the Way.
Through soul growing,\
Through mind flowing,\
Through heart knowing---\
Each finds their path.
From fear freeing,\
Through truth being,\
In love seeing---\
Heaven dwells here.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 Night deepens as I arrange my small altar, where Siddhartha Buddha sits comfortably beside Mother Mari, while copal smoke mingles with temple incense. This poem speaks to what Mari understood about truth\'s essential nature - how it flows freely when we stop trying to contain it in rigid forms. Through my winters here watching Catholic processions weave past ancient indigenous ceremonies, I\'ve witnessed what she described about how wisdom transcends our attempts to claim exclusive ownership of it.
The physical details reveal her insight: truth moving like water finding its own level, love speaking in a language deeper than words, hearts meeting in that space beyond doctrine. A moth circles my altar candle now, drawn to light without questioning its source. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how authentic seeking transcends all artificial boundaries.
\"Through soul growing\" - yes, this line captures the essential process. Like watching evening fog roll in from the bay, mixing with cooking smoke from street vendors\' grills, some truths refuse to stay separate. The moth has been joined by a gecko, both creatures sharing space in the candlelight without concern for categories.
Notice how the poem moves from free flowing through inner knowing to heaven\'s presence. This is pure Mari - showing how spiritual truth reveals itself most clearly when we stop trying to control it. The street sounds below have shifted to that particular quiet that comes when day\'s work is done, yet still holds whispers of life continuing.
That final stanza about heaven dwelling here speaks to what I\'ve learned through living between cultures - how truth refuses to be contained by any single tradition. Each evening as I watch different forms of devotion unfold in the streets below, my heart remembers this wisdom: that the Way reveals itself most clearly when we stop trying to own it.
## Within your heart
No priests needed,  \
No rules heeded,\
Just love seeded---\
Within your heart.
Through self turning,\
Through truth burning,\
Through spirit learning---\
Find heaven\'s gate.
From soul rising,\
Through love prizing,\
In truth realizing---\
God dwells in you.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The church bells have quieted now, but someone is singing beneath my window - not hymns but a 1950s love song that somehow carries its own kind of prayer. This poem speaks to what Mari understood about direct spiritual connection, how it needs no intermediary. The scent of jasmine rises from the courtyard, mixing with copal smoke from a nearby healing ceremony - different paths to the sacred, each valid in its own way.
An owl has appeared briefly on my railing, its presence both fierce and serene. The physical details in Mari\'s verse strike deep: how truth emerges not through ritual but through inner awakening, how love grows not from rules but from seeds planted in the heart\'s soil. Through my winters here, watching people find their own ways to the divine despite official doctrines, I\'ve witnessed what she described about authentic spirituality.
\"No priests needed\" - yes, this line carries the weight of lived truth. Like watching local healers work without ceremony or credential, some kinds of knowing flow directly from source to soul. The owl turns its head with that particular wisdom these creatures carry, watching the energy healing ceremony the priests stopped doing a millennia ago. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how true guidance often comes from unexpected sources.
Notice how the poem moves from rejection of external authority through inner turning to divine recognition. This is pure Mari - showing how spiritual truth reveals itself most clearly when we stop seeking it outside ourselves. A bat has spooked the owl and both off into the joy of night, each creature navigating darkness in its own perfect way.
That final stanza about God dwelling within speaks to what I\'ve learned watching life flow through these streets - how the sacred often reveals itself most clearly in unofficial moments, how the Church seems to tower over people, but they all have their own indigenous spirituality, so many are Wayists, but the church bells are part of the community. Each night as I witness different forms of devotion unfold below my balcony, my heart remembers this wisdom: that true spirituality needs no external validation.
## All souls matter
All souls matter,  \
No walls shatter,\
Love rays scatter---\
Light touches all.
Through bounds breaking,\
Through hearts waking,\
Through love making---\
We\'re all one path.
From truth flowing,\
Through grace showing,\
In light growing---\
Each soul finds home.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 Here in the warm air of the barrio, the night has grown deep but the street still pulses with life - stray dogs sharing scraps with cats, tired workers making their way home, loud love music shared with all from slow moving vehicles, young lovers seeking shadows. This poem speaks to what Mari understood about the fundamental equality of all beings. Through my winters here and summers in Japan, I\'ve seen how wisdom dissolves the artificial hierarchies humans create.
A large fruit bat swoops past my balcony, sharing air space with moths near my porch light. The physical details in Mari\'s verse are characteristically inclusive: how love touches all beings without discrimination, how hearts awaken regardless of status, how truth flows wherever it finds opening. Through watching life unfold in these streets, I\'ve witnessed what she described about the essential dignity of every soul.
\"Through bounds breaking\" - yes, this line captures the necessary dissolution of barriers. Like watching the evening gathering in the plaza where social classes briefly blur, some truths emerge only when we stop sorting beings into categories of worth. The bat and moths dance their shared choreography of survival, the street dogs and stray cats share space with a toddler who escaped dad's attention and now sits in the puddle at the front door, and one of the dogs linger close by keeping an eye on the kid just in case it makes a move into the street. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how nature ignores our human hierarchies.
Notice how the poem moves from universal value through unity to homecoming. This is pure Mari - showing how spiritual truth embraces all while rejecting none. A street dog has paused below, sharing it's found bread with smaller creatures, purposely not eating everything and letting them, offering me another lesson about natural generosity.
That final stanza about each soul finding home speaks to what I\'ve learned through living between worlds - how the sacred reveals itself through every form of being. Each night as I watch this dance of mutual belonging unfold below, my heart remembers this wisdom: that divine love makes no distinctions in its embrace.
## Look deep within
Mind-gates opening,  \
Soul-depths softening,\
Truth-light offering---\
Look deep within.
Through heart reading,\
Through love seeding,\
Through truth heeding---\
Wisdom grows clear.
From self knowing,\
Through light flowing,\
In truth growing---\
Find heaven here.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The city has grown quiet now except for the eternal voice of the sea. Even the basketball court below holds only shadows and memory, no lights, only lovers whisper and giggle. This poem speaks to what Mari understood about inner knowing - how wisdom waits in our depths if we dare to look. From my balcony, I watch the last vendors pack their carts, their bodies dead-tired, their songs melancholic, movements carrying that bone-deep wisdom that comes from living close to life\'s essential rhythms.
A luna moth has appeared, drawn to my small altar light. The physical details in Mari\'s verse reveal her understanding: how truth emerges when mind-gates soften, how wisdom grows in the heart\'s fertile soil, how light dwells in our deepest places. Through my nights here watching the interplay of darkness and illumination, I\'ve witnessed what she described about inner awakening.
\"Through heart reading\" - yes, this line carries the essence of authentic knowing. Like watching the old women who sell herbs in the market, some kinds of understanding come only through patient attention to what lies beneath surface appearance. The moth rests now, its wings catching altar light like living stained glass. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how beauty reveals itself to those who learn to look with the heart\'s eye.
Notice how the poem moves from opening through seeding to finding heaven within. This is pure Mari - showing how spiritual truth often reveals itself in reverse of what we expect. A spider has begun weaving between my altar candles, its work both practical and profound, I take care to honor her dedication to The Way, were in it together.
That final stanza about finding heaven here speaks to what I\'ve learned through nights of contemplation above these streets - how the divine often dwells closest when we stop seeking it elsewhere. Each night as I witness this dance of light and shadow, my heart remembers this wisdom: that our deepest truth lives in that quiet space within.
## Series about universal consciousness
## All life is one
Grass blade bending,  \
Life force lending,\
Soul-light sending---\
All life is one.
Through sap flowing,\
Through leaf knowing,\
Through love growing---\
Plants feel and know.
From Earth rising,\
Through light prizing,\
In truth realizing---\
Green wisdom speaks.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The ocean breeze carries salt and jasmine now, while beneath my balcony the plants in doña Maria\'s garden stir with their own kind of consciousness, especially that fat one who looks like she belongs in a desert but is happy here near the coast. This poem speaks to what Mari understood about the living awareness which flows through all beings. Through my winters here watching the intimate dance between hummingbirds and flowers, I\'ve witnessed what she described about nature\'s subtle intelligence.
A night-blooming cereus has opened on my terrace, its fragrance attracting moths and memories alike. The physical details in Mari\'s verse strike deep: how life force moves through blade of grass and human heart alike, how sap and blood carry similar wisdom, how green things know things we\'ve forgotten. Through observing life\'s rhythms in two hemispheres, I\'ve learned what she meant about the consciousness that connects all beings.
\"Through leaf knowing\" - yes, this line captures that essential truth about plant wisdom. The cereus blooms just once, yet holds perfect knowledge of its timing. A bat approaches now, drawn to the flower\'s nocturnal offering but denies me the pleasure to see it. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how life choreographs its endless dance of mutual sustenance.
Notice how the poem moves from recognition through connection to revelation. This is pure Mari - showing how wisdom often speaks through what we consider simplest. The bat and flower perform their ancient partnership, each knowing exactly what the other needs.
That final stanza about green wisdom speaks to what I\'ve learned through nights of watching life unfold on this mountain slope - how intelligence flows through forms we often overlook. Each night as I witness these small miracles of mutual knowing, my heart remembers this wisdom: that consciousness speaks through every living thing.
## They know love true
Dog-heart beating,  \
Cat-mind meeting,\
Bird-soul greeting---\
They know love true.
Through eyes seeing,\
Through hearts being,\
Through souls freeing---\
They teach us ways.
From love giving,\
Through joy living,\
In truth thriving---\
Our teachers all.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 From my terrace I watch over my typewriter a mother cat leading her kittens through the shadows below, their movements a lesson in natural grace. This poem speaks to what Mari understood about animal wisdom - how our four-legged teachers often demonstrate love\'s truths more clearly than humans. Through my winters here and summers in Japan, I\'ve witnessed this same teaching through different creatures but with identical heart.
A street dog has paused in its rounds to allow a smaller companion its leftovers, which it looks back at to make sure it is eaten and not wasted. Rats and pigeons share the same food the abuela drops for them. The physical details in Mari\'s verse illuminate these everyday miracles: how animals show love without condition, how they forgive without hesitation, how they teach without knowing they are teachers and are not certified for it. Through watching these street creatures form their complex communities, I\'ve seen what she meant about love\'s natural expression.
\"Through hearts being\" - yes, this line captures the essence of animal wisdom. Like watching the market cats in Japan or the street dogs here, some kinds of knowing flow more purely when uncluttered by human complexity. The two dogs below have been joined by others now, each finding its place in their informal family. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how love creates its own kind of order.
Notice how the poem moves from recognition through demonstration to learning. This is pure Mari - showing how wisdom often comes through observing what we consider lesser beings. The dogs have settled into their nighttime ritual of mutual grooming, offering another lesson about care without condition. I don't come here as a Wayist teacher, I come for a Wayist retreat presented by the street animals, the wiser of Wayists in the area.
That final stanza about our teachers speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of watching animals navigate their worlds - how they often demonstrate spiritual truths more clearly than our most elevated philosophies. Each night as I witness these small acts of natural grace, my heart remembers this wisdom: that love\'s truest teachers often walk on four legs or fly on silent wings.
## Small wisdom flows
Ant-minds working,  \
Bee-souls stirring,\
Life-force merging---\
Small wisdom flows.
Through tasks tending,\
Through love lending,\
Through life sending---\
They share one light.
From truth growing,\
Through life showing,\
In love flowing---\
All souls have worth.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 A line of leaf-cutter ants crosses my terrace tiles, their coordinated effort transforming the night into a lesson about collective purpose. This poem speaks to what Mari understood about the profound wisdom carried by our smallest neighbors. Through watching similar processions - ants in Mexico, honey bees in Japan - I\'ve witnessed what she described about intelligence that flows through all life.
The ants move with that particular certainty these creatures possess, each one knowing its role without question. The physical details in Mari\'s verse reveal her careful attention: how tiny minds coordinate complex tasks, how individual purpose serves collective good, how life force manifests in even the smallest beings. A gecko watches the ant procession now, its own hunting patience offering another lesson in natural wisdom.
\"Through tasks tending\" - yes, this line captures the sacred in the seemingly mundane. Like watching the bees that visit my morning market stall in Japan, some kinds of knowing emerge through perfect attention to ordinary work. The ants have formed a living bridge now to cross a gap in their path. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how wisdom often works through collective rather than individual intelligence.
Notice how the poem moves from working through merging to recognition of worth. This is pure Mari - showing how spiritual truth reveals itself through what we often overlook. The gecko has decided, wisely I think, to leave the ants to their work, each creature respecting the other\'s purpose -- hunting to eat only.
That final stanza about all souls having worth speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of watching these small miracles unfold - how wisdom flows through every form of being. Each night as I witness these tiny demonstrations of life\'s intelligence, my heart remembers this truth: that consciousness knows no hierarchy of value.
## Water lives deep
Wave-thoughts moving,  \
Stream-mind proving,\
Lake-soul soothing---\
Water lives deep.
Through flow teaching,\
Through life reaching,\
Through love speaking---\
It knows all paths.
From source springing,\
Through life bringing,\
In truth singing---\
Water holds souls.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 The sound of waves reaches my terrace even now, their eternal rhythm a counterpoint to the city\'s diminishing noise. This poem speaks to what Mari understood about water\'s wisdom - how it teaches through its very nature. From my vantage point between mountain and sea, watching water move from cloud to river to ocean, I\'ve witnessed what she described about this element\'s profound intelligence.
Humidity beads on my skin like thoughts condensing into understanding. The physical details in Mari\'s verse flow like water itself: how waves carry ancient memory, how streams find their way without maps, how still pools hold depths of knowing. Through observing water\'s different forms in two hemispheres, I\'ve learned what she meant about its teaching presence.
\"Through flow teaching\" - yes, this line captures water\'s essential wisdom. Like watching evening fog roll in from Banderas Bay, some kinds of knowledge move through us rather than being grasped. A few drops have fallen from my plants onto the spider\'s web below, each droplet catching moonlight like a separate star. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how wisdom often comes through letting go rather than holding on.
Notice how the poem moves from movement through reaching to singing. This is pure Mari - showing how spiritual truth often mirrors water\'s way of finding its own level. The drops in the web have attracted a moth, drawn to their small galaxies of light.
That final stanza about water holding souls speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of witnessing water\'s endless transformations - how it carries life\'s deepest mysteries in its flow, how it transports those mysteries through veins, brains, fogs, monsoons, ice and beer. Each night as I listen to the waves below, my heart remembers this wisdom: that water teaches us everything we need to know about both holding on and letting go.
## None stands alone
Life-web weaving,  \
All souls breathing,\
Truth perceiving---\
None stands alone.
Through love binding,\
Through life finding,\
Through truth winding---\
All share one light.
From Earth growing,\
Through love flowing,\
In truth knowing---\
All souls are one.
*\~ Mother Mari of Magadha*
 Night has fully embraced the mountain now, yet life\'s web remains visible to those who know how to look. This poem speaks to what Mari understood about the profound interconnection of all beings. A bat swoops past my terrace, following invisible paths of echolocation, while below the night-blooming jasmine releases its fragrance - each being completing the other\'s purpose.
The physical details in Mari\'s verse reveal this dance of mutual belonging: how life weaves its countless threads into one fabric, how each breath connects us to all other breathers, how even seeming separation serves connection. Through my years of watching life\'s patterns unfold in two hemispheres, I\'ve witnessed what she described about creation\'s essential unity.
\"Through love binding\" - yes, this line captures the heart of interconnection. Like watching the invisible partnerships between flower and pollinator, some kinds of relationship exist beyond our ordinary seeing. The bat returns now, drawn into the ancient partnership of nectar and flight. Mari would have seen this as another teaching about how we serve each other even when we don\'t know we\'re doing so.
That final stanza about all souls being one speaks to what I\'ve learned through years of witnessing life\'s intricate dance - how even apparent separation serves unity\'s deeper purpose. At times I watch this web of relationship unfold below my terrace, my heart remembers this wisdom: that none of us truly stands alone, that every being completes every other being\'s story.
The night grows deep now, and with it comes that particular silence that invites reflection. Like Mari\'s verses themselves, it reminds us that wisdom often speaks most clearly when we grow quiet enough to listen. Through these poems, she shows us how truth reveals itself most purely when we learn to see with the heart\'s eye - recognizing our essential unity with all that lives.
## Closing Thoughts
The night has grown that very quiet now, that quiet we say is the "still of night". So here in the eternal voice of the sea which makes our white noise and the gentle hum of Earth\'s sustaining frequency, my spirit-self leisures in that energy glow as if in a luxurious onsen. I look over the last pages of the manuscript these poems and memories created, a moth spirals around my altar candle, reminding me of what Mari understood how wisdom often comes through indirect paths. Through arranging these verses between my winter home here in Mexico and my summer market stall in Japan, I\'ve come to understand more deeply what she taught about truth revealing itself through ordinary moments.
These poems carry Mari\'s essential insight: that spiritual wisdom flows through our complete human experience, not despite it. From the fish blood and biome life on my cutting board to the evening blessing of street vendors\' cooking smoke, from the precise movements of market cats to the graceful partnership of bat and night-blooming flower - every moment offers its own kind of teaching if we learn to pay attention.
Mari\'s journey from the wealthy home with servants to brothels of Srinagar to her place as one of humanity\'s greatest spiritual teachers shows us something profound about transformation. Like the lotus flowers I sometimes get tangled in my fishing nets, wisdom often grows strongest in places others consider chaos or unclean. Her verses remind us that light enters through our broken places, that every experience, even the most painful, can become a gateway to deeper understanding.
Geraldo the gecko pauses on my wall now, winking at me, its translucent skin revealing how blood moves through its body - another teaching about how truth becomes visible when we learn to see beneath surface appearances. This is what Mari taught: that wisdom reveals itself not through rejecting any part of our experience but through bringing full presence to every moment.
The poems in this collection are by no means all of Mother Mari's poems, just the one's I happened to choose for this collection of musings. Each poem carries its own particular medicine, yet together they weave something larger - a vision of how spirit works through flesh, how divine love transforms everything it touches, how every being participates in the sacred dance of existence -- how spiritual excellence can pass us by if we are not mindful. Through her words, we learn to find heaven not by escaping our humanity but by fully embracing it.
Geraldo has been joined by the moth now, each creature perfectly expressing its nature while sharing the same small space. The light attracting both, and we each find our own reason why, but were all attracted to the Light. Some ignore it, some try to force it, some try to buy it. Like Mari\'s verses themselves, they remind us that truth often speaks most clearly when we stop trying to separate the sacred from the ordinary.
As I close this collection, the first hint of dawn touches the eastern sky. I will have finished this manuscript and be on the patio cuddling up to a warm cup of coffee when the sun rises -- my eyes bloodshot, brain tired, body sore from days in the same position -- but rejuvenated from having walked with Mother Mari this road and I am delighted to know you too will go down this way with her. She is so amazing! Mari would say it doesn\'t matter when - wisdom reveals itself wherever we are, whenever were ready, if only we learn to look with the heart\'s eye.
In the end, these poems teach us what Mari learned through her extraordinary journey - that every moment carries its own kind of holiness, that every being holds its own kind of light, that love transforms everything it touches into something sacred. May her words continue to illuminate the path for all who seek to understand how heaven and earth dance together in perfect harmony.
*\~Kaori Mizuki Puerto Vallarta, Winter 2025*
## About the Author
Kaori Mizuki (瑶月) lives in a small house near Kamakura\'s fish market, where she has worked as a vendor for over forty years. Each morning before dawn, she can be found at her stall, carefully arranging the day\'s catch while observing the delicate interplay between commerce and compassion that characterizes market life. Her writings emerge from this intersection of the practical and profound, finding spiritual truth in the most ordinary moments.
Born to a fishing family in post-war Japan, Kaori learned early to read both fish and human nature. Her formal education was limited, but her real learning has come through decades of careful attention to how wisdom manifests in everyday life. She began writing after encountering the teachings of Lord Iesous and Mari of Magadha through traveling merchants, recognizing in their words the same truth she found in the rhythms of market life.
While primarily known as a teacher of Wayist philosophy, Kaori\'s influence extends beyond religious boundaries. Her commentaries on Mari\'s poems are particularly valued for their ability to illuminate spiritual truths through physical reality. She has a gift for finding profound meaning in what others might consider mundane or even unseemly - the smell of fish blood at dawn, the particular ache of aging joints, the way dying fish eyes reflect truth about impermanence.
A stubborn ume tree grows in her small garden, and a family of cats has adopted both her and her market stall. She continues to work, write, and teach, and during winter months works from her little place in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. She maintains that wisdom comes not from escaping our ordinary human experience but through paying closer attention to it. Her students often note how she can shift seamlessly between discussing the price of mackerel and the nature of divine love, seeing no contradiction between the two.
Kaori\'s writings, like her market work, focus on finding what is fresh and true, trimming away what is spoiled or false. She approaches both tasks with the same careful attention, treating fish and wisdom with equal respect. When asked about her unusual combination of occupations, she often quotes Mari: \"Truth speaks clearest through unwashed fingers.\"
Her previous works include \"The Fishmonger\'s Commentary on the Teaching of the Way\" and \"Market Meditations: Finding Truth in Ordinary Things.\" This current volume represents decades of living with Mari\'s poems, finding in them layers of meaning that only reveal themselves through patient attention - much like the sea itself, which offers different gifts to those who know how to look and wait.
A small shrine in the corner of her stall holds a picture of Mari and a bowl of fresh water for stray cats. Each morning, she offers both fresh fish and fresh insights to those who stop by. \"The cats,\" she says, \"are often better teachers than I am. They know what\'s truly fresh.
