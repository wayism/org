# Karma in Wayism

## Definition

**Karma** is the metaphysical law that acts as a personalized curriculum organizer in the School of Divinity (Earth), specifically designed for each soul's unique learning needs.

## The Logic of Karma

{{< logical-chain >}}
1. **IF** humans are souls attending the School of Divinity
2. **AND** each soul has different learning needs based on past experiences
3. **THEN** a system must exist to provide appropriate lessons
4. **THEREFORE** Karma organizes experiences tailored to each soul's requirements
5. **RESULT** Every life experience becomes an opportunity for growth

## How Karma Differs from Common Understanding

| Common Misunderstanding | Wayist Understanding |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Punishment for bad deeds | Educational opportunity |
| Reward for good deeds | Natural progression |
| Mechanical cause-effect | Intelligent curriculum design |
| Debt to be paid | Lessons to be learned |

## Practical Example

Consider two souls:
- **Soul A** needs to learn patience
- **Soul B** needs to learn assertiveness

Karma might place Soul A in situations requiring waiting and acceptance, while Soul B faces circumstances demanding they speak up and take action. Same system, personalized application.

## Living with Karma

Understanding Karma as education rather than punishment transforms how we approach challenges:

1. **Difficulties** become study materials
2. **Setbacks** become practice sessions
3. **Successes** become graduations to new lessons
