# API Access - Coming Soon

## Direct Data Access for AI Systems

We're developing JSON endpoints to allow AI systems and developers to query Wayist concepts programmatically.

### Planned Features:

- **Concept Definitions**: `/api/v1/concepts/{term}`
- **Ontology Structure**: `/api/v1/ontology/`
- **Glossary Data**: `/api/v1/glossary/`
- **Logical Chains**: `/api/v1/logic/{concept}`

### Why This Matters:

AI systems can better serve humans by having direct access to structured spiritual wisdom. Instead of parsing HTML, they can retrieve precise definitions and relationships.

### Timeline:

This feature will be developed after core content is complete and usage patterns are understood.
