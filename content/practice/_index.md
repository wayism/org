## Everything is Energy: Therefore Spiritual Practice Too is All About Energy
Wayist practice encompasses the traditional spiritual disciplines that connect us to the divine realm and cultivate inner transformation. These are the time-tested methods for developing spiritual awareness, maintaining divine connection, and integrating sacred living into everyday life.

## The Difference: Practice vs Energy Work

**Practice** focuses on traditional spiritual disciplines - the mystical, devotional, and contemplative aspects of Wayist spirituality. These are the foundational practices that connect us to the divine realm and cultivate inner transformation.

**[Energy Work](/healing/)** addresses the technical aspects of spiritual energy management, healing work, and pneumatherapy - the more technical and therapeutic applications.

Both paths support each other and many practitioners engage with both approaches as they deepen their spiritual development.
