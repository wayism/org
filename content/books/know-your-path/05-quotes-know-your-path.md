## On Authentic Spiritual Authority

> "The identities of Salvar Dàosenglu are less important than the message, which speaks for itself."

> "If a message is said by a famous person, the soul-people tell you that is more believable, and they will most likely follow the teaching. But that is only temporary."

> "Soul-people default to pedestalizing people, build them up high, then sabotage the pedestal and watch them fall and get trampled and ruined. It is a social sport for soul-people."

> "If a Mountain Hare in the woods, or a simpleton on a park bench tells you their philosophy and your spirit jumps at it, and cannot shed it, and keeps returning you to the topic and you see how it explains the fundamental questions of life, perhaps you should accept the message for what it is, regardless of who delivered it."

## On Path Recognition

> "If not on the Path of authenticity, joy, peace, and wholesomeness, where are you heading?"

> "The teachings that flow from the pen of Salvar Dàosenglu either speak your truth, or it does not."

> "For most who encounter teachings of theWAY, it grows, and soon is seen as a precious gift to humanity, a beacon of hope and guidance in a world that is all too often shrouded in darkness and confusion."

> "Those drawn to Wayist teaching are ancient souls who have crossed this path before. You would not be reading this if you weren't ready."

## On Spiritual Development

> "But the teachings of theWAY are far more than a set of abstract ideas or intellectual constructs. Rather, they are a living invitation to transformation, a call to embark upon the greatest adventure of our lives: the journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening."

> "One must be able to read at this level, and read in a language in which Wayist tradition is a written teaching, and one must be able to afford the books, and, and this is the big one, one must be open-minded enough for the book to get into your hands, somehow. It is a rare privilege. Millions of way walkers go without."

> "This direct encounter with truth is the very essence of the higher spiritual path. It is a path that begins with a spark of recognition, a moment of profound resonance when the teachings of the Wayist tradition first touch the depths of our being."

## On Ancient Soul Awakening

> "In that moment, something stirs within us, a long-forgotten memory of our own inherent wisdom and perfection. We may not yet understand the full import of what we have encountered, but we know in our bones that we have stumbled upon something precious, something that will change our lives forever."

> "You have crossed its path before; you are an ancient soul and would not be reading this if you weren't. And each time, you embrace more, and appreciate more of the inner teachings. It is again presented to you by your Divine Guide and your karma."

> "As you explore these teachings, you may find yourself nodding in recognition, a deep sense of resonance stirring within your ancient soul."

## On Transformation Process

> "As we walk the path of the Cognitive Wayist, we begin to experience a profound shift in our perception and understanding. The old ways of seeing and being, the habits and patterns that have kept us trapped in cycles of suffering and limitation, start to fall away like leaves in the autumn wind."

> "In their place, a new way of being emerges, a way that is rooted in presence and awareness, in the direct experience of the present moment."

> "We start to see the world with fresh eyes, to encounter each moment as a new and wondrous creation, suffused with the light of the divine."

## On Spiritual Community

> "And so we seek out the company of other Wayists, other travelers on the path of awakening. We join together in community, in sacred circles of support and inspiration, sharing our insights and our struggles, our joys and our sorrows."

> "In these circles, we find a deep sense of belonging and connection, a refuge from the storms of the world and a sanctuary for the nourishment of our souls."

> "We laugh and cry together, dance and sing together, meditate and pray together, all in service of the great work of awakening that we have undertaken."

## From Lord Jesus (Quintessential Teacher of theWAY)

> "Let one who seeks not stop seeking until they find; and upon finding, they will be disturbed; and being disturbed, will be astounded; and will reign over their mortality."

## On Sacred Trust

> "For the monks of Salvar Dàosenglu, the restoration of the Wayist teachings is a sacred trust, a spiritual imperative that carries the weight of destiny itself."

> "They know that the wisdom they have unearthed is not a relic of a bygone age, but a living stream of truth that has the power to transform lives and awaken hearts in the here and now."

## On Spiritual Archaeology

> "The monks of Salvar Dàosenglu have undertaken a monumental task of spiritual archaeology, sifting through the sands of time to uncover the hidden gems of Wayist wisdom that have been obscured by the winds of change and the tides of history."

> "With meticulous care and an unwavering commitment to authenticity, they have sought out the earliest and most reliable sources of Wayist teaching, the ancient texts and oral traditions that carry the living flame of enlightenment from generation to generation."

## On Living Truth

> "The wisdom they have unearthed is not a relic of a bygone age, but a living stream of truth that has the power to transform lives and awaken hearts in the here and now."

> "Though the journey may be long and the challenges many, we know in our hearts that it is the only path worth walking, the only joyous and meaningful adventure that truly matters."

> "For in the end, it is the path that leads us to the very heart of our own being, to the place where all paths converge and all seeking comes to rest."
