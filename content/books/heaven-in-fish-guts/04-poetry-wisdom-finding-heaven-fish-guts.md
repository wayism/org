*Concentrated wisdom through verse and reflection*

## On Divine Presence in Ordinary Moments

> "In the markets of Kamakura and Puerto Vallarta, between fish scales and morning light, wisdom speaks through unwashed fingers and aching joints."

> "These are not metaphors for truth but truth itself, speaking through flesh and bone and daily necessity."

> "A gecko's attention contains as much wisdom as any sutra. The way morning light catches on fish scales can reveal more about reality than abstract philosophy."

*blade parts fish flesh*  
*while gut holds universe whole ---*  
*one life flows through all*

*(what viscera teach:)*  
*truth lives in hidden places*

## The Spider's Teaching

> "A spider watches from her web between my ice bins, perhaps recognizing something familiar in how carefully I navigate around vital organs."

> "The spider above us catches a moth, beginning her own work of transformation."

> "My hands continue their careful dance of transformation, showing rather than telling how every stage carries its own beauty."

*spider reads morning's truth*  
*while child touches fish scales ---*  
*aversion melts here*

*(what flesh teaches now:)*  
*beauty flows through honest sight*

## On Authentic vs. Artificial

> "See this?" I show her how the otoro's fat marbling catches light like rose quartz."

> "Her mother's resistance softens slightly, something in her own body remembering wisdom it held before culture taught it what to reject."

> "It's just so... raw," a young woman says, watching me work."

> "See how the flesh parts perfectly here? The body tells us exactly how it wants to be handled, if we learn to listen."

## Finding Sacred in Mundane Work

> "The first cut releases that particular scent that rises when interior meets exterior — not the unpleasant smell others wrinkle their noses at, but the honest breath of what usually remains hidden."

> "Here in my hands writhes an ecosystem of microscopic life, billions of beings living and dying and transforming each other in endless cycles of becoming."

> "Each internal organ a testimony to how energy flows through all things, taking different forms but never truly separated."

*fish scales tell tales*  
*fingers read what books can't teach -*  
*wisdom lives in flesh*

## On the Nature of Wisdom

> "Wisdom is what remains after the tide of facts and figures recedes. It's what settles in our bones after experience has been digested by time and reflection."

> "I think of my fish market teacher, how she could look at a fish and read its whole journey — where it was caught, how long it had traveled, whether it died in fear or peace."

> "That wasn't knowledge she could have downloaded or learned from books. It was wisdom earned through years of attention."

> "Perhaps wisdom is just learning to be as honest as a fresh fish on ice — completely itself, hiding nothing, offering its truth to anyone who knows how to read it."

*Running fingers along a fish's spine, feeling the truth that lives beneath words*

## Divine Energy and Universal Connection

> "The same divine energy that spins galaxies moves through these tiny organisms, speaking through their cellular wisdom."

> "Not so different, really, from the bacteria teeming in the intestinal tract, or the cells in my own hands that know exactly how to grip a knife."

> "All of us reading from the same profound script written in the language of shared energy."

> "My fingers find the tiny sparks of roe hiding beneath other organs — future lives held in perfect suspension, each egg carrying complete instructions for becoming."

## On Raw Truth and Honest Living

> "It's all so... messy," a girl comments, watching me clean a particularly large fish."

> "Her question carries that particular anxiety some people feel about raw food, about unmediated encounter with what will become part of their own flesh."

> "The word catches in her throat — not just about the fish but about something deeper, some resistance to life's fundamental nature."

> "An elderly man brings his grandson, specifically asking me to show the boy what he calls 'real things.'"

*child touches fish scales*  
*while spider reads morning's truth ---*  
*aversion melts here*

## Contemplative Attention and Presence

> "My blade moves with the same delicate attention a surgeon might use, seeking the space just beside the green-gold sac of bile."

> "One wrong move would release bitterness that would taint everything, teaching us how some boundaries must be respected."

> "His small fingers discover what his eyes couldn't tell him — how each scale fits perfectly with its neighbors."

> "Feel how the scales all point one way."

## The Privilege of Awareness

> "These essays emerge from decades of market work and observation, from learning to read both fish freshness and human nature."

> "Like fish, some offerings are best received directly, without the intermediary of too much preparation."

> "Wisdom lives precisely in these overlooked spaces — in the way blood patterns form on cutting boards."

> "Even our bodies' small rebellions — running noses, aching joints, unexpected tears — carry messages about how truth moves through human experience."

## Universal Spiritual Teaching

> "TheWAY teaches us that divine energy flows through all things, not despite their physical nature but because of it."

> "Some might question why a fish vendor concerns herself with spiritual matters, or why divine truth should speak through mundane details of market life."

> "But wisdom lives precisely in these overlooked spaces."

> "These writings attempt to present wisdom as immediately as possible — through physical detail, through bodily experience."

*what viscera teach:*  
*truth lives in hidden places*  
*— blade parts fish flesh*

## Integration of Sacred and Ordinary

> "Watch, see how perfectly she wraps her food, how nothing is wasted, how every movement serves life's continuation."

> "The woman's disgust slowly shifts to fascination as she recognizes something fundamental about how energy moves from form to form."

> "See how the joint articulates, how the membrane holds everything in perfect relation, how even the organs he'd rather not acknowledge carry their own kind of grace."

> "Something in him recognizing that his craft is incomplete without this understanding."

## The Dance of Life and Death

> "Here, I guide her attention to the natural seams where muscle meets muscle."

> "His eyes keep returning to my work, something in him recognizing that his craft is incomplete without this understanding."

> "Watch how even death feeds life's endless dance."

> "My hands continue their careful work, letting the fish demonstrate what my words might fail to explain."

*spider catches moth*  
*beginning transformation work -*  
*nothing here is waste*
