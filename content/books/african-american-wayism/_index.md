# African American Wayism
## Returning to Wholeness - a lifestyle, philosophy and spirituality

*By Mabel Thomson (1940-2024)*

**"When I discovered our people's ancient ways, it wasn't like learning something new. It was like remembering something I always knew."**  
— Mabel Thomson, Community Healer

Welcome to a profound journey of spiritual homecoming. **African American Wayism** offers a revolutionary approach to spirituality that honors African heritage while teaching universal Wayist principles — not as a rejection of your current path, but as a deepening of it through cultural wisdom that runs in your bloodline.

## The Call to Remember

You've found your way to these pages for a reason. Perhaps you've been searching for a spiritual path that resonates with your deepest self while honoring your heritage as a person of African descent living in America. Perhaps you're raising children and seeking wisdom to guide them in a world that often works against their highest development. Or perhaps you simply sense there must be more to life than what mainstream culture offers — a deeper connection, a more authentic way of being, a true sense of purpose.

Whatever brought you here, know this: You are not beginning a journey, but returning to one. This wisdom isn't foreign to your soul — it represents the rekindling of ancient knowing that predates the disruptions of slavery, colonization, and enforced religious conversion.

## Mabel Thomson's Spiritual Authority

Mabel Thomson, a Wayist healer known for her world travels and seminars, grew up in Harlem, lived in Costa Rica, and spent her final years based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Her "Spiritual Homecoming" collection addresses the specific spiritual needs of African Americans seeking authentic post-institutional spirituality while remaining grounded in universal Wayist principles.

Her approach demonstrates how profound spiritual wisdom emerges through culturally specific experience — finding the sacred in cornbread recipes that connect across oceans, in hair that wears its natural crown without apology, in laughter that serves as medicine and resistance, in hands that remember soil like Scripture.

## What Makes This Unique

**Cultural Reclamation Without Separation:** This isn't about reinforcing division but about acknowledging that authentic spiritual growth happens most powerfully when we honor the wisdom of our current embodiment while remembering our eternal nature.

**Ancestral Wisdom Integration:** The book traces how fundamental Wayist principles were expressed in traditional African understandings long before they were given other names, providing pathway for reconnecting with disrupted spiritual practices while honoring the journey that brought us to this moment.

**Contemporary Relevance:** Addresses specific challenges facing African American families — materialism pressures, identity navigation, cultural pride within universal spiritual understanding — while serving broader spiritual development.

**Jesus as Wayist Teacher:** Reveals how Lord Jesus taught Wayism, not Christianity, connecting African American Christian heritage with ancient Wayist wisdom and African spiritual traditions.

## Who This Serves

**African Diaspora Members** seeking authentic spirituality that honors cultural heritage while teaching universal spiritual principles.

**Families** raising conscious children in contemporary American society while maintaining cultural identity and spiritual development.

**Spiritual Seekers** moving beyond institutional religion toward post-institutional spirituality grounded in ancestral wisdom.

**Anyone** seeking contemplative approach to spirituality that finds profound wisdom through culturally specific experience rather than generic spiritual concepts.

## The Framework Offered

**Family Spiritual Development:** Practical approaches for creating spiritual households, raising conscious children, and healing generational patterns within contemporary cultural challenges.

**A Message from Mabel:**  
*"May your ancestors rejoice as you reclaim the wisdom they preserved. May your daily choices reflect the divine potential you carry. May your journey on the Wayist path bring you ever closer to the truth of who you are becoming — An immortal divine being. A soul becoming spirit through the sacred classroom of Earth."*
