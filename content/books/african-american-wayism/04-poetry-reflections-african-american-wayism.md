## Mabel Thomson's Cultural Wisdom Expressions

Mabel Thomson's contemplative poetry demonstrates how profound spiritual wisdom emerges through ordinary African American cultural experiences. Her approach finds the sacred in cornbread recipes, natural hair, community laughter, and ancestral memories — showing how culturally specific experiences serve as vehicles for universal spiritual understanding.

## On Ancestral Memory and Cultural Connection

**MAIZE MEMORIES**
> *The first time I visited West Africa I woke to women grinding corn singing low and steady in languages I couldn't understand with my mind but my body knew the rhythm*
> 
> *Something in me remembered the press of stone against grain the cadence of women working together the promise of porridge simmering*
> 
> *Back home, I make cornbread the way my mama taught me and with each stir, I'm building a bridge across oceans*
> 
> *When we gather around the table passing the golden squares hand to hand it's communion more honest than any church wafer*

This poem demonstrates how food preparation becomes spiritual practice connecting across generations and oceans, transforming ordinary kitchen activities into sacred cultural transmission.

## On Natural Beauty and Authenticity

**CROWNING GLORY**
> *They told me to tame it straighten it hide it pull it back make it "professional" while their daughters paid money for curls and volume and thickness and coils*
> 
> *I spent decades apologizing for what grows naturally from my scalp until the day I understood my crown was never meant to be hidden*
> 
> *Now I wear my hair the way sun wears its rays the way trees wear their branches the way stars wear their light*
> 
> *And my niece watches me learning that her beauty needs no permission*

Hair becomes metaphor for authentic self-expression and cultural pride, demonstrating how personal choices about appearance serve spiritual development and cultural healing.

## On Spiritual Authority and Identity

**WAYIST WOMAN**
> *I am not what they expect This Black woman with African wisdom and ancient knowing in her bones*
> 
> *I confuse them when I speak of chakras and energy and Jesus the Wayist when I bow to the sun instead of kneeling at an altar when I call God Mother as often as Father*
> 
> *I am what my great-grandmother would have been before they took her gods and gave her a book*
> 
> *When I meditate I feel them smiling as I find my way back to what they always knew*

This reflection explores the intersection of African American identity with universal spiritual practice, showing how cultural reclamation serves both individual and ancestral healing.

## On Earth Connection and Ancestral Wisdom

**EARTHBOUND**
> *My grandmama's hands knew soil like they knew Scripture — intimately, reverently, daily.*
> 
> *Those hands pulled sustenance from ground that white folks said was barren, found medicine in weeds they called worthless.*
> 
> *When I dig my hands into garden dirt now, generations reach through me, my DNA singing harmony with soil that remembers our bodies long before we were called American*
> 
> *This is my church — sun on my shoulders, soil in my fingerprints, ancestors in my movements.*

Gardening and earth connection become spiritual practices that honor ancestral wisdom and natural world relationship as fundamental spiritual education.

## On Community and Cultural Healing

**LAUGHTER MEDICINE**
> *I've watched white folks hold back laughter like it costs them something shoulders tight lips pressed joy contained measured out in careful portions*
> 
> *While in my mama's kitchen laughter bubbles up uncontrollable as spring water*
> 
> *We laugh to keep from crying we laugh to remember who we are we laugh as resistance we laugh as medicine*
> 
> *This is wealth they can't measure this is power they can't take this is heritage worth keeping*

Laughter becomes recognized as cultural medicine and spiritual practice that serves both individual healing and community resilience.

## On Spiritual Reclamation and Breaking Chains

> *My children watch me breaking the chains of religions that never served us*
> 
> *My daughter asks questions her school friends can't answer about energy and ancestors about nature as teacher about the divine feminine*
> 
> *We are becoming what we always were before captivity before conversion before shame*

These reflections show how individual spiritual reclamation serves generational healing and children's spiritual education.

## On Cultural Wisdom Recognition

> *This grain that sustained my ancestors through Middle Passage and plantation through Reconstruction and Migration through all that was meant to break us*
> 
> *still rising still nourishing still connecting us to earth and each other*

Food traditions become recognized as spiritual practices that maintained cultural and spiritual connection through historical trauma.

## On Natural Spiritual Authority

> *No stained glass needed when morning light filters through collard leaves like they holy. Because they are.*

Nature becomes recognized as primary spiritual teacher, with gardening and natural world connection serving as authentic spiritual practices.

## On Intergenerational Connection

> *My grandson asks for seconds and I see seven generations fed by the same sacred grain*

Family meals become recognized as spiritual communion connecting past, present, and future generations through cultural food traditions.

## On Spiritual Identity Integration

> *I am what my ancestors practiced before they were told their medicine was witchcraft their wisdom was primitive their spirituality was pagan*

Spiritual identity integrates African ancestral wisdom with contemporary spiritual understanding without rejecting cultural heritage or requiring separation from universal principles.

## On Community Spiritual Impact

> *When I visit my Mexican neighbor I hear the same rich sounds children, grandparents, cousins all tumbling together in joy unworried about being too loud too much too free*

Recognition that African American cultural expressions align with other cultures that maintain connection to joy, community, and natural emotional expression as spiritual practices.

## On Divine Relationship

> *when I call God Mother as often as Father*

Spiritual practice integrates feminine divine recognition with traditional masculine divine imagery, reflecting African spiritual traditions that honored both aspects of divine energy.

## On Body Wisdom and Spiritual Recognition

> *My body remembers how to shake with unfiltered emotion how to let joy rise from belly to throat without stopping to consider if it's appropriate*

Physical expression becomes recognized as spiritual practice rather than behavior needing control or modification to meet external standards.

## On Spiritual Teaching Through Modeling

> *And my niece watches me learning that her beauty needs no permission*

Individual spiritual development becomes teaching for younger generations, demonstrating how personal authenticity serves collective cultural healing and spiritual evolution.

## On Revolutionary Spiritual Practice

> *So I throw back my head and let my laughter rise like prayer like protest like praise*

Laughter and joy become recognized as forms of spiritual practice that serve prayer, resistance, and celebration simultaneously — demonstrating how African American cultural expressions naturally serve spiritual development.

These poetic reflections demonstrate Mabel Thomson's gift for finding universal spiritual wisdom through culturally specific experiences, showing how ordinary African American cultural activities become vehicles for profound spiritual understanding and development.
