### theWAY of Lord Jesus Before the Judeo-Christian Religion

Ever feel like something's missing in religious teaching? Like there's a deeper truth behind all the doctrine and rules? You're not alone. Millions of people sense there's something more authentic, more transformative than what religion offers.

Two thousand years ago, a divine being incarnated in Galilee as the man Jesus to reawaken humanity to an ancient teaching called theWAY. This wasn't a religion, but a practical path of spiritual evolution teaching humans their true purpose — attending this school of divinity for soul beings, to develop from soul-beings into immortal spiritual beings. Lord Jesus taught this wisdom from Egypt to India, showing people how to connect directly with divine reality through energy healing and conscious transformation.

## The Great Transformation

Fifteen years after Lord Jesus left Galilee, a Jewish religious scholar named Paul encountered the People of theWAY. Recognizing potential for religious reform, he borrowed some elements of their teaching, combined them with Jewish scripture, and created a new movement called Christianity. Three centuries later, Roman Emperor Constantine saw political advantage in Paul's creation. The God who demanded absolute obedience and promised to annihilate opposition perfectly suited imperial needs.

Today, while Christianity continues spreading the religion it created about Lord Jesus, Wayists preserve and share what he actually taught — not belief in a wrathful God, but practical wisdom for becoming the divine beings we're meant to be.

## A Revolutionary Understanding

This book reveals how a profound teaching about human spiritual evolution became transformed into a religion of belief and divine punishment. It strips away centuries of accumulated doctrine to reveal something both simpler and more profound: a practical path of spiritual evolution that transforms how we understand both Lord Jesus and our own divine potential.

**This isn't an attack on religion** — it's an invitation to discover something more authentic, a direct path to divine awareness that transcends religious boundaries.
