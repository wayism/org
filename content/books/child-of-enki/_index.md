## The Birth of Written Wisdom

In the mists of time, where history fades into myth and legend, lies a tale of profound significance — the birth of written wisdom. This story begins not with the Sumerians alone, but with their enigmatic predecessors: the peoples of Göbekli Tepe 10,000 years ago and the Ubaid people, who laid the foundations of civilization in the fertile lands between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers long before 5000 BCE.

Around 3000 BCE, the Sumerians emerged as inheritors of this ancient legacy, becoming the first to commit to writing the profound wisdom of theWAY. However, they were not the originators of this wisdom, but its first scribes — preserving teachings that had been passed down through countless generations.

## The First Written Philosophy and Spirituality

Humans started writing around 5,500 years ago in Mesopotamia. After millennia of oral tradition, the primordial philosophy and spirituality of humankind became the first cultural wisdom to be recorded in writing. The Wayist principles of cosmology and spirituality, as documented by the Sumerians, resonate with the earliest philosophy and spirituality of areas now known as India, Mesoamerica, and China.

The sages of old were acutely aware of the economy of words, shrouding deep wisdom in pithy sayings. They recorded masterful delivery of cosmology and spiritual philosophy in just a few lines of text, carved into rock slabs in ancient temples, some of which survive for us to read today.

## The Esoteric Nature of Ancient Text

The nature of esoteric text is that it harbors multiple layers of truth. When junior souls on the Path read with their soul-minds, they receive interpretations relevant to soul development. When senior students read the same text with spirit-mind, they receive deeper spiritual interpretations relevant to immortal consciousness development.

This multilayered wisdom explains how the same Sumerian cosmological teachings served both the religious needs of the masses and the spiritual needs of higher-grade students, giving rise to different religious interpretations while preserving the core spiritual framework.

## The Sumerian Cosmological Framework

The ancient Sumerian text reveals the ontology of theWAY in just four profound lines:

1. "In the beginning there was Nammu, the primeval sea"
2. "Nammu gave birth to An (which expanded as space) and Ki (which expanded as the material energies to fill space)"
3. "An and Ki mated with each other, causing Ki to give birth to Enlil"
4. "Enlil separated from An who took to himself all space/sky, and with Ki, Enlil occupied his cosmos creating the Domains"

This teaching parallels the ancient Chinese Daodejing (500 BCE): "The Unfathomable One gives birth to Two. Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to all things."
