### Philosophical Foundation: Reclaiming Authentic Purpose


## We Did Not Come Here To Be Entertainers

From one lifetime to the next, society instructs us to perform characters they designed for us. The popular narrative, value system, and morals of society dictate much of the character and script they expect us to perform. Society guides us to interpret meanings of events, what emotions to feel, and how to act out those emotions.

Every generation creates new variations on characters. They act like script writers and producers wanting to keep the next season of the sitcom and soap opera interesting. There are profit motives, of course. The sponsors want to make money from it — usually the military industrial complex, big pharma, big corporations, and political parties.

## The Theater of Social Expectations

Currently, newcomers to the world are introduced to the idea that it's important to acknowledge and express all emotions. This results in scripts that are more expressive with richer characters. It has advantages for entertainment, mental health care providers, courts, politics, and the war machine.

Society instills in us shared values and corresponding emotions. Our existence becomes defined by their characters, not our own authenticity, as we live this human life for their entertainment and profit. Society deems you abnormal, subjecting you to ostracism, medication, and pressure to conform.

## The Wayist Rejection of Performance

Our purpose in being here is not to entertain them, but to cultivate our true selves, nurture our soul and authentic spirit, and successfully complete our studies at the School of Divinity for Human Souls.

The Person of theWAY ignores both the character and script. We decline to participate as actors in their production. We embrace authenticity and reject the need to put on a facade.

## Why Authenticity Is Essential

To progress on the spiritual Path, we must live authentically as ourselves. It's impossible to attain self-knowledge and self-improvement if we continue to portray a fake persona based on the popular narratives of race, gender, nationality, cultural stereotypes, and manufactured identities.

Achieving self-understanding requires living authentically. We, as soul and spirit beings, utilize human bodies to acquire life experiences for learning purposes. We won't adopt their script to develop characters encompassing patriotism, classism, and strong racial identity based on historical lineage.

## The Rental Car Analogy

This is comparable to renting a fancy car for a trip, then believing you're a millionaire, forgetting you're just a renter. Your behavior resembles that of a millionaire, people claim you are one, all based on your rental car's image. Then you discover the car manufacturer was embroiled in scandals, and you start believing you were responsible for those scandals from 50 years ago, before you were even born.

After your rental period ends, you return the car and switch to public transportation. Everything that happened in the past is gone. The DNA of the car and bus is irrelevant to you as a passenger — unless you choose to believe otherwise.

## Beyond Cultural Programming

The significance of emotions on our well-being cannot be underestimated. Therefore, having control over our emotions is of utmost value in life. We choose the energies we want to indulge. We are passionate — we can love and lust passionately. We are deeply passionate about the wonders of all life forms in our universe. We indulge many passions and emotions, but only those of our choosing.

## Active Spirituality

Ours is an active spirituality. Every day, we act to work on managing energies and making advances through self-craft. We bring home the bacon, carry water, and chop wood — but what else? That part of life, that "what else," is where the most meaningful parts of life happen.

## The Foundation for All Other Principles

This first principle — recognizing we are not here to entertain — creates the foundation for all authentic spiritual development. When we stop performing roles scripted by others, we create space for genuine self-discovery and spiritual growth.

This shift from performance to authenticity opens the door to engaging with the remaining ten principles from a place of genuine spiritual authority rather than social compliance.

## Living Beyond the Script

The Wayist understanding recognizes that each soul incarnates with specific lessons to learn and wisdom to develop. These purposes cannot be fulfilled while wearing masks and performing characters designed by others for their profit and entertainment.

Breaking free from social scripts requires courage, discernment, and commitment to spiritual truth over social approval. Yet this liberation forms the essential foundation for all meaningful spiritual development.
