*The true story of Mari who worked with Jesus from India to Jerusalem and became the foremost Wayist teacher*

## This is her story ~ This is our story

In the year 33, as Roman legions cast long shadows across Jerusalem and Sanskrit chants echoed through the valleys of the Himalayas, a great light was about to emerge from the intersection of East and West. --- This is not merely a tale of one woman's journey from darkness to light, though it is that. Nor is it simply an account of how a great spiritual teacher walked the Earth and changed it forever, though it is that too. This is the story of how love proved stronger than death, how wisdom flourished in the most unlikely places, and how the greatest spiritual revolution in human history began not in temples or palaces, but in the heart of a girl sold into slavery.

Here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Indian-Brothels-Divine-Guide-Jerusalem-ebook/dp/B0DVR3M6SW/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.com link</a>. E-books, print books, and audiobooks are also available from most online retailers including Spotify, Kobo, Walmart, and other.

## The Revolutionary Story

**Mari of Magadha** was born into a world of rigid divisions — between pure and impure, holy and profane, man and woman, East and West. Sold into slavery as a child, she would walk beside the greatest teacher history has known and become herself a light for countless souls. Her journey would prove that no soul is beyond redemption, no heart too wounded to be healed, no darkness too deep for light to penetrate.

**The Bridge Between Worlds:** Mari's story reveals how Eastern mystical wisdom and Western spiritual yearning converged in revolutionary ways. Her work with Jesus bridged contemplative traditions from India's sacred groves to Jerusalem's ancient stones, creating spiritual principles that transcended all human-made barriers.

**The Revolution of Hearts:** This was not a revolution of swords and armies, but of hearts and minds — transforming how humans understand their relationship with the divine, breaking down walls between heaven and earth, challenging religious hierarchies, and proving that spiritual authority emerges from lived wisdom rather than inherited position.
