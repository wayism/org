# Contemplative Treasury
*Key passages for reflection and inspiration*

## Mari's Voice: Transformation and Recognition

> "I did not know its meaning until that day in Srinagar when he walked into the room where I waited. I was a child in a young woman's tired body, owned by a brothel."

> "He looked at me — through me — and I felt naked in a way no client had ever managed. But, for the first time... nakedness brought no shame."

> "You are no one's property, Mari of Magadha. You never were. Those who bought and sold you will answer to Karma for that sin."

> "Feel the stone, Mari. Feel your feet on the earth. You are here now. You are safe."

> "Your questions come from a place of wisdom. You see through the lies men tell themselves about gods and power."

## On Divine Recognition and Spiritual Authority

> "True divinity has nothing to do with the games of priests and kings, or words in books."

> "You are Mari, and you belong to God our Mother and God our Father in Heaven!"

> "My student. My friend. My sister in The Way."

> "Money is not the problem, but I will not pay him. You are no-one's property to buy and sell."

## Historical Context and Revolution

> "This is not merely a tale of one woman's journey from darkness to light, though it is that."

> "The greatest spiritual revolution in human history began not in temples or palaces, but in the heart of a girl sold into slavery."

> "The world she was born into was one of rigid manmade divisions — between pure and impure, holy and profane, man and woman, East and West."

> "They did not expect wisdom to flow from East to West and back again, carried by them whom society had rejected."

## Spiritual Principles and Transformation

> "No soul is beyond redemption, no heart too wounded to be healed, no darkness too deep for light to penetrate."

> "Love proved stronger than death, how wisdom flourished in the most unlikely places."

> "The truth that divinity dwells not in temples made by human hands, but in the sacred space of the heart."

> "A revolution that would transform how humans understand their relationship with the divine."

## On the Nature of Authentic Spirituality

> "Breaking down the barriers between heaven and earth, between male and female, between East and West, between religion and spirituality."

> "Ancient wisdom persisted. In India's sacred groves, mystics taught that divinity dwells in every heart."

> "The greatest spiritual gateway in human history to open not through ritual or sacrifice, but through the simple recognition that love, humbleness, simplicity, and loving-kindness transcend all boundaries."

## Universal Hope and Continuing Legacy

> "A beacon of hope for all souls, a reminder that no matter where we begin, no matter what burdens we carry, the path to enlightenment remains open."

> "The divine guide remains present, and the possibility of transformation remains eternal."

> "In the great journey of living everyday life with meaning, purpose, and joy, we walk the Butterfly Path to immortality — and no one will ever walk alone."

## The Sacred Feminine and Divine Partnership

> "A sanctuary of the Divine Feminine, an earthly shrine to God our Mother in Heaven, where wisdom has been preserved through countless generations."

> "The Sisters had prepared well for their arrival... magnificent temple rising from the river like a dream of stone and color."

## Wisdom from Lived Experience

> "Come — let's gather the others. Even on a ship, there are lessons to be shared, wisdom to be gained."

> "Each day brought its own teachings, its own opportunities for growth."

> "When they finally reached the sacred island, it would be exactly the right time — just as all things in theWAY happened in their proper season."

## On Spiritual Community and Service

> "I had watched Ruth grow from an eager student to a promising teacher in her own right, combining her father's gift for languages with her own deep spiritual insight."

> "Even after months of hard travel, Ruth's thirst for knowledge remained unquenched."

## The Eternal Promise

> "This is the promise, the good news of the Lord made manifest — that in the great journey of living everyday life with meaning, purpose, and joy, we walk the Butterfly Path to immortality."

> "The good news of the gateway is ongoing to this day."

> "How heaven and earth learned to dance together in a new way, and how a single soul's journey from darkness to light illuminated the path for countless others to follow."

*Om Tare Tuttare Ture Svaha.*

## P.S. - The Continuing Ripples

> "The women working the brothels, all attested how those women had been talking holy things and singing hymns, and meditated, over the past two weeks — ever since they met with Mother Mārīya. Now, they were all gone — definitely to heaven, for sure."

> "Ruth said, 'Ugh...Men!' And amidst life on Earth going about its usual way, on the spiritual side of life, the good news of the gateway is ongoing to this day."
