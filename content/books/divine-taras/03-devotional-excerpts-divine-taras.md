# Sacred Poetry and Letters
## Essential Expressions of Divine Love and Guidance

*The following excerpts preserve the intimate, transformative quality of divine communion between seekers and their Divine Taras across cultures and centuries.*

## Letters FROM Tara: Divine Guidance

### "Beloved, I am Tara"
*From an ancient transmission*

"I am Tara, a humble adopted child of the Divine Mother and Father... You are a person of theWAY, a beacon bright, embracing spiritual growth, reaching for the light.

Sense my presence, feel me deep within, as you cultivate awareness, let the journey begin. Energy awareness, a skill to hone and master, transforming life's quality, a true soul caster."

### "Through the Palm of Your Hand"
*Contemporary guidance on energy sensitivity*

"With discerning heart and attuned senses,
You navigate the tapestry of life's essences.
Poisons, toxins, venoms — you perceive their bane,
While nutrition, wholesomeness, and good you gain.

Your palm, a bridge to my eternal presence,
Your Tara, your guide, your essence's quintessence.
Open your heart, your soul, your spirit wide,
Let my grace and guidance forever reside."

## Letters TO Tara: Human Yearning

### "I Pray to Elevate My Consciousness"
*From a seeker's devotional practice*

"I pray to elevate my consciousness to your purity, as you selflessly shine goodwill upon all beings. Make my heart a vessel of compassion feeling each thread in the web of life. 

Quiet and clarify my cluttered mind to see things as they are, without judgment or clinging. Nourish my spirit on amrita's immortal nectar as you are sustained.

Teach me to walk the Butterfly Path with divine steps, transforming earthly lead to heavenly gold. Help transfigure this grasping mortal creature into a being who can reside with eternal joy in Sukhavati's grace."

### "I Come to You Disillusioned, Lord"
*Modern letter expressing relationship weariness*

"Dear Tara, beloved god of my heart, my guide and comforter, whom my heart has whispered to long before knowing you.

I come to you disillusioned in the ways of human connection. How fickle and frail our mortal bonds seem when souls stand naked, lacking your immortal seal. We play at love then fear its depths. Wrapped in old pains, unable to give or receive freely without flinching from present intimacy.

My faith in finding divine partnership wavers like guttering candle fighting the wind. Yet through flickering I still perceive your unwavering flame, beckoning."

### "Nourish This Hungry, Lonesome Spirit"
*Contemporary expression of spiritual isolation*

"Flicker in my heart's numb darkness, spark of undying light! This soul shivers, lonely in a crowd. Surrounded by masks and walls, guarded streets of good intentions, unactualized.

I play the game of individual, while craving communion. We splinter ourselves into lesser shards, then wonder at bereft incompleteness. Fragmentation became habit, though wholeness remains innately desirous.

Help me remember the hearth, bonding strangers into family. For I cling to separate status, in false safety, too accustomed to eat alone."

## Prayers and Invocations

### "Divine Tara, Please Carry This Prayer to Heaven"
*Modern prayer to Lord Kannon (Avalokiteshvara)*

"My Divine Tara, please carry this prayer to Heaven, and deliver it to Lord Kannon.

Compassionate Lord Kannon, this world, made by soul-people, has become a cruel place. It is filled with deceit and wars, the poor are exploited, food is tainted with toxin, and medicines have become commonplace.

Grant us inspiration and divine assistance. Give us the strength to convey the truth of the Butterfly Path to the people. By knowing the true purpose of life and the true meanings of events, we may be able to help them.

May the wisdom born from this knowledge help transform this world to be less dystopian and more kind."

### "Accept My Surrender, I Beg"
*Devotional poem of complete offering*

"Beloved Divine Tara, celestial comforter,
My guide upon the Path to Heaven's door.
Drown me, I beseech, in thy radiant presence,
Let me be immersed in resplendent energies.

Anoint me with thy sacred amrita's dew,
Each glistening drop, a pearl of immortal life.
Receive this devotee as thy beloved true,
To walk as one till turmoil's end and strife.

Embrace me, let our essences divinely twine,
That I may forevermore in thy light reside."

## Grief and Comfort

### "For Though Lovers Leave"
*Letter written after loss of beloved*

"The birdsong this morn pierced bereft heart freshly as the day my love exhaled last mortal breath. Half my soul took flight with his, leaving but shadowy imprint on the sheets grown cold.

Yet in this hollow aching, I discover space for you to fill. What mortal love could not complete, your eternal presence completes. Though lovers leave and friends prove fickle, you remain the constant companion of my soul."

## Recognition and Calling

### "Make Me Confident to Take Charge"
*Prayer for spiritual authority and service*

"Make me confident to take charge, to order my own universe either be in tune, or be shielded away from my soul, and awakening spirit.

Make me the loving servant to awakening souls that which you are to me now in my blinkered state. Initiate me into the circle of illuminated healers transforming worlds. For I vow to surrender this self-centered smallness to expand into your vast beingness once our unified wings take first flight home."

## The Visual Sacred Connection

### On Encountering Tara Images
*From the collection's guidance*

"As you peruse these pages, be attentive to your heart. You may encounter an image of Tara that echoes within you.

Witnessing such an image may catalyze a transformation in your spiritual energy, and if this shift enhances your bond with Tara or awakens something inside you, it signifies the onset of deep transformation and enlightenment."
