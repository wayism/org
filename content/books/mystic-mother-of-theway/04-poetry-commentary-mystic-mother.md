# Poetry and Commentary
*Sample verses with contemplative insights*

## Mari's Foundational Teaching: The Lotus Rising

**From mud-depths rising,**  
**through waters ascending,**  
**To light transforming---**  
**This is the Way.**

**In darkness binding,**  
**Through love transcending,**  
**To wisdom flowing---**  
**This is the Path.**

**From death emerging,**  
**Through gates ascending,**  
**To heaven returning---**  
**This is our Truth.**

*~ Mother Mari of Magadha*

**Kaori's Insight:** "This poem captures the essence of Mari's understanding of transformation. Like the lotus pods I find in my nets — seemingly tangled and useless until you recognize the perfect seeds within — Mari shows us that our most challenging experiences often carry the greatest potential for beauty."

## On Finding the Sacred in Ordinary Experience

> "Every morning as I prepare my fish market stall in Japan, my hands remember ancient wisdom about how light enters through unexpected places."

> "Mari's verses remind us that light enters through our broken places, that every experience, even the most painful, can become a gateway to deeper understanding."

> "Truth speaks clearest through unwashed fingers."

**Kaori's Market Wisdom:** "Like Mari's verses themselves, they remind us that truth often speaks most clearly when we stop trying to separate the sacred from the ordinary."

## Mari's Multilingual Poetry Style

> "When Mari spoke or wrote, she naturally blended the languages she had gathered on her journey — Prakrit flowing into Koine Greek, Sanskrit emerging through Aramaic tones."

> "Like watching a master weaver at work, I've seen how she would catch a word's gleam in one tongue and let it cast new light through another."

> "A single verse might carry the precision of Sanskrit philosophical terms alongside the emotional directness of Greek lyrical forms, yet somehow remain as clear as temple bells at dawn."

**Kaori's Understanding:** "Her poetry style is unique, like her. Her poems often come in threes, like waves approaching shore — each one carrying the thought a little deeper."

## On Spiritual Authority Through Experience

> "Having walked through the darkest places a human can go, Mari emerged carrying light for others."

> "Her poems don't hide the pain — they acknowledge it fully, yet show how even our deepest wounds can become windows through which divine love and wisdom enters the world."

> "Mari's journey from a wealthy merchant's daughter to slavery in the brothels of Srinagar to her place as one of humanity's greatest spiritual teachers shows us something profound about transformation."

**Kaori's Recognition:** "Her hands, strong from years of hard work, could heal with a touch or gesture with precise grace when teaching."

## The Natural Teaching Model

> "A sparrow lands on my windowsill as I write this, tilting its head as if asking why humans need so many words to say what nature demonstrates in a single gesture. Mari would have smiled at that."

> "Geraldo the gecko pauses on my wall now, winking at me, its translucent skin revealing how blood moves through its body — another teaching about how truth becomes visible when we learn to see beneath surface appearances."

**Kaori's Integration:** "The cats are often better teachers than I am. They know what's truly fresh."

## On Divine Presence and Transformation

> "This is what Mari taught: that wisdom reveals itself not through rejecting any part of our experience but through bringing full presence to every moment."

> "She taught us how light enters through our broken places."

> "Truth reveals itself wherever we are, whenever we're ready, if only we learn to look with the heart's eye."

> "Every moment carries its own kind of holiness, that every being holds its own kind of light, that love transforms everything it touches into something sacred."

## The Three-Wave Pattern

**Mari's Teaching Structure:**
*First the physical reality that anchors us in our humanity,*  
*then the heart's response to that reality,*  
*and finally the spiritual truth that emerges when we have the courage to embrace both.*

**Kaori's Understanding:** "I've noticed how she rarely speaks of the divine without first grounding us in the earthly, as if to remind us that transcendence grows from, not despite, our human nature."

## Contemporary Application

> "Through her writings and example, Mother Mari has been a constant companion on my Path and that is why I wanted to share some of her poems with you."

> "Throughout my life of typical hardships, heartaches, disappointments, joys, the monotonous grind at my everyday job, my winters in Mexico and summers in Japan, I've witnessed what Mari describes about wisdom flowing through every aspect of existence."

**Kaori's Validation:** "I find myself contemplating how Mari's words flow like water — finding their way through any vessel while maintaining their essential nature, somehow finding their way into every crack and crevice of a wounded soul."

## The Light Teaching

> "Geraldo has been joined by the moth now, each creature perfectly expressing its nature while sharing the same small space. The light attracting both, and we each find our own reason why, but we're all attracted to the Light."

> "Some ignore it, some try to force it, some try to buy it."

**Kaori's Wisdom:** "Like Mari's verses themselves, they remind us that truth often speaks most clearly when we stop trying to separate the sacred from the ordinary."

## On Mystical Community and Service

> "A small shrine in the corner of her stall holds a picture of Mari and a bowl of fresh water for stray cats."

> "Each morning, she offers both fresh fish and fresh insights to those who stop by."

> "May her words continue to illuminate the path for all who seek to understand how heaven and earth dance together in perfect harmony."

**Integration Practice:** "When asked about her unusual combination of occupations, she often quotes Mari: 'Truth speaks clearest through unwashed fingers.'"

## Seasonal Mystical Awareness

> "This spring morning as I sort these precious verses, watching cherry petals drift past my window..."

> "Her verses carry the scent of both East and West, like the morning breeze that brings both mountain snow and sea salt to my garden."

> "As I close this collection, the first hint of dawn touches the eastern sky."

**Natural Mysticism:** "I will have finished this manuscript and be on the patio cuddling up to a warm cup of coffee when the sun rises — my eyes bloodshot, brain tired, body sore from days in the same position — but rejuvenated from having walked with Mother Mari this road."

## The Simple Images Teaching

> "The images she chooses are simple — lotus flowers pushing through mud, water finding its level, light catching in dewdrops. Yet through these ordinary things, she shows us the extraordinary."

> "A butterfly emerging from its chrysalis becomes a teaching about transformation. Market vendors calling their wares become a lesson in the nature of impermanence."

> "Even a child's skinned knee can open into a discourse on compassion."

**Kaori's Recognition:** "What moves me most is how she transforms suffering into wisdom and experience the divine in the ordinary."

## The Living Stream Teaching

> "Her teaching flows like a clear stream, wearing away our delusions not through force but through persistent truth."

> "These poems are not just words on paper but windows into a way of seeing that transforms everything it touches."

> "Through them, Mari continues to show us how to find divine light in the temple of our own experience, in the sacred text of our own hearts."

**Practical Application:** "Each poem carries its own particular medicine, yet together they weave something larger — a vision of how spirit works through flesh, how divine love transforms everything it touches."
