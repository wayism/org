# Mystic Mother of theWAY
*Curated collection of the poems of Mari of Magadha who walked with Jesus*

## Finding Heaven's Light Through Ancient Wisdom

Every morning as Kaori Mizuki prepares her fish market stall in Japan, her hands remember ancient wisdom about how light enters through unexpected places. These poems by Mari of Magadha speak to that same truth — about how divine presence reveals itself not despite our humanity but through it.

**Mari of Magadha** walked with Lord Jesus for years, learning everything about theWAY — the healing, spiritual technology, energy work, the philosophy. She taught women and children from India to Galilee to Egypt and Aksum, but she also learned about her true self, her spiritual self, and that is theWAY which she teaches — the Path to fulfill our spiritual potential.

## The Revolutionary Teacher

Mari's journey from a wealthy merchant's daughter to slavery in the brothels of Srinagar to her place as one of humanity's greatest spiritual teachers shows us something profound about transformation. Like the lotus pods and seeds brimming with potential for beauty Kaori sometimes finds tangled in her freshwater nets, wisdom often grows strongest in places others consider unclean.

**Her verses remind us that light enters through our broken places,** that every experience, even the most painful, can become a gateway to deeper understanding. Through her writings and example, Mother Mari has been a constant companion on the spiritual Path for seekers across nearly two millennia.

## Kaori's Contemplative Curation

Through her life of typical hardships, heartaches, disappointments, joys, and the monotonous grind at her everyday job — winters in Mexico and summers in Japan — Kaori has witnessed what Mari describes about wisdom flowing through every aspect of existence and light with joy to be found in every crevice of everyday existence.

**The Market Vendor as Contemplative Scholar:** Kaori's decades of careful attention to fish freshness, customer needs, and seasonal patterns have developed the same quality of receptive awareness that allows her to receive Mari's ancient wisdom with fresh insight. Her hands that know fish quality also recognize the authentic spiritual authority flowing through Mari's verses.

**Truth Through Unwashed Fingers:** As Mari taught, "Truth speaks clearest through unwashed fingers." Kaori's approach to these sacred poems emerges from the same contemplative philosophy that finds heaven in fish guts — recognizing that authentic spiritual wisdom flows through practical experience rather than academic study.

## Mari's Mystical Poetry Style

Mari's poetry style is unique, reflecting her extraordinary journey bridging East and West. Her poems often come in threes, like waves approaching shore — each one carrying the thought a little deeper. When Mari spoke or wrote, she naturally blended the languages she had gathered on her journey — Prakrit flowing into Koine Greek, Sanskrit emerging through Aramaic tones.

**The Weaving Method:** Like watching a master weaver at work, Mari would catch a word's gleam in one tongue and let it cast new light through another. A single verse might carry the precision of Sanskrit philosophical terms alongside the emotional directness of Greek lyrical forms, yet somehow remain as clear as temple bells at dawn.

**Grounded Transcendence:** Mari rarely speaks of the divine without first grounding us in the earthly, as if to remind us that transcendence grows from, not despite, our human nature. Her images are simple — lotus flowers pushing through mud, water finding its level, light catching in dewdrops — yet through these ordinary things, she shows us the extraordinary.

## The Sacred Collection

**Mari's Transformation Through Poetry:** Having walked through the darkest places a human can go, Mari emerged carrying light for others. Her poems don't hide the pain — they acknowledge it fully, yet show how even our deepest wounds can become windows through which divine love and wisdom enters the world.

**Kaori's Contemporary Lens:** Through her own contemplative development, Kaori recognizes in Mari's words the same truth she finds in the rhythms of market life — that wisdom comes not from escaping our ordinary human experience but through paying closer attention to it.
