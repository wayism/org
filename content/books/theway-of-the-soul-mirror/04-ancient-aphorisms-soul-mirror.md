# Ancient Aphorisms
## Essential Wisdom from the 63 Foundational Teachings

These selected aphorisms demonstrate how profound spiritual instruction conceals itself within apparently simple moral guidance. Each statement contains multiple layers of meaning — surface guidance for daily life, systematic instruction for energy management, and complete methodology for spiritual transformation. The 63 aphorisms were designed to survive persecution by appearing as harmless platitudes while containing transformative wisdom.

## On Spiritual Leadership and Governance

**Aphorism 1:** *"For seventeen generations I have been reincarnated as a leader in communities. I have never oppressed people. Never maltreated my subordinates. I have helped them in misfortune; I have rescued them from poverty; I have taken compassion on their orphans."*

Real leadership means serving others, not exploiting them. A true leader helps people when they're struggling, doesn't abuse those under their authority, and takes care of the most vulnerable. This is the standard we should demand from anyone in power.

**Aphorism 8:** *"Educate old souls of goodness to serve as civil government. Pay them well and expect exemplary service."*

Choose leaders based on character and competence, not appearance or campaign funding. Pay them well to prevent corruption. Demand excellent performance — if they fail, remove them. Modern systems that protect incompetent leaders from accountability violate this basic wisdom.

**Aphorism 43:** *"Those who have power to affect the lives of others have thrust upon them great responsibility of care."*

Power creates obligation, not privilege. The more influence you have over others' lives, the greater your responsibility to use it wisely. This applies to parents, teachers, bosses, leaders — anyone whose choices affect other people's wellbeing.

## On Life's Ultimate Success and Energy Management

**Aphorism 3:** *"Whoever wants to be ultimately successful in life should expand the fields of contentment, joy, and happiness; let them lay this teaching as foundation at the bottom of their heart."*

Real success isn't just money or status — it's being content, joyful, and happy across all areas of life: physical health, mental peace, good relationships, sufficient resources, spiritual meaning, and knowing your next life will be better because of how you lived this one.

**Aphorism 6:** *"What is theWAY but the flow of energies that make possible the purpose of life? What is the purpose of life other than metamorphosis of the mortal soul to immortal spirit? Therefore, hold only good energy and you will obtain spiritual skills to fulfill the purpose of life."*

Life's purpose is growing from a temporary physical being into something permanent and spiritual. This happens by choosing good influences, good thoughts, and good actions consistently. Bad energy keeps you stuck; good energy helps you evolve.

**Aphorism 44:** *"Following theWAY ensures wealth because it is especially important in the human condition. True wealth is balanced in all six realms. Think not yourself rich; never deceive, and never ignore the suffering of beings."*

Real wealth isn't just money — it's having good health, peace of mind, loving relationships, enough resources, spiritual meaning, and knowing your future will be bright. Don't get arrogant when things go well, don't lie or cheat, and help others when they're suffering.

## On Acceptance and Spiritual Adaptation

**Aphorism 5:** *"The way to tranquil minds and inner success is accepting whatever situation you find yourself; be grateful for all you have to work with, to improve things; adapting to conditions; seeking nothing more than to distil from the experience whatever wisdom is needed to become an immortal spiritual being."*

Peace comes from working with reality instead of fighting it. Accept where you are, be grateful for what you have, adapt to circumstances, and focus on learning whatever will make you wiser and stronger. Fighting reality only creates suffering.

**Aphorism 9:** *"Let your heart be like theWAY, unbiased and wide of range. Keep as protection for your heart the talisman of the lotus and the butterfly."*

Don't let personal preferences and prejudices narrow your heart. Stay open to truth regardless of where it comes from. Remember that growth requires transformation — like the lotus rising from mud or the caterpillar becoming a butterfly.

## On Divine Honesty and Spiritual Guidance

**Aphorism 7:** *"Be honest like Heaven in conducting your affairs. Who are the buddhas, immortals, gods, and angels? They are spiritual beings who work to help us along this Path, to also become immortal like them. This is the honesty of Heaven; they know all our thoughts and intentions, yet they are prepared to sacrifice for our sake."*

Be completely honest in everything you do. Spiritual beings who have evolved beyond human limitations are trying to help you do the same. They see everything you think and do, yet they still love you and want to help you grow — that's real honesty and real love.

**Aphorism 48:** *"Hold as friends, entities with healing attitude and benevolent energy. Work on your relationship with immortals and your spiritual guides. Keep the immortals and spiritual teachers as your eternal family."*

Surround yourself with people who build you up, not tear you down. Develop relationship with spiritual guides who can help you grow. Choose your influences carefully — they shape who you become.

## On Universal Connection and Natural Harmony

**Aphorism 12:** *"Allow in your heart a place for people who worship differently and believe differently."*

Don't hate people just because they have different religious or spiritual beliefs. Truth is bigger than any single tradition, and good people exist in all faiths.

**Aphorism 13:** *"All dharmas flow in the subtle Way."*

All genuine spiritual teachings point toward the same truth, even if they use different words and methods.

**Aphorism 30:** *"When walking, be mindful of worms and ants. Thank the tree, talk to the rice, acknowledge the insect, befriend the birds and the mice."*

Pay attention to all living things, not just humans. Everything is connected. Gratitude and awareness toward all life develops wisdom and compassion.

## On Service and Community Building

**Aphorism 27:** *"Light lanterns in the night to illuminate where people walk. Keep boats on rivers to ferry people across."*

Help others navigate difficult situations. When you see someone struggling, provide practical assistance to help them get through it. Be useful to others.

**Aphorism 28:** *"Be the voice of animals, plants, and those without status."*

Stand up for those who can't defend themselves. This includes both the powerless in human society and the natural world being destroyed for profit. Real justice considers all beings, not just those with money and influence.

**Aphorism 54:** *"Always be building bridges to be crossed by thousands, and hundreds of thousands."*

Create things that help many people, not just yourself. Build businesses, write books, teach skills, or create anything that makes life better for lots of people. Think beyond your own immediate needs.

## On Energy Purification and Protection

**Aphorism 50:** *"That which fills the heart will flow from the mouth. Guard the purity of the heart center, it is the gateway to Heaven."*

What you put into your heart comes out in your words and actions. Keep your heart filled with good things if you want good things to come out of your life.

**Aphorism 60:** *"Anything to do with bad energy, refrain from engaging. All good energies, indulge!"*

Avoid people, activities, and influences that drain your vitality or corrupt your character. Surround yourself with what builds you up. This isn't complicated — if something consistently makes you feel worse about yourself or life, eliminate it.

**Aphorism 47:** *"Reject hatred and revenge; see malice for what it is, the energy of another person's karma."*

Don't take others' bad behavior personally — it's their problem, not yours. Responding with hatred only damages your own energy. Understanding this keeps you free from being controlled by other people's dysfunction.

## On Daily Spiritual Practice

**Aphorism 58:** *"Keep the ancient sages before your mind's eyes, even at evening meal, or when looking over the fence."*

Remember wise people and their teachings throughout your day, not just when you're in a formal religious setting. Let wisdom guide your ordinary activities.

**Aphorism 59:** *"Be mindful of theWAY when you are alone, in private times."*

Your character is who you are when nobody's watching. Maintain your integrity even when no one will know if you cheat or cut corners.

**Aphorism 55:** *"Let your energy be your teaching on morality, encouraging people to want to be like you; lead a full and eventful life."*

Teach by example, not by preaching. Live so well that others want to learn from you. Don't be boring or preachy — be someone others admire and want to emulate.

## On Karma and Spiritual Consequences

**Aphorism 61:** *"Karmic consequences may be immediate, and you will receive them in person, or it may be remote and will transfer upon your future lives."*

Your actions have consequences, sometimes right away, sometimes later. What you do now affects not just this life but future lives too. Choose accordingly.

**Aphorism 62:** *"Blessings come hundredfold, in loads, as if delivered in wagons. Good fortune is piled up thousandfold, like a mass of clouds."*

Good actions create far more good results than you might expect. Goodness multiplies itself — one good deed often leads to many more blessings than you put in.

## On Ancient Wisdom Integration

**Aphorism 53:** *"Repair ruins, even though for hundreds of years they have remained."*

Fix things that are broken, even if they've been broken for a long time and everyone else has given up on them. Sometimes the most important work is restoring what others think is hopeless.

**Aphorism 63:** *"Do not all these secret sayings add to the heart of the Subtle Way?"*

All these teachings work together to show you how to live wisely. They're not just random advice — they're a complete system for becoming the kind of person you're meant to be.

## The Esoteric Nature of Simple Truth

**The Hidden Wisdom:** These aphorisms survived persecution by appearing as ordinary moral advice while containing complete guidance for spiritual development. Their simplicity protected profound wisdom from those who would destroy it.

**Living Application:** Each aphorism works when you actually live it, not just understand it intellectually. Through simple daily actions — being honest in business, helping those in need, choosing good influences — you develop wisdom and character that lasts beyond this lifetime.

**The Beauty of Disguised Wisdom:** What government would ban teachings about being kind to orphans or honest in commerce? Yet living these simple principles transforms you completely. The ancients understood that the most powerful wisdom often looks ordinary on the surface.
