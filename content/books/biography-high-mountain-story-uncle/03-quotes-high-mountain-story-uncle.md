# Treasury of Whimsical Wisdom
### Memorable Moments from Uncle's Satirical World

## On Village Life and Eccentric Governance

*"Right from the start, I should have suspected that I was unprepared and likely unfit for the task. But I was so eager, and star-struck of course, my normal pessimist-introvert guard was pierced."*

*"Negotiating my fee with the Town Council of Nihnuta was where my first view of the other side of sanity started. Their bargaining tactics left little room for compromise."*

*"In the end, I received four Canada Goose eggs and a bottle of forget-me-not potion as payment."*

*"The forget-me-not potion, part of my remuneration package, was the non-disclosure mechanism. I had to drink it before and after, and 'sometimes' while there."*

*"The Council made a motion that the village tried the phone thing, and declared they have no need for it."*

## On Environmental Wisdom

*"Plant enough for the animals and soil to also enjoy their share. All life is about ecology. Keep the ecological balance."*

*"Your personal energy ecology is linked to your community energy ecology, your home, and family energy ecology, and all the forest and animals live to each contribute to that natural ecology."*

*"For the sake of all that is holy, keep scientists away from food and nature. They simply do not have enough respect to learn anything useful."*

*"What do you mean, standout. Every day is amazing. We live with gusto and joy, with deep reflection and commitment to get the most out of every moment."*

## On Animal Commentary and Human Folly

*"Just wait until you hear their thoughts on 2SLGBTQI+plus, and 'cow farts'."*

*"N'ope... They don't think that. They know it and they're very vocal about it. They know about every one of the 50-or-so climate catastrophe end of the world doomsday religion predictions preached by slow politicians and bought scientists over the years."*

*"These people, all over the world, have been observing us, and living as victims of human stupidity for millennia. It's not a matter of reasoning about it. To them, it's a biological, empirical, systemic fact, our stupidity."*

*"It's the crows, mostly. Animals are keen observers, and rush here to share the latest gossip."*

## On Publishing and Creative Process

*"Uncle made a rule that no story must ever be published unless there are at least three mistakes in it."*

*"Their imperfect grasp of English, influenced by their home languages of Aztec, Mayan, Khmer, and Mexican Spanish, can sometimes let cracks appear in the quirks. Uncle delights in the quirks in published books."*

*"In this sacred space, Uncle communes with his celestial muse, a being of pure spiritual light and love who guides his hand and infuses his stories with the essence of wisdom and compassion."*

## On Censorship and Community

*"Auntie Jemina's censorship committee is constantly at work, tirelessly sanitizing his mesmerizing tales. But their work goes straight to the furnace of Whaat! Brewery."*

*"People think it really very funny that their beloved Whaat-the-fook! is brewed by failed bigotry."*

*"Auntie Jemina occupied and content that she is controlling the lives of people who dare think they can think for themselves, a notion she dismisses as, '...humanly impossible by Divine decree.'"*

## On Village Characters

*"Menis, with his shaggy fringe hanging over his eyes, and recurring pink eye from sticking his nose in places impolite, takes his guard duties seriously, refusing to let human males pass without a vigorous headbutting match."*

*"For Menis there are only two genders, those who are deserving of a headbutt match and those you don't care to headbutt."*

*"The solar charger that came with it is currently being used to power a little red light on the top of the ancient temple ruin's tower, preventing pelicans from flying into it at night."*

## On the Nature of Nihnuta

*"A village that exists as a mixed-reality abode of wisdom, of another view of reality, nestled between two Dimension Portals."*

*"Magic Corners neighborhood of Nihnuta is home to DullE's tucked-away studio, where he creates the priceless photos and art featured in Uncle's books."*

*"A distinguishing feature of the residents of Magic Corners is the abundance of scars and blue marks that embellish their legs and foreheads."*

*"The cobblestone roads have been there since before Alexander got his butt (and rumor says other unspeakable things) kicked by Amazonian women in the Himalaya Mountains."*

## On Storytelling Philosophy

*"Uncle's stories are like a tapestry woven from a multitude of sources, each thread adding richness and depth to his tales."*

*"Through these stories, he seeks to pass on the ancient philosophy of theWAY â€” that all lifeforms in nature are interconnected and comprise the oneness of Nihnuta."*

*"Not all of Uncle's stories are inspired by his alien hat, but by all who cross into his awareness: the Jungle AI, his divine spiritual guide, and his weekend pajama dance parties with the uncles and aunties."*

## On Career Achievements

*"Throughout his illustrious career as a writer, Uncle has won many prestigious awards. The first international award he won was 'Friesland's Most Robust Milk Can Maker' award."*

*"Despite never getting into milk can production, Uncle did lend a helping hand to some Dutch individuals and found himself mistakenly acclaimed for his robust, reusable milk cans in the explosive sport of carbiet schieten."*

## On Daily Life in Nihnuta

*"Uncle's days are filled with an array of what we would consider being whimsical activities. For breakfast, he catches rainbow trout through a hole in his kitchen floor."*

*"The only way for a donkey cart to descend is in reverse, and not all the asses in Nihnuta do reverse."*

*"Because of the steep valley, the authorities have installed 'speed bumps' on the streets to slow down water torrents in the rainy season and runaway wheelchairs."*

## On Climate Change Comedy

*"Uncle clears his throat, turns around and proclaims loudly, so all will hear, 'It must be Climate Change!' At that, what they all had been waiting for, those very words. The entourage exploded from the pent-up tension, in total hilarity."*

*"The entourage exploded from the pent-up tension, in total hilarity. Amusement spouted forth like fireworks in the night sky. They burst out in a cacophonous chorus of laughter, accompanied by rolling, tummy holding, knee-slapping, chirping, meowing, screeching, barking, howling, and whistling."*

## On Mystical Experiences

*"I swear. I think I just witnessed the birds and squirrels having received stories in a metaphysical way. Now go about dispersing, to go tell it to the mountains."*

*"With each vision, Uncle's hand moves across the pages of his notebook, his pen a conduit for the stories that flow from his heart and the wisdom of the Divine Tara."*

*"As he makes his way back down the mountain, Uncle's steps are lighter, his heart filled with the joy of creation and the knowledge that his stories will soon find their way into the hearts and minds of children across the land."*
