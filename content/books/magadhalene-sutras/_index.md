### Ancient Teachings of Mari of Magadha, Foremost Disciple of Lord Jesus

**Sacred letters and teachings from Lord Jesus's foremost disciple**

## Revolutionary Ancient Treasure

This extraordinary collection preserves the earliest literary contributions of **Mari of Magadha** — the most dedicated long-term disciple of Lord Jesus and arguably the most influential woman in early spiritual history. These sacred letters and teachings, compiled by the International Association of Wayist Organizations (IAWO), offer unprecedented glimpse into authentic first-century Wayist teaching and the revolutionary ministry of a remarkable woman.

Here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magadhalene-Sutras-Wayist-Collection-Iawo/dp/0987680064/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.com link</a>. E-books, print books, and audiobooks are also available from most online retailers including Spotify, Kobo, Walmart, and other.

## Mari of Magadha: The Unsung Hero

**Mari spent more time training and living with Lord Jesus than any other human being.** Once an enslaved child, she devoted over sixty years to the Wayist cause, traveling with Jesus for ten years throughout Northern India, Kashmir, Pakistan, Iraq, and Judea. She was present at the most significant moments — meetings with the Gondophares family in Kashmir, founding of Wayist communities in the Himalayas, the crucifixion, and the resurrection.

### The Most Powerful Leader

**Mari's achievements surpass even those of Saint Thomas:** She founded what Christians today call the Johannine Community, wrote the original Gospel of the Beloved Disciple (4th Gospel), and established Wayist communities among marginalized women across Kashmir, Pakistan, Iraq, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Aksum. Under her guidance, more Wayist communities were founded and sustained than through any other apostle's work.

### Pioneer of the Feminist Movement

**Mari represents the most important figure in the worldwide feminist movement.** A first-century slave, female, sexually abused child, and former prostitute from India — speaking Greek with an Indian accent, wearing her sari with bindi, she transformed hearts and minds across northern India, the Middle East, Egypt, and northern Africa. After her death, the Wayist community had to hide her leadership, referring to her only as "the beloved disciple," and Christianity later wrote her completely out of their history.

## The Sacred Collection

### Ancient Anthology Format

**The Magadhalene Sutras** comprise letters, notes, and teachings that circulated among the Magadhalenes — the feminist Wayist movement that developed around Mari. This anthology includes contributions from multiple first-century authors including Mari herself, Xenophon, Siphor, and possibly Saint Thomas.

### Three Sacred Sets

**This "First Collection"** represents the foundational teachings used for esoteric instruction and inner circle training. The Second and Third sets contain increasingly advanced material — the Third dealing exclusively with the Sacred Sensuality tradition maintained by the monastic Magadhalene order.

### Historical Authentication

These works have been translated and copied across two millennia, yet Wayists take them seriously because **they teach the same core message Wayists have preserved throughout history**. They illustrate how first-century teachers expounded Wayist principles to common people of their era.
