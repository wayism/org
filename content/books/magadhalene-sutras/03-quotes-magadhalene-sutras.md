## Letters to Early Communities

### Opening of First Letter

> "To the brothers and sisters of The Way in glorious Jerusalem. I pray and trust these gifts receive you well and that you are in good mind during such turbulent times for you."

> "Our thoughts are constantly with you and in our prayers, we never forget you, neither does the Lord or our community in the Kush forget you."

> "We hear news from any number of devotees who come to Srinagar. Also, the captain of the Bacchia who brought your letter to this port is a godly man who often sends someone with news of The Way in Egypt and Judea."

## On Sacred Sensuality Teaching

### The Eight Principles

> "These eight principles of sacred sensuality lead to the highest awakening: through the light of this teaching, everyone can be saved."
> 
> *Sutra 153*

> "This Teaching existed in Heaven from the beginning, and it brings great blessing as well as good fortune."
> 
> *Sutra 154*

> "It brings fortune for everyone as great as the sheerest mountain, and there is nothing to compare with it."
> 
> *Sutra 155*

### Warning for the Uninitiated

> "However, take heed of its dangers, for the uninitiated, without guidance of my bodhisattvas, surely will burn in the fires of the passions, and lose what little advance they had made."
> 
> *Sutra 156*

## On Divine Love and Spiritual Relationship

### Love Beyond Categories

> "How can you define what is beyond definition? How can you define my love for the Lord?"
> 
> *Sutra 161*

> "Is my love erotic, as some have said, or is my love familial, as others have said, or is my love pious and pretentious as some women have scandalised? Or, is my love for the Lord of the same nature as His love for me, which is the same love He holds for everyone?"
> 
> *Sutra 161*

### Proof Through Experience

> "How can we prove our love if we cannot define it? In proof, our minds seek a justice, a measure, according to our own abilities. Proof changes from person to person."
> 
> *Sutra 162*

> "There is no way to prove the Teaching of the Lord is true, only in the eating and digesting thereof will the proof be made manifest in you."
> 
> *Sutra 162*

## On Spiritual Authority and Authenticity

### The Challenge of Verification

> "I, who love the Lord, who was saved by Him from many deadly trials even in India, Gilgit, and Syria and in Egypt, Ethiopia and Aksum. I, whom many call on to teach them, I study this myself â€” yet there's no way to prove it because you do not see me reading the Teaching night and day."
> 
> *Sutra 160*

> "How can it be that I am truly studying it? Can anyone witness to say I am studying it? Why is it like this? Because it cannot be proved."
> 
> *Sutra 160*

### Warning About False Teachers

> "There is no way to prove the student of sacred sensuality is a true devotee, only in associating with such a person can the energies be made manifest to you. Therefore, heed the Lord's teaching and withhold from practicing this teaching unless at the feet of a master. Charlatans are among us, more plentiful and crafty than one can imagine."
> 
> *Sutra 162*

## On Spiritual Practice and Awakening

### Embracing the Divine Way

> "Embracing all things, sensing the Divine Way in everything, discovering depths of holy ecstasy even in the mundane, how much more when energies conjoin."
> 
> *Sutra 152*

### Universal Awakening Promise

> "O Gather all you good people, worship and sing! The Light will come and enlighten you; you will discover the all-embracing knowing, the mystery will lead you to Peace and Happiness."
> 
> *Sutra 157*

> "By this, you shall ascend to rebirth, it is a place of hard to believe blessing beyond all conceivable imagining. And it is for everyone."
> 
> *Sutra 158*

## Community Response and Devotion

### Ancient Worship Expression

> "Then everyone got to their feet, bowed, and sang: 'All Praise to the Limitless One, Great is the Supreme Highest One. You teach us the Triumphant Law as it is in its depth and mystery, beyond imagining. And though I don't pretend to understand I will go on studying until the end.'"
> 
> *Sutra 159*

## Historical Editorial Notes

### Preservation Philosophy

> "We prefer to keep the work intact, as is, imperfect as it may be, to speak for itself. These works have, conceivably, been translated and copied many, many times over the past two thousand years."

### Wayist Validation

> "Why Wayists take these writings seriously is that it teaches the same message that Wayists have held for all this time. Furthermore, there is a healthy sense of whimsy in the antiquity and history."

## Church of the East Commentary (1996)

### On Esoteric Teaching

> "Scripture attest to the fact that the Lord shared esoteric teaching with St. Magadhalene and St. Thomas that He, in His infinite wisdom chose not to share with all others, even apostles."

### On Divine Timing

> "Did the Lord Himself not say, 'Nothing that is hidden will not be uncovered in its due time'? Lest we forget, it is always prudent to recall our own walk, and how, every other moment another Teaching is revealed in our hearts; since, 'when the pupil is ready the Teacher shall appear.'"
