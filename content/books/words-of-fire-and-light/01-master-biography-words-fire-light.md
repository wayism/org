## A Life Between Spiritual Worlds (1927-2002)

## Early Years: The Confluence of Traditions

Born as Yerem Nazaryan in the ancient city of Konya — where the great Sufi mystic Rumi lies buried — +Yusa entered a world torn between tradition and modernization. His father, Mehmet Nazaryan, was a respected dervish of the Mevlevi Order, known for their meditative whirling ceremonies and dedication to spiritual enlightenment. His mother, Mariam, came from an aristocratic Armenian Christian family decimated by genocide.

Their unlikely union embodied the very synthesis of traditions that would later characterize +Yusa's teaching. The household resonated with both the sound of the ney (Sufi flute) and Armenian hymns. This dual spiritual inheritance was further enriched by exposure to local Yazidi and Kurdish mystical traditions.

+Yusa would later write: "My earliest memories are of my father's prayer rug beside my mother's icons, and how the morning light made no distinction between them. This was my first lesson in the unity of all paths."

## Formation of Spiritual Authority

His ordination as Mar Yusa in the Ancient Church of the East came after years of intense study in various traditions. This church, distinct from mainstream Christianity, preserved teachings traced back to Jesus's time in Kashmir and Thomas's missionary work in India. +Yusa's appointment marked him as a preserver of an endangered lineage of spiritual knowledge.

During the 1950s and early 1960s, he traveled extensively throughout Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kashmir, gathering teachings and connecting with isolated spiritual communities. He was known to appear unexpectedly in remote monasteries and Sufi tekkes, engaging in deep philosophical discussions that would last for days.

## Years of Trial and Transformation

The 1970s brought both elevation and tribulation. As head of the Wayist movement across a vast region from Baghdad to Calcutta, he worked to preserve and unify various strands of ancient wisdom. However, his inclusive approach and refusal to conform to rising religious fundamentalism made him a target.

His kidnapping and torture by extremists in 1972 became a defining moment. After weeks of captivity and severe physical abuse, he was left broken in Srinagar's market square. His response to this ordeal became legendary among his students. Upon regaining consciousness, his first recorded words were: "Even in darkness, the lotus grows toward light."

This experience became foundational to his teaching about transformation through suffering, though he would never detail the experience itself, preferring to focus on the spiritual insights that emerged from it.

## The Teacher Emerges

Despite chronic pain from his injuries, the following decades saw +Yusa's most productive period as a teacher and preserver of wisdom. He established a unique teaching style that drew from multiple traditions while maintaining the pure essence of Wayist thought. His lessons were delivered in a distinctive mixture of languages and metaphors, often challenging students to think beyond conventional religious boundaries.

He was known for saying: "Truth speaks in many accents, but always tells the same story." His teachings incorporated elements from Sufi mysticism, Christian contemplation, Buddhist mindfulness, and Hindu yogic practices, all while maintaining what he called "the golden thread of Wayist wisdom."

## Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

In his later years, +Yusa became increasingly focused on preserving ancient teachings for future generations. His decision to ordain Teacher +Yajn in 1999 for the Anglophone world reflected his recognition that Wayist wisdom needed to adapt to reach Western audiences while maintaining its essential purity.

He concentrated his efforts in mystical studies and teaching in the Ashambu hills, where he developed relationships with the Wayist mystics and Kanikkaran forest people. These biodiversity-rich Western Ghats became the center of modern Wayism, where "Avalokiteshvara is more alive and closer than anywhere else."

Always discrete and esoteric, +Yusa helped Indian Christians find peace with their inherited religion by revealing the real teachings of Teacher Jesus. He assisted Muslims in understanding the mystical side of their faith, and helped Shaivites, Buddhists, and Vaishnavas see the deeper mysteries and oneness of all spiritual teaching.

As his students remembered: "He never asked anyone to accept Wayism as their 'new' faith. He always said, 'we help souls find Spirit, we are not in the entertainments of politics of social movements.'"

## The Living Example

Despite suffering from severe arthritis due to his torture injuries, +Yusa continued teaching until his final days. His last written words, found on his desk in Jammu, read: "The path continues beyond the horizon we can see. Walk on, dear ones, walk on."

His life exemplified what he taught: that authentic spiritual authority emerges not from academic achievement or social position, but from the integration of wisdom through lived experience, demonstrated character, and the courage to preserve truth across changing circumstances.

+Yusa embodied his teaching that effective spiritual instruction is always contextual (*upaya*), adapted to the student and their circumstances, while maintaining the essential core of timeless wisdom that transcends cultural and temporal boundaries.
