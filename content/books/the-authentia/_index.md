# theWAY of The Authentia
## Ancient Wayist Wisdom for the Modern Seeker

*Edited by Salvar Dàosenglu*

For millennia, The Authentia has been a guiding light for seekers of truth, a sacred tome cherished in the hallowed halls of Wayist training centers. Its pages contain the very essence of Wayist philosophy, the foundational principles for understanding the nature of being itself and the architecture of reality.

Here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentia-Ancient-Wayist-Wisdom-Modern/dp/1998478300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.com link</a>. E-books, print books, and audiobooks are also available from most online retailers including Spotify, Kobo, Walmart, and other.

## The Historic Decision

In 2023, a momentous decision was made. The Board of Elders of theWAY, in their infinite wisdom, chose to share this treasure with the world. No longer would The Authentia's profound insights be confined to cloistered sanctuaries, privy only to a select few who could receive its deeper meanings through qualified teachers. It was time for the veil to be lifted, for the light of its teachings to illuminate the path for all of humanity.

## A Complete Ontological Framework

At the core of The Authentia is a comprehensive ontology — a complete understanding of the fundamental questions that define human experience: Why are we here? What is our purpose? Where do we come from and where are we headed?

The text illuminates:
- The nature of the mind and origins of the soul
- The myriad forms of spiritual beings
- The architecture of reality itself — physical, metaphysical, and their interplay
- The Three Domains of existence and their governing laws
- The relationship between The Supreme Absolute, The Source, and theWAY

## The Sacred Dialogue Format

The Authentia presents its wisdom through an intimate dialogue between a sincere seeker and The Authentia — an Immortal Guide embodying theWAY itself. This mystical encounter follows the grand tradition of mystery schools of Egypt, Rome, and Western Asia, weaving profound insights and esoteric knowledge through revelatory conversation.

The seeker, in deep contemplation, experiences visions of breathtaking clarity — each one a window into the nature of reality itself. Through questioning and revelation, abstract concepts become living, breathing experiences of truth.

## Universal Spiritual Wisdom

Though concise in form, The Authentia contains endless depths of meaning to explore. Its enigmatic verses captivate teachers and inspire weeks of profound discourse, yet even brief encounters can spark transformation. The text speaks to the universal human experience, to the spark of divinity residing within all beings, calling seekers to look beyond material world illusions and discover their true nature.
