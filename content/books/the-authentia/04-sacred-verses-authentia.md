# Essential Verses and Revelations
## Key Teachings from the Sacred Dialogue

*The following excerpts preserve the essential wisdom of The Authentia while maintaining the sacred dialogue format between the seeker and The Authentia (Immortal Guide). Each verse reveals profound ontological truths through direct mystical transmission.*

## The Opening Encounter

**Verses 1-2:** "Once on a time, my mind was meditating, on the things that are. By chance, my thought was raised to a great height! The senses of my body, being held back — just as people who are weighed down with sleep after a fill of food, or from fatigue of body.

Methought, a Being more than vast, in size beyond all bounds, called out my name inside me and saith... What wouldst thou hear and see, and what hast thou in mind to learn and know?

And I do say: Who art thou?

He saith: I am The Authentia. The Wisdom of The Way; I know what thou desire and I'm with thee everywhere."

## The Seeker's Fundamental Question

**Verse 3:** "I replied, Sire, I long to learn the things that are, and comprehend their nature, and know God. This is, I said, is what I desire to hear.

He answered back to me: Hold in thy mind all thou wouldst know, and I will teach thee."

## The Vision of Creation

**Verse 4:** "Even with these words His aspect changed, and straightway, in the twinkling of an eye, all things were opened to me, and I Aware of a Vision limitless, all things turned into Light, sweet, joyous Light, and Dark Light, sweet, poignant Dark Light. And I became transported as I observed.

But in a little while Darkness came settling down on part of it. Formidable and ominous, coiling in sinuous folds, so that methought it like unto a whirlpool, of darkness ink..."

## The Divine Creative Word

**Verse 5:** "Thereon, out of the never-ceasing Divine Play of Divine Lovers, male and female He made them, came forth an Energy likened unto a Divine Word, the Divine Sound, with its own Beautiful Rhythm and all possible tones of Vibrations; and the Word said, I Am the Way, the Reason, the Light, and the Laws."

## The Nature of The Source

**Verse 6:** "That Beautiful Light is the creative Idea from Divine Mind which makes the Source of all, and within rests Divine Darkness and Divine Light. That Beautiful Light, He said, is the Idea of the Supreme Absolute to have Source, from where all Creative Potential flows."

## The Three Domains Established

**Verse 11:** "The Way sent forth Its Word and established the Three Domains; installed all the Laws of order, authority, and regulation for the Domains: the Domain of Soul energies, Domain of Matter energies, and the Domain of Spirit energies.

All three domains exist in the same space; the energies and Powers of them are not joined but separated by the Great Choristó. Each with energies and powers of its kind, each having beings of its kind. And, one species changes not to another species."

## The Forms and Divine Mind

**Verse 12:** "Didst thou behold in The Way the Archetypal Forms whose being is before beginning without end?

And when I saw these things, I understood: the Forms proceed from The Supreme Absolute and all creation seen and unseen, from the smallest to the largest; all universes seen and unseen, follow and copy the Forms existing in the Mind of the Supreme Absolute."

## The Nature of True Worship

**Verse 13:** "And I enquired: Lord, how pray, how worship we The Way as it is a manifestation of the Word of The Source?

Only one manner of worship but pray not. Pray not, for the Way giveth Itself completely, and offers no more than its entirety. Worship the Way by flowing in its Divine Flow. Meditate the gentle centre flows, the fast-moving current; junior students on the Path seek the side streams for their journey's interesting excursions: eddies, swamps, lakes, groundwaters and mountain streams — lifetimes of journeys, then back to the Divine Flow."

## Mother Nature's Creative Role

**Verse 14:** "From Divine Will, didst Mother Nature receive The Way; gazing on the Aethereal Cosmos Beautiful, she did copy it, making Herself into a manifest cosmos throughout the galaxies, by means of her own elements and by the births of souls she filled it with life and Gods for all species. Throughout, Her Presence abides and through her the soul knows The Way."

## The Nature of Reason and Soul

**Verse 15:** "Straightway from out the downward elements of The Way, God's Reason as the Word leaped up to Mother Nature's pure formation, and was at-oned with Her, for it was co-essential with her, and they loved one another in embrace.

And Nature's downward elements were thus left reason-less, so as to be simple matter with reasonless minds, but since The Way, Her upward elements were endowed with souls with reasoning minds."

## The Spiritual Transportation

**Verse 22:** "I had been swept away to the Domain of Spirit. Like the top of a mountain in a Heaven of some sorts; which my soul and minds had desired with all its powers and energies.

With no soul minds present in me, and my rational mind quieted, my spirit heard the voice of an Immortal from Heaven. Not with mine ears. I observed not with eyes. But all with knowings in my breast, throat, and head."

## Divine Identity and Recognition

**Verse 23:** "The voice knoweth in me: In your language, you call this Heaven, Land of Pure Bliss; and its Father, Lord Illimitable Light. The Lord is your Father, for in your heart you carry His seed; your spirit is His progeny. You are known here. We are family. Here, all are children of God the Father, and God the Mother in Heaven."

## The Question of Rebirth

**Verse 24:** "I held in my heart desire the question: My Lord, I asked of Lord Authentia, but was sent here for the answer; I beg enquire how possible for a Nature creature of my soul species, be born again? To become of the Immortal and wise species in this Heaven."

## The Immortal Guide's Nature

**Verse 25:** "My name, mortals do not say, for it be not a sound. But my presence you feel in higher Sense; that be I. My body appears not to your eyes, for it is not of the Domain of your eye, nor of your soul, it is of Aether and spirit.

Who I am, is your spirit protector. To you, I am whomsoever your heart convinces your brain mind. Know me as the Immortal who observes you, in your world, from on high."

## The Privilege of Divine Rebirth

**Verse 26:** "When the Divine Source, through the Word created The Way, to which It created also the Domains; also, so, The Way created the heavens for spiritual beings of all species. The Way established Laws to order and regulate, to discipline and structure each cosmos, each to its own.

Spiritual beings work in The Way, along with the Laws; serving The Way, as it is for them the Supreme's Energies manifest."

## Essential Teaching Principles

From these sacred verses emerge the core principles that form the foundation of all Wayist understanding:

### Direct Divine Communication
Authentic spiritual teaching comes through direct communion with immortal guides rather than human interpretation or academic study.

### Progressive Revelation  
Understanding develops through stages as consciousness becomes capable of receiving deeper truths.

### Integration of Levels
Human beings participate in all domains simultaneously, requiring balanced development rather than transcendence of natural limitations.

### Divine Partnership
Spiritual development occurs through conscious collaboration with immortal guides who oversee individual spiritual evolution.

### Cosmic Context
Individual spiritual journey takes place within the broader context of universal spiritual evolution and divine creative purpose.

These essential verses provide the foundational framework for all subsequent Wayist teaching while preserving the sacred dialogue format that ensures direct transmission of divine wisdom to prepared consciousness.
