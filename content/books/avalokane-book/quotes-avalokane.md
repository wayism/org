>

> 
> *Introduction, page 16*

## On the "If This, Then That" Test

## On the Ten-Mind System

> 
> *Chapter 2, page 35*

> 
> *Chapter 3, page 48*

> "The shift from ordinary perception to mystical beholding represents the fundamental transformation avalokane facilitates."
> 
> *Chapter 3, page 51*

## On Practice Principles
