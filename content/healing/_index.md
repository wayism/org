## The Technical Foundation and the art of Personal Healing

Energy work in Wayism goes beyond traditional meditation and prayer. It's the technical understanding and practical management of the soul energies, body energies, and spiritual energies that flow through us, around us, and connect us to the divine realm.

## What is Energy Work in Wayism?

While **Practice** covers traditional spiritual disciplines like meditation and devotion, **Energy Work** addresses the technical aspects of:

- **Energy awareness** - Recognizing and understanding the subtle energies in daily life: the soul minds, body minds and spirit minds
- **Energy ecology** - How we interact with the shared energy environment of self-parts, other beings, and even technological influences
- **Energy maintenance** - Practical techniques for cleansing, balancing, and protecting your energetic system
- **Divine energy connection** - Technical approaches to connecting with higher energies and Divine Tara guidance

## Core Areas of Wayist Energy Work

### Energy Awareness & Lifestyle
Living with conscious awareness of the energy dynamics that influence every moment of your life. This includes:
- Recognizing energy patterns in relationships, environments, and situations
- Understanding how thoughts, emotions, and actions affect your energy field
- Developing sensitivity to divine guidance and spiritual influences

### Energy Maintenance (Apana)
The technical practices for maintaining energetic health and clarity:
- Energy cleansing techniques
- Protective practices for sensitive environments
- Balancing methods for optimal spiritual function
- Recovery practices after challenging energy encounters

### Divine Energy Connection
Advanced techniques for connecting with higher spiritual energies:
- Divine Tara attunement practices

### Pneumatherapy - Wayist Energy Healing
**Pneumatherapy** (spirit-energy therapy) represents the Wayist approach to energy healing work. This includes:

- **PranaMayati** - The Wayist parallel to energy healing systems like Reiki
- Theoretical foundations for soul and spiritual energy healing
- Energy transmission and receiving techniques
- Professional standards for Wayist energy healing practice

- **Dhatri** - The Wayist full body massage with energy healing intention
- Theoretical foundation for *nadis* and *dosa* energy healing of the body's energetic system
- Energy blockages and disruptors in one's environment (could be diet, medicine, toxins, attitudes)

- **Energy Diagnostics** - Various methods of detecting energies in self and in clients
- We use inherent energy scanning tools built into all humans (many animals also have them)
- We learn what the signals which we become aware of mean and what to make of them
- All energy diagnostics and healing, whether self-healing or in pratitioner-client relationship, involves the Tara(s) of the healer and client. Energy healing is a scared art.

## The Technical Difference

Unlike inspirational spiritual content, this section provides the **theoretical framework** and **technical understanding** behind energy work. It establishes:

- **Terminology standards** for Wayist energy concepts
- **Theoretical foundations** for understanding spiritual energies
- **Technical methods** for practical application
- **Professional guidelines** for those called to energy healing work

## Energy Ecology: Your Shared Energy Environment

We don't exist in energetic isolation. Every day we share energy space with:
- **Self-parts** - Different aspects of your own consciousness
- **Other beings** - Family, colleagues, strangers, and spiritual entities
- **Environmental influences** - Places, objects, and even technological devices
- **Divine presence** - Higher spiritual energies available for connection

Understanding this shared energy ecology is essential for maintaining spiritual balance and accessing divine guidance effectively.
