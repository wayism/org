*The ancient art of soul-spirit therapy*

## What is Pneumatherapy?

Pneumatherapy is the professional practice of spiritual energy healing as preserved and developed in the Wayist tradition for thousands of years. The name comes from ancient Greek "pneuma" (spirit or breath) and means "spirit therapy" or "soul-spirit healing."

Unlike casual energy work or New Age healing modalities, pneumatherapy is a comprehensive system that addresses the whole person - body, soul, mind, and spirit - through skilled partnership with divine guidance.

**Pneumatherapy is different because it:**
- Works with the complete Wayist understanding of human energy anatomy
- Always involves partnership with the client's Tara (Divine Guide)
- Addresses root causes rather than just symptoms
- Prepares practitioners for eternal service as spiritual energy beings
- Maintains ancient wisdom while adapting to modern needs

## Historical Background

### Ancient Origins

Pneumatherapy has been practiced continuously for over 4,000 years:

- **Ancient India (2000+ years ago):** Known as *Jiva-Atman Cikitsa* (Soul-Spirit Therapy)
- **Ancient Greece (500 BCE):** Socrates and Plato taught the importance of treating the immortal soul alongside the mortal body
- **1st Century CE:** When Lord Jesus re-established theWAY, energy healing was central to his ministry - he trained hundreds of energy workers
- **Modern Era:** The practice has been preserved and refined through continuous lineage

### Integration of Wisdom Traditions

Over millennia, pneumatherapy has integrated knowledge from:
- **Indian traditions:** Prana energy, chakra anatomy, dosha understanding
- **Chinese medicine:** Meridian systems and energy flow principles  
- **Greek philosophy:** Soul-body integration and spiritual development
- **Wayist cosmology:** Ten minds, three energy domains, divine partnership

This isn't cultural appropriation but rather the natural evolution of healing wisdom as different cultures contributed their understanding to the ancient foundation.
