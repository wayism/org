*Your step-by-step guide to developing natural healing abilities*

## Your Learning Journey

Developing energy awareness and healing skills is like learning any other ability - it takes time, practice, and proper guidance. This guide provides a structured path that builds skills gradually and safely.

**Important:** Always remember you're not doing this alone. Your Divine Guide (Tara) is there to help, protect, and guide you throughout this journey. Energy healing is a partnership between you, divine guidance, and the person receiving healing.

**Evening (10 minutes):**
- Practice energy hygiene (shower with cleansing intention)
- Gratitude practice (three genuine appreciations)
- Protective visualization before sleep

**Learning Goals:**
- Establish consistent daily practice
- Begin recognizing your natural energy sensitivity
- Create healthy energy habits

**Practice Exercise:**
Daily hand energy sensing - rub palms together, slowly separate, feel the energy between them. Notice changes from day to day.
