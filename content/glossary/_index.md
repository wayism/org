# Wayist Glossary

## Understanding Through Clear Definition

Wayism uses some terms uniquely, often with deeper or different meanings than found in other traditions. This glossary provides clear, logical definitions to support your understanding and practice.

---

## Core Framework Terms

### **The Absolute (THAT)**
The ineffable source beyond all description or comprehension. In Wayism, we simply acknowledge THAT as the causal factor behind all creation, then remain silent rather than limiting the illimitable with inadequate words.

*Etymology*: From Latin *absolutus*, meaning "freed from" - freed from all limitations or definitions.

*How it differs*: Unlike philosophical absolutes that attempt description, Wayist understanding emphasizes the unknowable nature requiring respectful silence.

### **The Source (ONE)**
The first emanation from the Absolute - the origin of all Universal Energy that flows throughout existence. The Source creates the fundamental YinYang polarity from which all other energies derive.

*Related concepts*: Universal Energy, YinYang, theWAY

### **YinYang**
The bipolar energy flowing from the Source, forming the basis of all existence. Unlike popular interpretations, there can never be purely Yin or purely Yang - there is always some of the opposite within each. The inner movement between polarities creates the persistent "sound" or vibration underlying all creation.

*How it differs from common usage*: Not just Chinese philosophy but the fundamental energy structure of reality itself. Often called "The Word" (Sabda in Sanskrit) or symbolized as "OM."

### **theWAY**
The massive energy structure that emerged from the Source, creating the container and laws governing our existence. theWAY brings order to the necessary chaos of the Source, establishing metaphysical and physical laws that make our universe possible.

*Practical understanding*: By aligning with theWAY, we find our path of least resistance through life, flowing with natural rhythms rather than struggling against them.

## Domains of Existence

### **Three Energy Domains**
The complete structure of reality consisting of Material, Soul, and Spirit domains. Everything is fundamentally energy, but these three types exist separately or can co-exist in the same space.

**Material Energy Domain**: The physical realm governed by physics where our incarnated bodies exist, including the three body-minds that create biological consciousness.

**Soul Energy Domain**: Realm of individual consciousness and personality, where souls exist with their three soul-minds (Muladhara, Svadhisthana, Manipura). Characterized by competing for resources, striving to fulfill needs, tribalism, and speciesism.

**Spirit Energy Domain**: Realm of higher consciousness and divine connection, where the four spirit-minds operate (Anahata, Vishuddha, Ajna, Sahasrara). Source of highest aspirations, wisdom, and universal love.

## The Journey of Transformation

### **Butterfly Path**
The comprehensive framework describing soul evolution from temporary learning identity through incarnated experience toward spiritual graduation and immortality. Like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly, souls evolve into immortal spirits capable of cosmic service.

*Key stages*: Soul (learning), Chrysalis (inner transformation), Spirit (graduated service)

*How it differs*: Unlike reincarnation systems focused on karmic "payback," this emphasizes curriculum completion and graduation with a clear endpoint.

### **Hybrid Being**
What humans are - a unique combination of soul and spirit operating through a biological body. During incarnation, we function with ten minds: three body-minds (including brain-mind), three soul-minds, bridge-mind (Anahata), and three spirit-minds.

*Practical understanding*: Your thoughts, emotions, and reactions come from different levels of your being. Understanding this helps identify which "mind" is operating and choose higher responses.

### **School of Divinity**
Earth as a soul education institution where consciousnesses incarnate to learn through experience. The entire planet operates as a curriculum delivery system with perfectly designed learning opportunities.

*How it differs from common views*: Life isn't random suffering or testing - it's systematic education for consciousness development.

## Guidance and Laws

### **Divine Tara**
Personal immortal spirit guide allocated to each human soul since first stepping onto Butterfly Path. "Tara" means "they who ferry us from one shore to the next." Each person can cultivate a cognitive, two-way relationship with their Tara.

*Communication methods*: Intuition, dreams, spiritual insight, and direct attunement through the heart/Anahata mind.

*How it differs*: Unlike guardian angels or spirit guides in other traditions, Divine Taras are specifically assigned educational mentors who respect free will while providing guidance.

### **Karma**
The curriculum assignment and experience delivery system - not punishment but education. Karma organizes learning opportunities perfectly suited to each soul's developmental needs and readiness level.

*How it differs from popular understanding*: Not "what goes around comes around" but rather "what you need to learn gets arranged." 

*Practical application*: Every experience, especially difficult ones, contains curriculum designed for your growth.

### **Dharma**
Your evolved personal moral code based on integrated wisdom. With each layer of wisdom gained, you inherit the duty to act accordingly. Dharma becomes your spiritual "software" - your inherent sense of right action.

*How it differs*: Not external religious law but your own internally generated ethics based on accumulated understanding.

*Key principle*: "Wisdom is not wisdom if you don't live it."

### **Maya**
The "reality filter" that enables fresh learning by creating protective forgetting. Maya allows focus on current lifetime lessons without overwhelming memory of previous experiences.

*How it differs*: Not illusion to escape but necessary educational tool. Maya enables engagement rather than detachment.

### **Free Will**
Operates within the karmic curriculum structure. You have complete freedom to choose how to respond to your perfectly arranged learning opportunities.

*Balance point*: Curriculum is arranged, but your response choices determine the pace and quality of your learning.

## Consciousness and Practice

### **Soul-Minds vs Spirit-Minds**
**Soul-minds** (Muladhara, Svadhisthana, Manipura): Lower chakras focused on survival, emotional security, power, and individual identity. Source of competing, acquiring, and ego-driven responses.

**Spirit-minds** (Anahata, Vishuddha, Ajna): Higher chakras concerned with unconditional love, truth, intuition, and spiritual realization. Source of wisdom, service, and universal connection.

*Practical understanding*: Learning to identify which level of mind is operating helps you choose higher responses and align with spiritual development.

### **Mystiception**
Heightened spiritual perception transcending ordinary consciousness, characterized by profound unity, insight, and divine connection. Primarily experienced through spirit-minds rather than rational intellect.

*Related terms*: Mysticeptive Capacity (your potential for these states), Mysticeptive Gateway (threshold to spiritual experience), Mysticeptual Insight (wisdom arising from these states).

### **Divine Tarayoga**
Sacred practice of attuning spiritual energy and consciousness to your Divine Tara through visualization, mantra, and devotion. "Yoga" means "to yoke" - spiritually connecting with your guide so you don't walk the path alone.

*How it differs from popular yoga*: Focuses on spiritual connection rather than physical postures, though may include movement.

### **Karman Active Meditation**
Sacred practice combining mindful movement, breathwork, and spiritual attunement through fourteen symbolic movements. Harmonizes body, mind, soul, and spirit energies for divine connection.

### **Theopathy**
Intensely profound spiritual experience characterized by direct, empathetic connection with the divine, accompanied by overwhelming love, reverence, awe, and unity.

### **Chrestotes**
Fundamental Wayist principle surpassing compassion and love by translating into tangible action and support. The pinnacle of wisdom in service to others.

*Etymology*: From Greek meaning "useful kindness" or "practical goodness."

### **Psychomesion**
Intermediate realm between physical reality and higher spiritual realms where souls may linger after death. From Greek "psyche" (soul) and "mesos" (middle).

*Related concept*: Malipsyches - harmful disembodied souls lurking in this realm, expelled from Butterfly Path education.

### **Sukhavati**
"Pure Land of Bliss" - the heaven realm for our type of consciousness within the Spirit Domain, managed by God our Father and God our Mother.

*Etymology*: Sanskrit meaning "possessing happiness" or "blissful."

## Values and Way of Life

### **People of theWAY**
Traditional term for Wayists used for millennia, emphasizing fundamental life orientation rather than religious membership. In most languages, we've always been known as "People of theWAY" rather than using "-ism" and "-ist" suffixes.

### **Authenticity**
Striving to know the true self and live from spiritual essence rather than ego-constructed identity. Dynamic alignment between essential nature and its temporal expression.

### **Graduated Spirits**
Souls who have completed their Butterfly Path education and become immortal spiritual beings. They often serve as guides, teachers, and helpers for souls still in the educational process.

## Practical Understanding

### **Ten Minds**
The complete consciousness system humans operate with during incarnation:
- 3 body-minds (brain-mind, organ-minds, microbiome collective mind)
- 3 soul-minds (Muladhara, Svadhisthana, Manipura)  
- 1 bridge-mind (Anahata - connects soul and spirit)
- 3 spirit-minds (Vishuddha, Ajna, Sahasrara)

### **Metanoia** 
Greek term used by Jesus meaning "making over the soul-minds" - the process of sanctifying and transforming lower consciousness patterns through spiritual development.
