Metaphysical Law pertaining to our School of Divinity. <p>The neccessary shielding from awareness of Reality. We cannot, it will break you. This is also why we dont remember past lives 1) knowledge memory fades away as the brain-mind ages and dies because its useful only to navigate this life. 2) we can use knowledge to form wisdom, which travels with the soul-minds and spirit-minds, and evolve soul to spirit. But wisdom derives from past lives does not mean knoweldge or brain-mind memory of past lives.
