There are other such spaces but our &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; or &ldquo;species&rdquo; of spirit being live in Sukhavati (Gautama Buddhda said this Heaven is in the &ldquo;western portion of spirit realm&rdquo; whatever that may mean). All beings who exist there are inorganic made of spirit energy, therefore immortal, and they are compared to soul beings like us wiser by many degrees. We refer to them as deities, gods, some call them buddhas. The two energy entities in chrage of our Heaven are our God our Father, and God our Mother in Heaven. These beings hold their Yang/Yin roles to create the balance needed for wholesome governance.
#Why Father / Mother
When soul beings first are accepted to our School of Divinity they enter via Paradise. there, they are assigned a tutor-like guardin, we call a Tara. They are also given a 4th soul mind, Anahata. This soul mind is capable of developing deeper levels of loving-kindness, love and compassion that what the soul-being was capable of before. In that chakra-mind is placed a &ldquo;divine spark&rdquo;, like a seed of divinity. As analogy, once the heart-mind devbelops sufficient chrestotes (helpful loving-kindness) the seed of divinity germinates. That seed was donated by God our Father, it is a true part of His being. In the heart-mind, the Yin forces of heaven (our Tara, working under auspices of God our Mother in Heaven) helps the soul with intuition and mystical insight to make increasingly deeper self-knowlege and self craft possible.
This is how we sanctify our souls to one day be &ldquo;born again&rdquo; as fledgling immortal spirits in Heaven where we become part of the holy family (also referred to by Wayists as Holy Lotus Family)and be trained to become a helper being in our galazy, to help soul beings in need wherever we are called.
This is why we are learning from soul experiences, and living among soul-beings of all kinds, so we can aquire the insight and skills to one day be a helper to them no matter the planet they live on no matter the physical form they may take on that world of theirs.
So, the deities in charge of our Heaven are truly our Father and our Mother because we became in their image.
